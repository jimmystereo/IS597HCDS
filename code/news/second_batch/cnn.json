And I hope that that means they can get access to the care they need,\u201d L. Williams, one of the minors challenging the law, told CNN, referring to other trans kids facing health care bans like Tennessee\u2019s.CNNRelated article26 states have passed laws restricting gender-affirming care for trans youthThe conservative-majority court will examine the law at a critical time for transgender Americans. Since 2020, Republican-led states around the country have passed a wave of laws regulating the lives of trans Americans, with a particular focus on minors. And though the community makes up a small fraction of the American public, it featured prominently duringthe 2024 election and its aftermath,with President-elect Donald Trump amplifying his pledge to further curtail civil rights for trans people during the closing days of the campaign.Depending on how the court rules, similar prohibitions on gender-affirming care \u2013 and, potentially, other laws targeting transgender people \u2013 would be at risk of falling altogether or receiving a powerful endorsement from the high court.Here\u2019s what to know about the case:Justices may decide how much protection transgender people haveThe case, known asUS v. Skrmetti,represents only the second time in recent years that the court has been tasked withdeciding the extent to which federal law protects transgenderpeople from discrimination.The last time the court tackled that question was in a case from 2020 calledBostock v. Clayton County. In that matter, the majority, led by conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, ruled that federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in the workplace applies to gay and transgender workers since such action \u201cnecessarily\u201d happens because of that person\u2019s sex.The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in US v. Skrmetti on December 4, 2024 in Washington, DC.Kevin Mohatt/Reuters/FileRelated articleHow a Supreme Court decision on health care bans for transgender youth could impact trans people nationwideSince then, lower courts around the country have grappled with how to apply the legal rationale that emerged inBostockin other cases dealing with transgender issues.This case will have an even greater impact on other laws concerning transgender people, legal experts say. That\u2019s partly because the court may decide whether trans Americans as a group are entitled to receive protection from discrimination.\u201cThis is going to be their first opportunity to address the rights of the transgender community under the equal protection clause, especially in view of the vast proliferation of state legislation targeting transgender individuals, and, in particular, transgender youth,\u201d said Katie Eyer, a professor at Rutgers Law School who joined a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the law\u2019s challengers.\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important case,\u201d she added. \u201cIt will set the tone for and set the law for what type of scrutiny these laws will be subjected to across the board.\u201dWhat the Tennessee law doesThe Tennessee law at the center of Wednesday\u2019s arguments wassigned by Republican Gov. Bill Lee in 2023.Known as SB 1, the measure bans hormone therapy and puberty blockers for minors in the state and imposes civil penalties for doctors who violate the prohibitions. It also bans gender-affirming surgeries, though that provision is not at issue in the case.Specifically, the law prohibits providers in the state from administering such care if the purpose is to enable \u201ca minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex,\u201d or treat \u201cpurported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity.\u201dThe Republican lawmakers who crafted the law wrote in their legislative findings that \u201cminors lack the maturity to fully understand and appreciate the life-altering consequences of such procedures\u201d and that the state \u201chas a legitimate, substantial, and compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty.\u201dCrucially, the law makes an exception for doctors to provide the same otherwise prohibited care to cisgender minors seeking treatment for a congenital defect or early puberty, among other things.CNNRelated article26 states have passed laws restricting gender-affirming care for trans youthA slew of other GOP-led states havepassed similar health care bans in recent years.Today, more than 110,000 teenagers live in states where restrictions on puberty blockers and hormone therapy exist, according to theWilliams Institute at UCLA School of Law.\u2018Life-changing\u2019 careL. Williams told CNN this week that receiving gender-affirming care has been \u201clife-changing,\u201d giving her more confidence as she navigates adolescence.\u201cIt\u2019s been very helpful, very helpful \u2013 life-changing,\u201d she said. \u201cFor some people, it\u2019s even been life-saving.\u201dThe state\u2019s ban has forced her to travel out of state to continue receiving care for her gender dysphoria, the medical term for an uncomfortable conflict between a person\u2019s assigned gender and the gender with which the person identifies. The travel is a stressful reality that has caused the high school junior to frequently miss school.\u201cIt\u2019s also very terrifying because I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do without the care because it certainly left me in a much better place mentally than I was a few years ago,\u201d she said of the state\u2019s decision to restrict the care. \u201cI was just terrified of what would happen.\u201dWilliams will be in the courtroom on Wednesday to witness the historic arguments unfold \u2013 a unique position that seemed unlikely for the 16-year-old.\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine that I would be headed to the Supreme Court,\u201d she said.How the case got to SCOTUSSB 1 was initially challenged by three trans minors in Tennessee, their parents and a doctor in the state whose practice included intreating minors for gender dysphoria.The Biden administration later joined that lawsuit and a federal judge in Tennessee sided with the challengers in June 2023.Judge Eli Richardson, a Trump appointee, said in a ruling temporarily blocking the law that the measure violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. The judge reviewed the law under a standard of review known as heightened scrutiny and decided that since it \u201clikely is not substantially related to the state\u2019s asserted interest\u201d it is unconstitutional.Notably, Richardson ruled that SB1 \u201cdiscriminates based on transgender status and that transgender individuals constitute a quasi-suspect class\u201d that qualify for additional protections under the law.The state appealed to the Cincinnati-based 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which decided that the law should be subject to the lowest standard of review, called rational basis. A divided three-judge panel said that transgender people are not part of a \u201cquasi-suspect class\u201d and that the legal reasoning inBostockdoes not apply outside the context of workplace discrimination.The appeals court ruling was authored by Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton, a George W. Bush appointee, and joined by Judge Amul Thapar, a Trump appointee. Judge Helene White, a Bush appointee, dissented.The challengers filed separate appeals to the Supreme Court, which decided in June to review only the administration\u2019s case.What each side will argueThe case will turn on what level of scrutiny the justices decide is appropriate for examining SB 1. But that ruling, expected before July, will extend far beyond Tennessee\u2019s borders: It will help guide judges on lower courts who are handling disputes related to anti-trans laws on bathroom access, school sports and pronouns, among other things.The US Supreme Court is seen on the first day of a new term in Washington, DC, on October 7, 2024.Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleIn transgender care case, Supreme Court to consider how far equal protection goesLawyers for the Biden administration have asked the justices to consider whether the law passes constitutional muster under heightened scrutiny, which requires states to show they have an important government interest in banning treatment and that the law achieves that goal in a way that\u2019s \u201csubstantially related\u201d to its interest.Should the Supreme Court examine the law under that standard, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogarwrote in court papers,\u201cit should hold that SB1 cannot survive heightened scrutiny\u201d based on a long line of cases in which the court \u201chas consistently held that all sex-based classifications are subject to heightened scrutiny because such classifications too often reflect stereotypes about how men and women should look or act.\u201dThe administration told the court that \u201ctransgender individuals satisfy all of the hallmarks of a quasi-suspect class,\u201d a position that, if adopted by the high court, would also give the advocates for the community a powerful tool when challenging laws like SB 1 in court.Prelogar also told the justices that they could, alternatively, send the case back to the appeals court to consider whether SB 1 is constitutional under the higher standard of review it prefers.For its part, Tennessee has told the court that the law \u201cincludes no sex classification\u201d and that it instead draws an age- and use-based distinction that is permissible under the equal protection clause. In other words, the state says, the law bars the treatment for both boys and girls who want to transition.Attorneys for the state urged the justices to not \u201cget back in the fraught business of creating suspect classes\u201d and warned that doing so in this case would, in their view, wrongly give transgender women the same legal protections as cisgender women.\u201cIf the government\u2019s theory holds, men who identify as women could claim constitutionally based access to women\u2019s bathrooms, women\u2019s locker rooms, and women\u2019s sports,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAccepting that theory would perversely erode women\u2019s rights and jeopardize landmark statutes protecting women\u2019s equal access to schools, winners\u2019 podiums, and beyond.\u201dRoberts, Gorsuch among the justices to watchThe Supreme Courtlast touched on transgender rights in a substantive way four years agoin a surprising decision that held federal law bars discrimination against gay and transgender employees in the workplace.The reason: Such discrimination is necessarily based on sex.Part of the reason why theBostockdecisionwasunexpected was because of the author: Gorsuch. The Trump nominee was joined in the majority by Chief Justice John Roberts as well as the court\u2019s liberal wing. The court\u2019s other conservatives at the time \u2013 Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 dissented.\u201cIt is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex,\u201d the 6-3 majority said.Because the Biden administration is relying in part on Bostock, both Roberts and Gorsuch will be key votes to watch during the arguments.The Bostock majority stressed that the decision dealt only with the workplace. But trans rights advocates say it\u2019s difficult to see how the logic the court used in Bostock \u2013 that discrimination against transgender workers is necessarily discrimination based on sex \u2013 wouldn\u2019t apply in other contexts.Another justice to watch is Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 a Trump nominee who sometimes breaks with conservative ideology.Barrett wasn\u2019t sitting on the court when Bostock was decided. She was picked to fill the seat of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon whose death a few months afterBostockwas decided helped move the court further to the right.Justices will hear from trans lawyerChase Strangio, one of three attorneys who will be parrying questions from the justices over the course of the arguments, will make history as thefirst known transgender personto argue before the Supreme Court.Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, will be speaking on behalf of the three transgender minors and their families who initially challenged the Tennessee law.\u201cIt is not lost on me that I will be standing there at the lectern at the Supreme Court in part because I was able to have access to the medical care that is the very subject of the case that we\u2019re litigating,\u201d Strangio told CNN.Prelogar will argue first, representing the Biden administration. Widely respected for her advocacy among both conservatives and liberals, it is possible the trans case will be Prelogar\u2019s last major argument before the high court.Tennessee will be represented by J. Matthew Rice, a former clerk to Justice Thomas \u2013 and one-time professional baseball player \u2013 who is making his debut before the justices.A fight over medicineIntertwined with the legal arguments over the law is a fight over the thorny issue of modern medicine and which health experts the court should listen more closely to.Major medical associations \u2013 including theAmerican Medical Association, theAmerican Psychiatric Associationand theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\u2013 agree gender-affirming care isclinically appropriatefor children and adults, and research showsthe risk of suicideis high among youth who experience gender dysphoria.The Biden administration and a host of outside groups have leaned into those points as they\u2019ve asked the court to consider the impact of a ruling in favor of Tennessee.\u201cDenying access to medical care and treating transgender youth disparately because of their transgender status are correlated with substantially increased risks of suicide and negative mental health outcomes,\u201d the Trevor Project, a nonprofit that works to prevent suicide among LGBTQ youth, told the justices in one friend-of-the-court brief.On the other hand, Tennessee\u2019s attorneys describe the banned treatments as \u201crisky, unproven gender-transition interventions\u201d that they say can cause irreversible changes to minors.\u201cWhile the government is free to favor its transition-first, ask-questions-later approach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to that same choice,\u201d they wrote.Among the groups backing Tennessee\u2019s approach is Do No Harm, Inc., a conservative medical advocacy group whose chairman told CNN that while the organization doesn\u2019t oppose gender-affirming care for adults, it believes such care should not be administered to minors.\u201cAdults can do as they as they will, and there are perfectly fine people that have transitioned. That\u2019s their business,\u201d said Dr. Stanley Goldfarb. \u201cBut we feel that children just are really unable to do this in a way that involves informed consent, primarily, and that many of them are just children that are very troubled.\u201dTrump looms large over historic caseTrump ran for reelection in part on a message of ending \u201ctransgender craziness\u201d and he specifically attacked Vice President Kamala Harris for supporting \u201cthey/them,\u201d a reference to pronouns sometimes used by transgender and non-binary individuals. The Skrmetti appeal is likely to still be pending at the Supreme Court when Trump moves into the White House on January 21.If the incoming Department of Justice announces it is changing positions, that could give the Supreme Court an out \u2013 an opportunity to dismiss the appeal. On the other hand, with the case fully briefed and argued there\u2019s a good chance the court would simply proceed as planned.\u201cIt\u2019s not all that unusual,\u201d said Pratik Shah, a veteran Supreme Court attorney who is working with the ACLU on behalf of the trans clients. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t change anything in terms of the court\u2019s ability and process for deciding the case.\u201dCNN\u2019s Casey Gannon and Chelsea Bailey contributed to this report."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Supreme Court majority appears skeptical of allowing Holocaust survivors to sue Hungary in US courts", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/politics/supreme-court-holocaust-hungary-oral-arguments/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014A majority of the Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared skeptical that Holocaust victims and their families are permitted to haul Hungary into American courts to recover property stolen during World War II, with several justices fearing that would open the United States up to a flood of similar litigation from abroad.More than a dozen victims of the Holocaust and their families have been fighting the Republic of Hungary and its national railway for nearly 15 years over whether they may continue their lawsuit in federal courts under a narrow exception to the general prohibition on suing foreign governments in the United States.The US Supreme Court is seen on the first day of a new term in Washington, DC, on October 7, 2024.Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleIn transgender care case, Supreme Court to consider how far equal protection goesHungary \u201a\u00c4\u00fastole respondents\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 property while forcing them onto cattle cars,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Shay Dvoretzky, representing the families, told the Supreme Court during about 90 minutes of arguments.

But federal law in the United States includes an exception when a case involves expropriated property that is present in the US. The families say the money Hungary received when it liquidated the property it stole from Jewish families was comingled with other funds and that some portion of that money was then spent in the US.Because of that, the families argue, the exception should apply.But their position drew sharp questioning from Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, two conservatives who sit at the center of the court and most often wind up with the majority when decisions are handed down.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is really just throwing out the whole sovereign immunity principles under which the rest of the world operates,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Roberts said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faCongress had in mind a much narrower exception than that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Kavanaugh said he was concerned about the foreign policy implications of a ruling for the families, worrying other nations might reciprocate and make it easier for people to sue the United States.\u201a\u00c4\u00faNo other country in the world has an expropriation exception to begin with, right?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kavanaugh pressed Dvoretzky. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a big deal to haul a foreign country into US court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Several of the court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s liberals also appeared to have reservations with the families\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 argument.

We seek a better way, transparent, high standard, open access to investment that protects workers and the rule of law and the environment. It can be done and will be done,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the president said.Biden delivered his remarks even as he was grappling with an unexpected situation in South Korea, where President Yoon Suk Yeoldeclared martial lawin a surprise late-night address Tuesday. The US is closely monitoring the situation and is in touch with the South Korean government, and Biden told reporters after his remarks that he would be getting a full briefing soon.The president also reflected on a theme that he has mentioned throughout this presidency: his belief that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the United States\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 duty to both acknowledge and face its history.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhile history can be hidden, it cannot and should not be erased.

He also announced over $1 billion in new US humanitarian assistance for Africans who have been displaced byhistoric droughtsacross the continent.\u201a\u00c4\u00faBut we know African leaders and citizens are seeking more than just aid.

The funding allows the Defense Department to draw from its own stockpiles to send weapons, but shortages have limited how much the US can send to Kyiv in recent months.For months, the US has run into the limits of its ability to replenish its own weapons inventories, which limited what the Biden administration has been able to send Ukraine.

In fact, Macron treated him with such deference at a Bastille Day parade on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es that Trumpcame home wanting a military parade of his own\u2014 on July Fourth.As Trump prepares to become the 47th president, Macron has surpassed himself,inviting Trumpto attend the year\u2019s most vaunted opening \u2014 the unveiling of the newly restored Notre Dame Cathedral five years after a savage fire.Putting Trump at the center of the star-studded VIP event, which will mark his big return to the global stage, says everything about the power fast flowing back to the president-elect six weeks before he begins his second term.Trump isn\u2019t waiting until January to launch his new foreign policy \u2014 he\u2019s already threatened a trade war with Canada and Mexico and showed who is boss when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rushed to Florida to appease him last week. And on Monday, he warned that there will be \u201cALL HELL TO PAY\u201d in the Middle East if Hamas doesn\u2019t release hostages in Gaza before Inauguration Day.Trump\u2019s starring role in Paris will also mark a poignant contrast with Joe Biden\u2019s increasingly ignominious long goodbye. The president came under fierce criticism Monday, even from within his own party, after he pardoned his son Hunter, undercutting a core principle of his term \u2014 that everyone is equal before the law.\u201cHe didn\u2019t need to tell the American public, \u2018I will not do this\u2019 and he did \u2026 and when you made a promise, you gotta keep it,\u201d Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney added: \u201cIt was a terrible decision and it just made me heart sick.\u201dThe announcement of Trump\u2019s trip to Paris came as Biden landed in Angola for an official presidential visit that is sure to include far more substance than Trump\u2019s journey. The president seeks to highlight US commitment to sub-Saharan Africa in the face of China\u2019s investment-led regional power play. Trump never made it to Africa as president and seemed more interested in insulting the continent than helping it. Biden\u2019s visit will also showcase one of the most successful US global policies in decades \u2013 the massive program fighting HIV/AIDS in Africa that faces an uncertain future when Trump returns to the White House.But the president-elect\u2019s far more visible jaunt to the City of Light will stress how he is again the American that foreign leaders want to court as Biden increasingly fades from the international scene.Trump\u2019s win presented every global leader with a dilemmaPerhaps most significantly, Trump\u2019s trip will highlight the dilemma with which every world leader is wrestling: how to deal with a new American president who is certain to be more aggressive and capricious on the world stage than he was even in his first turbulent term \u2014 and who often prefers the company of tyrants over allies.The president-elect is reveling in his return to the international spotlight after news broke of Macron\u2019s invitation Monday. \u201cPresident Emmanuel Macron has done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.The trip promises all that the president-elect most appreciates. A chance to seize the spotlight; the adulation of being an honored guest; and the fanfare of being part of a unique spectacle likely to attract millions of eyeballs across the globe.It\u2019s also the kind of eye-catching gambit for which Macron is known \u2014 but that sometimes comes unstuck. The French president\u2019s impulsive gesture earlier this year, for example, to call snap parliamentary elections backfired spectacularly and plunged the country into a governing crisis.France's President Emmanuel Macron talks to French media in Buenos Aires province on November 17.Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty ImagesMacron\u2019s invitation is the latest move in the never-ending tussle among European powers to be Washington\u2019s top conduit on the other side of the Atlantic. Macron has long sought to position France as the dominant European power \u2014 especially since the retirement of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was promoting her memoirs in Washington on Monday night alongside former President Barack Obama, who in 2016urged her to save the West from Trump.Trump\u2019s second coming has sparked a similar sense of crisis among Western powers, who are worried that he will desert Ukraine in order to please his friend, Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid rising expectations that the president-elect will threaten massive tariffs against the European Union. There\u2019s also concern that Trump will fracture NATO in his second term, after he said on the campaign trail that he\u2019d tell Russia it could do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to alliance members that don\u2019t meet guidelines for minimum defense spending.Macron, by deploying the power of symbolism and pulling off the coup of a first foreign visit even before Trump retakes office, seems to have a head start on his rivals. There\u2019s little competition from Germany, where Chancellor Olaf Scholz seems destined to soon follow Biden into the political wilderness after the collapse of his governing coalition with an election set for February. New British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is stronger but has a balancing act as Trump is deeply unpopular in his ruling Labour Party. And Britain lacks European clout after it left the EU in a populist outburst that delighted Trump and foreshadowed his 2016 victory. In a major foreign policy speech on Monday night, Starmer rejected the idea that the United Kingdom must pick between its friendships with the United States and Europe \u2013 a choice some observers fear Trump might force it to make. He also recalled his meeting with Trump in September, weeks before the US election. \u201cWhen President Trump graciously hosted me for dinner in Trump Tower, I told him that we will invest more deeply than ever in this transatlantic bond with our American friends in the years to come,\u201d Starmer said.Macron, hugely unpopular deep into his second term, is not the force he once was either. His invitation to Trump is rich in irony since the far-right Trump-friendly National Rally Party is threatening to topple Prime Minister Michel Barnier in a move that would further weaken the president and cause even more disarray. There are growing signs that Macron\u2019s legacy might end up mirroring Biden\u2019s \u2014 as a president forced to hand over power to nationalist, populist forces he defined his administration as fighting against. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, whose anti-immigrant ideology is similar to Trump\u2019s, may have her best shot yet at making it through France\u2019s two-stage presidential election system to win power in 2027.How the first-term bromance went all wrongMacron\u2019s daring new overture to Trump is likely to trigger an outpouring of mutual praise. But if history is anything to go by, it won\u2019t last.The first time around, the Macrons and the Trumps dined at the Michelin-starred Jules Verne restaurant at the Eiffel Tower, whispered to one-another at the Bastille Day parade, then kissed and held hands at the White House. In the Oval Office in April 2018, Trump said, \u201cWe have to make him perfect, he is perfect,\u201d as he brushed what he said was dandruff off the French president\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEmmanuel will go down as one of your great presidents,\u201d Trump told the French people.From left to right, Brigitte Macron, President-elect Donald Trump, Melania Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron at Le Jules Verne Restaurant at the Eiffel Tower, on July 13, 2017.Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesThe bromance didn\u2019t last, however, as Trump\u2019s hostility to Europe got in the way. Things really went off the rails during a visit by the US leader to France later in 2018. Trump reacted poorly to Macron\u2019s push for a European army \u2014 ironically, a partial response to the US leader\u2019s frequent complaints about the need for American taxpayers to bankroll the continent\u2019s defense. Trump called the idea \u201cvery insulting,\u201d later mocked Macron\u2019s \u201cvery low approval rating in France, 26%\u201d and tweeted support for his nationalist foes.While Trump seems prepared to give it another shot, Macron \u2014 who, like Biden, styles himself as a protector of democracy and a bulwark against far-right nationalism \u2014 is far from the president-elect\u2019s favorite European leader. That honor belongs to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, a frequent guest at Mar-a-Lago, whose blueprint for eroding democracy, curtailing press freedom and politicizing justice is far more to Trump\u2019s taste. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like him because he\u2019s too strong,\u201d Trump said during a rally in New Hampshire during his primary campaign in January. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a strong man at the head of a country.\u201dStill, both Macron and Trump place great importance on relationships between foreign leaders \u2014 so perhaps they can rekindle the spark where it all began.Trump will arrive in Paris shortly after selecting Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of his daughter Ivanka as the next US ambassador to France. On the one hand, this pick might be seen by some as an insult to America\u2019s longest diplomatic friendship since Kushner was convicted of tax evasion and witness retaliation charges and was pardoned by Trump. But the French long ago perfected the art of diplomatic discretion, and in some ways, Kushner\u2019s selection might be seen as a compliment \u2014 he is, after all, family for Trump \u2014 and therefore has his ear.Kushner\u2019s appointment may also offer the chance of a reentry to high society, on the world\u2019s most glittering diplomatic circuit, for Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, who now live in Florida, far from their former haunts in Manhattan where the name Trump became anathema to elite liberal chattering classes.This story has been updated with additional details."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Biden\u2019s pardon of his son pours fuel on Trump\u2019s claims of politicized justice", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/02/politics/hunter-biden-pardon-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014PresidentJoe Biden\u2019s pardon of his son Hunter deepened an entanglement of politics and the rule of law that has tarnished faith in American justice and is almost certain to worsen inDonald Trump\u2019s second term.TheSunday evening movewas a stunning development since Biden came to office vowing to restore the independence of the Justice Department, which had been eroded during Trump\u2019s first term, and because he had repeatedly said he wouldn\u2019t pardon his son.President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden disembark from Air Force One in Syracuse, New York, on February 4, 2023.Elizabeth Frantz/ReutersRelated articleBiden\u2019s pardon of his son makes presidential historyNow, weeks before he leaves the White House, Biden has wielded presidential power to absolve his son ahead of sentencings later this month over a pair ofgunandtaxconvictions that emerged from the due process of law.His decision came days after special counsel Jack Smithmoved to dismissthe federal cases against Trump \u2014 over election interference and the hoarding of classified documents \u2014 on the grounds that presidents can\u2019t be prosecuted.Taken together, the convergence of legal controversies raises questions about the bedrock notion that underpins the system of justice in the United States that everyone \u2014 even presidents and their families \u2014 are equal before the law.Until Sunday, Biden had not intervened in the cases against his son, and the White House always insisted that he wouldn\u2019t, even though the shifting political environment caused by Trump\u2019s election victory last month seemed likely to shift his calculations. Biden started informing staff of his decision on Saturday evening, a source familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Arlette Saenz, and his team regrouped on Sunday morning to iron out the details.Massive political reverberationsPolitically, Biden\u2019s reversal may be seen as a stain on his legacy and his credibility. It contributes to an ignominious end for a presidency that dissolved in his disastrous debate performance in June and that will now be remembered as much for opening the way for Trump\u2019s return to the White House as evicting him four years ago.Rep. Glenn Ivey, a Maryland Democrat, acknowledged to Kasie Hunt on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d Monday that the pardon will be wielded politically against Democrats.\u201cI\u2019ve got mixed views about it, frankly,\u201d Ivey said.The president also may have offered an opening for Trump\u2019s party to rally behind Kash Patel,the loyalist whom the president-elect pickedSaturday evening to lead the FBI and serve as an apparent agent of his campaign of political retribution.There is no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the president. An impeachment inquiry by House Republicans that looked at Biden\u2019s and his son\u2019s business relationships \u2014 which Democrats saw as an attempt to inflict political damage ahead of the election \u2014went nowhere. And the cases against Hunter Biden lack the constitutional gravity or historic importance of theindictments against Trumpand his frequent attacks on the rule of law.President Joe Biden, wearing a Team USA jacket and walking with his son Hunter Biden, heads toward Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, July 26, 2024.Susan Walsh/APRelated articleJoe Biden\u2019s pardon reversal reflects family loyalty over legacyBut the political impact of Sunday night\u2019s drama could be profound. Already, Republicans are arguing the Hunter Biden pardon shows that the current president, and not the next one, is most to blame for politicizing the system of justice by meting out favorable treatment to his son. Their claim may not be accurate, but it can still be politically effective.Trump used pardons to protect multiple political aides and contacts during his first term,including his daughter\u2019s father-in-law, who\u2019s now hispick for ambassador to France. But any time in the future that Trump is criticized for his use of pardon power, he will be able to argue that Biden did the same to protect his own kin.This could be especially significant as Trump comes under pressure from supporters in the coming months to pardon those convicted of crimes related to the January 6, 2021, mob attack on the US Capitol \u2014 many of whomare still in jail.Yet Biden, after a life of tragedies and heartache, asked Americans tojudge him as a fatherwho was clearly worried about the impact of a potential jail term on his son, a recovering addict.Trump and Biden now both argue that the Justice Department was politicizedHunter Biden was convicted by a jury in June of illegally buying and possessing a gun after a trial that exposed his drug abuse and family dysfunction. He pleaded guilty in September to nine tax offenses, stemming from $1.4 million in taxes that he didn\u2019t pay while spending lavishly on escorts, strippers, cars and drugs.There is some validity to the president\u2019s claim in his Sunday statement that his son was \u201ctreated differently\u201d because of who his father is. Charges relating to the illegal possession of a firearm while being addicted to a controlled substance and regarding a false statement on the matter are quite rare, for instance. And Republican congressional probes into the matter, which imploded over a lack of evidence, looked like naked attempts to damage the president.Hunter Biden, son of U.S. President Joe Biden, departs federal court after a  plea hearing on two misdemeanor charges of willfully failing to pay income taxes in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. July 26, 2023. REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstJonathan Ernst/ReutersRelated articleREAD: Statement from President Joe Biden announcing the pardon of his son Hunter Biden\u201cNo reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter\u2019s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2014 and that is wrong,\u201d Joe Biden said in the statement. \u201cThere has been an effort to break Hunter \u2014 who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they\u2019ve tried to break me \u2014 and there\u2019s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.\u201dHis statement is extraordinary because Biden is now arguing something rather similar to Trump \u2014 that his own Justice Department has been unfairly politicized. Biden was referring to the way that the Hunter Biden case was handled by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed US attorney from Delaware who originally investigated the president\u2019s son and was later appointed as a special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland.Yet at the same time, Hunter Biden put himself in a position in which he created a political vulnerability and potential conflict of interest for his father. In addition, his business activities in Ukraine and China while his father was vice president and afterward raised serious ethical questions, even though Republicans have failed to produce evidence for claims that the current president benefited from the transactions.It is significant, therefore, that Joe Biden\u2019s pardon includes any activity by his son starting on January 1, 2014 \u2014 the year that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company \u2014 while his father, who was then vice president, was deeply involved in US policy toward Kyiv.While the pardon is its own distinct controversy, it may not have happened but for the extraordinary circumstances of a fraught political moment, with Trump due to return to power at noon on January 20.Kash Patel speaks during a campaign event for Republican election candidates at the Whiskey Roads Restaurant & Bar on July 31, 2022 in Tucson, Arizona.Brandon Bell/Getty Images/FileRelated articleTrump plans to replace current FBI director with firebrand Kash Patel, drawing bipartisan fireGiven the selection of Patel to head the FBI and Trump\u2019s second pick for attorney general,Pam Bondi, there are reasonable grounds to expect that Hunter Biden may have been among those whom the president-elect\u2019s loyalists were likely to target, given their vows to use their powers to go after his enemies.And now that he\u2019s acted to protect his son, Joe Biden may face calls to cast a much wider net with his pardon authority, perhaps to include prosecutors who worked on cases against Trump, including over his attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 election.The president-elect moved quickly to capitalize on the situation in a comment that will raise expectations that he will issue pardons for January 6 convicts shortly after he takes office again.\u201cDoes the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Sunday. \u201cSuch an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\u201dAnd Trump\u2019s Republican allies sought to use the situation to bolster the chances of Senate confirmation for some of his most provocative picks. \u201cDemocrats can spare us the lectures about the rule of law when, say, President Trump nominates Pam Bondi and Kash Patel to clean up this corruption,\u201d Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton wrote on X.No moral high ground for TrumpStill, the idea that there is any moral high ground for Trump \u2014 who issued a string of apparently politicized pardons during his first term \u2014 is risible. Just on Saturday, for example, the president-elect announced that he had chosen Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of his daughter Ivanka, to serve as ambassador to Paris. Trump had pardoned him for tax evasion, one count of retaliating against a federal witness \u2014 Kushner\u2019s brother-in-law \u2014 and another count of lying to the Federal Election Commission.Trump also issued pardons to other associates and people well connected with his family and his inner circle, including longtime fixer Roger Stone and 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Massad Boulos listens as Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign office on Friday, October 18, 2024, in Hamtramck, Michigan.Evan Vucci/APRelated articleTrump\u2019s extraordinary selection of his daughters\u2019 fathers-in-law for key posts underscores his reliance on family membersThe most recent cloud of politicization surrounding the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation dates to 2016 and then-FBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision to reopen an investigation into Democratic nomineeHillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email serverjust days before the election. Many Democrats blame his move for Clinton\u2019s defeat and have never regained their faith in the bureau.Then, the investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia soured many of the 45th president\u2019s supporters on the justice system. The probe culminated in theMueller report, which found that while the Trump campaign expected to benefit from Russian interference, there was no evidence to prove collusion.Trump\u2019s obsession with the FBI and the Justice Department, which produced his vows to enact retribution, only got worse when he was investigated and indicted over his election interference scheme and his hoarding of classified documents \u2014 both on the basis of voluminous and damaging evidence.If Trump responds to those who he claims weaponized the system against him with further weaponization, it could leave faith in the system irretrievably damaged in the eyes of millions of Americans for decades to come.This story has been updated with additional reporting."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Biden\u2019s pardon of his son makes presidential history", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/politics/joe-biden-presidential-history-pardon/index.html", "content": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s What Matters newsletter.

The federal investigation into Hunter Biden has been a yearslong event; it began in 2018 during the Trump presidency and continued throughout Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s administration. With the pardon, Biden broke a clear public promise not to interfere with the justice system on his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s behalf, something that will now stain his presidential legacy.Only two other presidents have pardoned family members, according to Alexis Coe, author of \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00f1\u222b Bill Clintonpardoned his half-brother Rogerfor drug charges.\u201a\u00f1\u222b Trumppardoned his son-in-law\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s father, Charles Kushner, who had been convicted of witness tampering, tax evasion and illegal campaign contributions.

Bannon later was convicted andserved time in jailon separate federal charges related to his refusal to comply with a congressional subpoena. He alsofaces state chargesrelated to the alleged private border wall scheme.Now the debate over presidents and justice will pivot from the fact that Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s election erased many of his legal problems to Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to erase his own son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s legal woes after Democrats\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 devastating loss.

We shall see in time. Meanwhile, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s worth looking at why Trump can impose these tariffs without input from Congress.This is not what the Constitution envisionedAfter all, the Constitution specifically gives Congress, not the president, the power to \u201a\u00c4\u00faregulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9How does Trump have the power to impose tariffs without any input from Congress? It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pretty much the opposite of what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s in the Constitution, and it didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t happen right away.For insight, I talked to Doug Irwin, an economics professor at Dartmouth College and the author of multiple books about tariffs and trade policy, including \u201a\u00c4\u00faTrade Policy Disaster: Lessons from the 1930s.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Smoot-Hawley tariffs exacerbated the Great DepressionIn the years after World War I, Congress had embraced isolationism and imposed tariffs on imports into the US as a way to protect US companies and workers from competition. As the Great Depression was beginning, Congress went back to this tool and imposed a law named for then-Sen. Reed Smoot of Utah and then-Rep. Willis Hawley of Oregon. The additional across-the-board tariffs in theSmoot-Hawley Actkicked off a trade war that exacerbated the Great Depression.After Franklin D. Roosevelt took office along with a Democratic majority, lawmakers corrected in the other direction. In 1934, they passed theReciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which gave the president power to lower import duties for countries with which the US had trade agreements.In the 1960s, presidents got power from Congress to impose tariffs for national security reasons, something Trump made use of during his first term when dealing with China, Europe, Canada and Mexico.Irwin said it could take some time for Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Commerce Department to conduct that investigation and determine there is a national security threat from Canada and Mexico, but it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also possible Trump could try to sidestep such a report.In the 1970s, Congress gave the president new trade promotion authority power to negotiate trade agreements and then have Congress ratify them without amendment. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s something lawmakers have granted at key moments in the years since,including in 2015, when a much more free trade-oriented GOP gave then-President Barack Obama authority to negotiate with a group of countries in the Pacific region.Trump later killed that deal, but heused the fast-track authorityto negotiate the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement he may now violate with new tariffs.Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s tariffsFor tariffs, Trump has instead focused on that1962 law, which requires a report from his administration justifying tariffs as a national security matter but does not require a vote by Congress.

While votes are still being added to the totals in some states, changes at this point would be marginal.Most of Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 drop-off came in populous states like California, New York and Florida, where a dip in support for Harris did not affect the Electoral College vote tally. Trump boosted his overall count in those population centers as well, padding his count by hundreds of thousands of votes in Texas, Florida and New York and to a lesser extent in traditional Democratic strongholds like New Jersey and Massachusetts.Zooming in on the hotly contested battleground states where the election was much closer, Harris and Trump both gained votes compared with 2020 in Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada. The population has also grown in all of those states in the past four years.Arizona\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s population has also grown, though the total number of votes cast in the state held about even. Harris got fewer votes there compared with Biden in 2020, and Trump carried it with his largest margin of victory across the seven battlegrounds.Pennsylvania and Michigan are battleground states where the population has not grown in the past four years and where Harris got fewer votes in 2024 than Biden got in 2020.Democrats lamenting the results have pointed out that the election was decided by about 230,000 votesin Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, battleground states won narrowly by Trump. But Harris lost votes compared with Biden across the country.Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 losses compared with Biden were biggest in Southern California, southern Florida and in the Northeast. The few places where Harris got more votes than Biden were largelyconcentrated in those seven battleground states, in particular Georgia and North Carolina, but it wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t enough to overcome Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gains. The only state where Harris gained votes on Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2020 performance, that was not also a battleground state, was Utah.Trump made gainsacross the seven battleground states in particular, but they weren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t limited to places with higher turnout. Trump also saw increases in support in a range of counties where fewer votes were cast overall.In Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, even in many counties where more people voted in 2024, Harris got fewer votes than Biden in 2020, although there were pockets in the swing states where Harris got more votes than Biden.Perhaps it shouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be surprising that in the states where the campaign was the most hotly contested, more people voted in 2024, whereas in states where one side or the other seemed more likely to win, turnout generallydropped."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump\u2019s trade threats put the world on a precipice and may say a lot about his second term", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/27/politics/trump-trade-threat-second-term-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Global chaos delivered via social media is back.Between 2017 and 2021, Donald Trump had the world on a precipice, bracing for his next move, gaming out whether his bluster was a bluff, an overture to a deal or a break with history, as he sowed mayhem to push adversaries off balance.President-elect Donald Trump attends the America First Policy Institute gala at Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on November 14.Carlos Barria/ReutersRelated articleTrump tries to force other countries to negotiating table on immigration and trade with promise to hike tariffsThose days are here again, nearly eight weeks before his second term begins.The president-elect\u2019sonline threatsMonday of new trade wars with Canada, Mexico and China turned the United States back into an agent of instability, which can pitch a foreign friend or foe into a crisis in an instant.Trump said America\u2019s two Western Hemisphere neighbors would be punished if they didn\u2019t stop the flow of undocumented migration and fentanyl across their borders. And he demanded China stop shipments of the drug as well.His first major global brouhaha since winning reelection posed the following questions that will help define the character of his second term.Is Trump serious about massive tariff hikes that could increase prices for US consumers as soon as he begins a second presidency, which was won partly because voters were so frustrated with inflation and costs of housing and groceries?Or is the president-elect indulging his view that life and politics is one big real estate deal? And is he setting out an extreme position to create leverage for agreements that might be modest but polish his dealmaker\u2019s brand?There\u2019s a third possibility \u2014 that Trump feels liberated by his election victory and is determined to drive his America First project further than a first term in which his most volatile instincts were often restrained by establishment aides.Trump believes he has mandate for huge changeMany of Trump\u2019s voters deeply disdain the political, economic, trading and diplomatic systems that they believe have hurt them financially and serve US and global elites. They want their MAGA hero to tear them down, without much idea what would replace them.Trucks wait on a queue to cross to the US next to the border wall at the Otay commercial crossing port in Tijuana, Baja California state, Mexico on November 26, 2024. President-elect Trump said Monday he would impose a 25 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada as one of his first actions upon becoming US president in January.Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleTariff-happy presidents are not what the Constitution envisionedTrump could, therefore, simply be creating headlines to show supporters that he\u2019s already fighting for their interests. Or he could have something more sweeping in mind. The second path could take America and the world into risky territory. The idea that he might go for broke could drag the US into trade wars that wreck the economy and spark dangerous standoffs in a world that is far more volatile since he left office four years ago.\u201cThere are plenty of examples (of) Trump\u2019s verbal threats forcing and compelling action on the part of other parties, particularly when it comes to foreign countries,\u201d Pete Seat, a former spokesman in President George W. Bush\u2019s White House, said on \u201cCNN News Central\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cThe real question is what will happen in these next two months?\u201d If all three nations make meaningful moves, Seat said, \u201cTrump may back off on this. Otherwise, we\u2019re all going to see price increases.\u201dThe issue of whether Trump is bluffing or is planning to go all in with a revolutionary presidency is not confined to trade.He has ambitious plans to gut the federal government with a new effort co-chaired by Elon Musk. But going all in would cause huge political and economic disruption that might backfire. Similarly, Trump vowed a mass deportation of up to 10 million undocumented migrants. But such an operation that would cost billions of dollars could buckle the agricultural sector and would also come with high political costs. This equation is mirrored abroad. Some in the West fear Trump will pull the US out of NATO or refuse to defend an alliance member attacked by Russia. Would the president-elect really blow apart the most successful military alliance in history \u2014 or is he just trying to wring more defense spending from some of Europe\u2019s lagging powers?In other words, does Trump have in mind a presidency driven by spectacle and brinkmanship that succeeds, like his first, in delivering mostly incremental change? Or is he really, as some of his fans want, trying to tear everything down?Video Ad FeedbackEnten explains how Americans view tariffs01:33- Source:CNNA quick startTrump\u2019s sudden warning on Monday of 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, with a further 10% hike above existing tariffs on Chinese goods, was the latest sign that the president-elect plans to quickly throw his muscle around.It caused a scramble in Ottawa, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jumped on the phone with Trump for what he insisted was a \u201cgood call.\u201d Within hours, Trump had got the attention of new Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, as she warned of like-for-like retaliation of Trump tariffs after January 20.The president-elect\u2019s gambit has created an immediate yard stick to judge whether his second presidency will be an attempt to push through far deeper disruption.There\u2019s no guarantee that Canada, Mexico and China will back down immediately.Still, deaths from overdoses of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are falling. And Trump\u2019s promises to impose hardline immigration policies are likely to deter many migrants from approaching the US southern border. Therefore, Trump could create an illusion of change to cover a decision to back down if he needs to.Trump\u2019s trade war rhetoric is a reminder that in his worldview, the United States has few friends \u2014 only adversaries against whom it can choose to win or lose. According to this view, it\u2019s fine for a big powerful country like the US to use its natural advantages to push around smaller neighbors, even if they are allies.But Trump must also size up his opponents both north and south of the border.Trudeau is politically weakened, and his Liberals are in danger of losing a general election due next year to Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre. The prime minister therefore has a huge incentive to avoid a trade war that could cause havoc in the Canadian economy. Both Canada and Mexico are dependent on their trade with the United States because of their geographical realities and may have no choice but to make concessions. But Sheinbaum is new in office, has plenty of political capital and may be keen to stand up to perceived bullying by a new US president.The case of China is distinct from Trump\u2019s threats to Canada and Mexico. The president-elect significantly stiffened policy toward America\u2019s new superpower rival in his first term. A trade war led to a deal, which again Trump hailed, but that largely dissolved during the pandemic and after China declined to buy the vast quantities of agricultural goods that the then-president said it would.Trade is only one source of friction between Washington and Beijing, and many of Trump\u2019s team \u2014 including Sen. Marco Rubio, his pick for secretary of state \u2014 believe that China poses an existential security and economic threat to the United States. This then could be the first salvo in a large and more intense period of confrontation across the Pacific rather  than merely a ruse to draw President Xi Jinping to the table.Other tensions are inevitableTrump\u2019s early turn against his neighbors will put other allies on notice \u2014 especially in Europe, where leaders are bracing for their own trade showdown with Trump, as well as dealing with tensions over how to end the war in Ukraine.Initial reaction to Trump\u2019s broadside against Canada and Mexico suggests that many observers see his outburst as a negotiating tactic. A Trump transition officialtold CNNon Tuesday, \u201cWe know what works.\u201d In his first term, Trump used the threat of a trade war to force Canada and Mexico to the table to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement was touted by Trump as a triumph \u2014 but it didn\u2019t fundamentally reshape the global economy or significantly improve a hollowed-out US industrial base that Trump pledged to revive in his 2016 and 2024 campaigns.It\u2019s a measure of his desire to foment discord that Trump is effectively threatening to tear up one of his own first-term achievements.\u201cWhat Donald Trump is proposing as an alpha-disrupter is to disrupt the largest trade market in the world,\u201d Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat, told CNN on Tuesday.Is he serious?Thanks to Trump\u2019s early setting of expectations, the world will soon find out."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Why green investments have become the last line of defense for Biden\u2019s climate agenda", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/26/politics/green-investments-red-states-biden-trump-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Can the green shoots of clean energy break through the \u201cbrown blockade\u201d?The brown blockadeis the phrase I\u2019ve used to describe the hardening tendency of the states most deeply integrated into the existing oil and gas economy, as either major producers or consumers of fossil fuels, to support Republican presidential and congressional candidates who are resolutely opposed to federal action to combat climate change.Those states moved sharply towardDonald Trumpand the GOP in this month\u2019s election. The president-elect won a stunning 26 of the 27 states whose economies are the most reliant on the fossil fuels that produce the carbon emissions driving global climate change. Each of the GOP\u2019s four Senate pickups also came in those higher-carbon states.In the campaign, Trump promised to take a wrecking ball to virtually all of PresidentJoe Biden\u2019s efforts aimed at reducing carbon emissions and accelerating the shift from fossil fuels to lower-carbon alternatives. The critical role that the states most tightly bound into the existing fossil fuel economy played in both Trump\u2019s victory and the GOP\u2019s success in recapturing the Senate, will only encourage him in that direction.CNNRelated articleIt\u2019s not just Democrats \u2014 Republicans are working to Trump-proof their climate moneyThe only dynamic that might complicate that offensive, even at the margins, may be the green shoots sprouting across large swathes of red America. This torrent of new investments in wind and solar power, the semiconductors used in clean energy, and especially electric vehicles and their batteries \u2013 triggered by the Inflation Reduction Act and other economic development bills signed by Biden \u2013 has flowed disproportionately into Republican-held states and congressional districts.Those huge current and planned investments in new manufacturing plants may represent the sole opportunity to preserve any elements of Biden\u2019s blueprint for growing the domestic clean energy industry.\u201cThe beauty of the Inflation Reduction Act is that there is a built-in defense system,\u201d said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, an environmental advocacy group. \u201cTo pull a quote from the \u201990s, \u2018It\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u2019 There\u2019s hundreds of thousands of new jobs that have been created. Manufacturing is back in the United States. There\u2019s nothing ideological about those jobs. Many of those clean energy workers voted for Trump, I have no doubt.\u201dThe relationship between fossil fuels and red statesAs I\u2019ve written before, the broadest measure of states\u2019 integration into the fossil fuel economy is theanalysis by the federal Energy Information Administrationof how much carbon each state emits in its energy consumption for each dollar of economic output that it produces. The top of that list is centered on two groups of states. One consists of the large producers of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas (including Wyoming, Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, Alaska, Montana, Oklahoma and Texas); the other big group is states that are large consumers of fossil fuels because they have either robust agricultural sectors (such as Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas) or big manufacturing industries (such as Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin). Whether as consumers or producers, the high-carbon states are predominantly located in the center of the country.The states that emit the least carbon per dollar of economic output are mostly coastal states that produce little oil, gas or coal and have transitioned more rapidly into the post-industrial economy of services and high-tech jobs, such as Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, Maryland, Washington, Oregon and California (which does produce some natural gas).Throughout the 21st century, the high-carbon states have become the foundation of the GOP\u2019s geographical strength in both the Senate and the Electoral College.The Republican dominance of those states dramatically solidified in 2024.After the 2024 election, Republicans now hold 37 of the 40 Senate seats in the 20 states that emit the most carbon per dollar of economic activity, per the Energy Information Administration. That\u2019s up substantially from the GOP\u2019s control of 32 of the 40 seats from the highest-emitting states after Trump\u2019s first election in 2016.Three of the Senate seats Republicans this year flipped from Democratic control rank in the top 20 highest-emitting states: West Virginia, Montana and Ohio, all of which have trended sharply toward the GOP over roughly the past 15 years. The fourth Democratic-held Senate seat Republicans captured was in the battleground of Pennsylvania, which ranks 27thin emissions per dollar of output, just above the national average.Across those 27 states with the highest carbon intensity in their economies, Republicans now control 48 of the 54 Senate seats. (The only Democratic senators in those states are two each in New Mexico and Michigan, as well as Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and John Fetterman in Pennsylvania.)The partisan balance is almost inverted in the remaining 23 states with the lowest level of carbon emissions per dollar of output: Democrats hold 41 of those 46 Senate seats, and Republicans just five. The two parties thus present an almost mirror image across this carbon divide: Ninety-one percent of all Republican senators come from the high-carbon states, while 87% of Democratic senators are elected by the lower-carbon states.The presidential race tells the same story. Among the 27 states with the highest level of carbon emissions per dollar of economic output, Trump lost only New Mexico. That restored the president-elect\u2019s dominance of the high-carbon states to its level in 2016 (when he also won 26 of the 27 highest-emitting states) after Biden held Trump to just 23 of the top 27 states in 2020.The three former \u201cblue wall\u201d Rust Beltstates that Trump recaptured in 2024 \u2013 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 all rank among those higher-emitting states.As in the Senate, Democrats dominate the lower-emitting states: Kamala Harris won 18 of the 23 on the bottom of the list, including all 11 states with the absolute lowest level of emissions.The politics of energy isn\u2019t necessarily the decisive factor in determining the partisan tilt of most of these states. The high-carbon states also usually have other characteristics that lean them toward the GOP. Most, for instance, have fewer racial minorities, immigrants and college-educated information-economy workers than the national average and more evangelical Christians and rural residents. The low-carbon states present the opposite picture on all of those dimensions.But whether or not energy policy is the principalcauseof the electoral divergence between high- and low-carbon states, theeffectis unmistakable. The low-carbon states tend to elect Democrats who back measures to advance the transition to a low-carbon energy supply and combat climate change. The high-carbon states overwhelmingly vote for Republicans who back expanded domestic production of oil and gas and who resolutely oppose federal action to reduce carbon emissions. That nearly indivisible phalanx of Republicans constitutes the\u201cbrown blockade\u201din Washington.Campaign contribution trends reinforce this pattern. As the debate over whether to respond to climate change has intensified over the past quarter-century, the oil and gas industry has shifted its giving almost entirely toward Republicans. In 1990, oil and gas interests split their political contributions about 2-to-1 toward the GOP. But in the last few election cycles, the oil industry has directed nearly 9 in 10 of its campaign dollars toward Republicans,according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign contributions and spending.Trumphas been especially close to midsize oil companiesthat remain focused almost entirely on drilling for oil and gas, as opposed to the multinational oil giants, such as ExxonMobil or Chevon, that have diversified more into lower-carbon energy sources. Chris Wright, Trump\u2019snominee for energy secretary, runs a company focused on fracking for natural gasand has flatly declared, \u201cThere is no \u2018climate crisis,\u2019\u201d and \u201cthe only thing resembling a crisis \u2026 is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.\u201dThese factors virtually ensure Trump will move to undo many Biden policiesopposed by the oil and gas industry. Trump, for instance, is likely to quickly begin the process of rescinding regulations the Environmental Protection Agency approved under Biden requiring auto companies and electric utilities to reduce their carbon emissions (by selling more electric vehicles and deploying more clean power, respectively). (Lee Zeldin, Trump\u2019s nominee to run the EPA,has saidhis priority for \u201cDay 1 and the first 100 days\u201d will be \u201cto roll back regulations.\u201d) And Trump will likely move rapidly to end theBiden administration\u2019s hold on exports of liquified natural gasand to make more public lands, both on- and offshore, available for oil and gas drilling.What will Trump do to clean energy?But while Trump is certain to take wide-ranging steps toboostthe oil and gas industry, it\u2019s an open question how far he will go to alsohobbleits competitors in the emerging clean energy space.Revoking the Biden EPA regulations for clean cars and electricity will hurt alternative energy producers by reducing demand. But, experts agree, the biggest blow Trump could strike against the growing clean energy industries would be to repeal the interconnected tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act that promote both the production and consumption of low-carbon alternatives.As Congress considers the future of those incentives, the growing importance of clean energy industries in Republican-leaning states and congressional districts could complicate the political equation for GOP lawmakers, even those who represent high-carbon states.An exclusive recent CNN analysis of datafrom the nonpartisan Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for instance, found that nearly four-fifths of the $243 billion in clean energy projects that are either completed or under construction are sited in GOP-held congressional districts. Republican districts are slated to receive an equally large share of another $435 billion in clean energy projects that have been announced but not yet built, the analysis found.A solar farm built by Rosendin Electric is seen on August 14, 2024, in Liverpool, Texas.Elizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle/Getty ImagesIn another recent analysis, Climate Power found Trump won 9 of the 10 states that since passage of the IRA have received the most new investment in manufacturing facilities for clean energy and semiconductors associated with those projects. (New York was the only exception.) Trump also won 7 of the 10 states that have seen the most new jobs created in those sectors since passage of the IRA, the analysis found. Eight of the states that rank in the top 10 for either new clean energy jobs or investment are also among the top 25 states that now emit the most carbon.If Trump and Congress repeal the IRA tax credits, \u201cI would expect to see announced manufacturing facilities \u2013 which are disproportionately [located] in Republican districts \u2013fold up,\u201d said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a group that works to unite environmentalists and labor unions. \u201cThese are not manufacturers who have economies of scale producing in this country yet. The idea was to give them a glide path with multiyear tax incentives, via the IRA. If that goes away, I think many of those facilities, if not most of them, go away.\u201dLodes noted that not only are most of the new clean energy investments flowing into red states, butresearch showsthat the new manufacturing plants are disproportionately sitting in economically distressed exurban and rural communities within those states. \u201cAre they really going to want to turn their backs on communities in their states that have been brought back?\u201d she asked. Moreover, she noted, given that Trump has committed to reducing Americans\u2019 energy costs, will he and GOP legislators \u201cwant to take energy off the board, which will just increase people\u2019s cost,\u201d by revoking the IRA subsidies triggering the clean energy manufacturing boom?Robert McNally, a Republican energy consultant who served as a White House adviser to President George W. Bush, believes the answer to Lodes\u2019 question will be a simple yes. He\u2019s dubious GOP legislators will fight to preserve many of the new IRA provisions beyond those benefiting a few energy options Republicans favor, such as nuclear power and carbon capture. Republicans, he believe, will also likely try to preserve some longer-standing incentives, like federal support for ethanol production.Beyond that, though, the sweeping new IRA incentives for producers and consumers of electric vehicles and solar and wind \u201cjust don\u2019t have deep roots,\u201d among Republicans, McNally said. The idea that auto companies \u201care building battery factories in, say, Georgia so therefore [Republicans from Georgia] will fight repeal of the IRA incentives \u2013 I don\u2019t see any sign of that.\u201dA Hyundai electric vehicle assembly and battery plant under construction in Ellabell, Georgia, September 9, 2023.Bloomberg/Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesCertainly Republicans have shown nothing but skepticism about the IRA so far. No Republican in either the House or Senate voted for the law when it passed Congress in 2022. After the GOP recaptured the House in 2023,every Republican representative votedto repeal it \u2013 even those whose districts were among the biggest beneficiaries of the new clean energy jobs and investments tied to the law.Still, environmentalists took heartfrom a letter 18 Republican House membersreleased in August expressing opposition to repealing the IRA\u2019s incentives for building new manufacturing plants \u2013 what they considered to be the first sign that the new jobs and investments might be softening ideological resistance to the law.Walsh said that in a stand-alone vote on the IRA\u2019s future, enough House Republicans might resist full repeal to protect the law \u2013 especially given the GOP\u2019s narrow majority.\u201cThe challenge we\u2019re facing is Trump and the GOP leadership in Congress is not going to present members with a simple up or down vote,\u201d Walsh said. Instead, he predicts, the administration will push to repeal key IRA provisions to partly offset the cost for \u201cthe trillions of dollars in tax cuts that is the highest priority for Trump and the GOP to pass. So in that context, which I\u2019m sure is the context we will face,the pressure on Republican lawmakers to redistribute money up to the wealthiest Americans is going to be enormous. And that will make the fight a hell of a lot harder.\u201dNo matter what happens to the IRA, experts agree that EVs and low-carbon power sources such as wind and solar will continue to expand their foothold because of technological advances and economic efficiencies.\u201cElectric vehicles are not Betamax,\u201d said University of California at Berkeley economist Joseph Shapiro, referring to a 1980s technology for recording television programs that was eclipsed by rival products. \u201cThis is not a technology that if it doesn\u2019t get a big (government) push it won\u2019t be adopted.\u201dFILE - California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks during a press conference in Los Angeles, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Thayer, File)Eric Thayer/APRelated articleCalifornia could keep the $7,500 EV credit alive if Trump kills the cost-saving measure, Newsom saysStill, Shapiro and others agree that government policy can enormously influence the pace of the transition from fossil fuels.In a recent paper, he and several colleagues calculated that repealing the IRA\u2019s $7,500 tax credit for purchasing a new electric vehicle, as Trump has pledged to do, would reduce the sales of new EVs by 27%. Domestically assembled EVs would suffer an even greater 37% decline, they forecast, because of the law\u2019s provisions benefiting vehicles built in the US.That\u2019s only one example of how the energy decisions made over the next four years could reverberate for decades. The US reliance on the fossil fuels driving climate change has been declining for years, but only at a modest pace. In 2000, fossil fuels provided 88% of the nation\u2019s energy,according to the Energy Information Administration; in 2023, the latest year for which figures are available, that number was 82.5%.Biden\u2019s agendawould unquestionably accelerate that change:The Rhodium Group has projectedthat if current policies remain in place, carbon-free sources within the next decade would provide three-fourths of the nation\u2019s electricity, while electric vehicles would comprise two-thirds to three-fourths of new car sales. In all, the group forecasts that under Biden\u2019s policies, fossil fuels over the next decade would fall to anywhere from 75% to as little as 58% of the nation\u2019s energy mix, according to Ben King, an associate director of Rhodium\u2019s climate and energy practice. That\u2019s a much faster pace of decline than in the past quarter-century.Even in that world, King notes, oil and gas producers are hardly facing an existential threat to their business in any medium-term time frame. \u201cIt is a more gradual energy transition than people initially think,\u201d King said.Yet interrupting that transition by repealing the federal policies benefiting clean energy remains a dangerous gamble. The result could be a vicious downward cycle: less investment in lower-carbon energy alternatives, which means less production, which yields fewer gains from advances in technology and manufacturing efficiency, which means less adoption, which translates into further reductions in clean energy investment and more years with fossil fuels entrenched as the nation\u2019s predominant energy source.All of that, in turn, would ensure years of greater carbon emissions \u2013 with ominous implications for extreme weather and other manifestations of climate change.\u201cIf the world adopts EVs in 2060 rather than 2020, it makes a giant difference for the planet because there is 40 years of burning gasoline rather than using a cleaner grid,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cSo the pace of adoption matters even if we end up at the same place in the end.\u201dThe brown blockade in Washington can\u2019t entirely stop the shift from fossil fuels to a low-carbon energy future \u2013 but, as the first months of Trump\u2019s second term may quickly demonstrate, it can significantly slow the change, and raise the cost of delay."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump\u2019s evasion of January 6 accountability will echo for next four years and generations to come", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/26/politics/trump-jack-smith-january-6-accountability-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Special counsel Jack Smith set out to prove in the United States of America v.

Ironically, the very democracy that Trump had tried to subvert produced his legal deliverance.The cases were doomed anyway since Trump vowed to fire Smith as soon as he takes office.But Smith\u2019s move on Monday validated Trump\u2019s high-wire legal and political strategy, which involved repeated delays, sometimes with the help of conservative judges, and an absolute imperative to win the presidential election \u2014 a feat that looked unlikely when he was first charged.Special counsel Jack Smith delivers remarks on a recently unsealed indictment including four felony counts against Donald Trump in Washington, DC, on August 1, 2023.Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesWhat the thwarting of accountability meansThere will be short- and long-term consequences from Trump escaping accountability.His second term, which he already pledged to devote to \u201cretribution,\u201d has the potential to unfold in an even greater atmosphere of impunity than his first one.  After all, Trump enters office for the second time having seen that his method of testing the rule of law to its limits had little downside, aside from the symbolism of his second impeachment by the US House.\u201cFor Donald Trump, his strategy of delay, delay, delay and then win the election to do away with the litigation, proves to be one of the ultimate success stories,\u201d James Sample, a law professor at Hofstra University, told Julia Chatterley on \u201cFirst Move\u201d on CNN International. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a win in terms of avoiding accountability, which means it is a loss for the rule of law that it took so long to bring these cases to trial that they never in fact got to trial before the election.\u201dSmith\u2019s inability to bring the president-elect to account \u2014 for the most flagrant attack on the integrity of elections of modern times \u2014 will also echo down the ages.Many Republicans are convinced by now that Trump was unfairly targeted. But some future president, decades from now, might decide to meddle in the result of an election that they lost in the knowledge that a predecessor got away with it.Smith\u2019s gamble has failedIn Washington, Judge Tanya Chutkan, who was set to preside over the political trial of the century in the federal election interference case, quickly agreed to Smith\u2019s request to dismiss the case without prejudice \u2014 meaning that theoretically Trump could face the same charges again when he leaves office. But the chances of a revival of the trial in four years are far-fetched, even if a Democrat is in the White House.The folding of the federal prosecutions also poses searching questions for Smith and the Justice Department.Democrats have long complained that Attorney General Merrick Garland waited too long to appoint a special counsel to investigate Trump for his election meddling in 2020. After all, a congressional select committee under the previous Democratic House majority spent months probing the issue. The case might have come to trial had Garland moved more quickly. Certainly, there would have been more time for Supreme Court appeals to play out that Democrats thought were tainted by politicized delaying tactics by the conservative majority.There has all along been another profound consideration hanging over the case. Despite the horror of what unfolded on January 6, 2021, and the shock of a president using his vast powers to try to steal an election he lost, a decision to prosecute was always going to rock the nation and its tortured politics.Smith followed the evidence where he thought it led and secured indictments through grand juries who were convinced there was probable cause that criminal activity had occurred in both cases. That is standard prosecutorial practice.But even some legal scholars sympathetic to the idea that Trump should face accountability for trying to overturn an election wondered whether the legal theories on which Smith relied were somewhat novel. But how could they not be? No president before dared to do what Trump tried.And the business of putting a former president on trial was always going to raise a more acute dilemma: Was it really in the national interest to try to bring a former commander in chief into a courtroom trial, given the tumult such a crossing of the historic Rubicon was always destined to cause?At the same time, however, failing to act against an attempt to steal an election and the alleged unauthorized storage of classified documents would have enshrined an un-American principle that presidents can break the law but every other citizen cannot.It was not Smith\u2019s job to consider the political implications of his indictments. But charging Trump in two separate cases ahead of the election year, when the ex-president was already a candidate, was always going to stoke partisan uproar. There\u2019s a good argument that this course revived Trump\u2019s political career.The impact of the two federal cases \u2014 and two other prosecutions in a hush money case in New York, in which Trump was convicted, and another election interference matter in Georgia that is still awaiting trial \u2014 was to unify the Republican Party around Trump in the primary. By the general election, millions of Republican voters bought his argument that he was not only innocent but was effectively a dissident persecuted by a weaponized justice system. \u201cI\u2019m being indicted for you,\u201d he had said.Donald Trump appears in court for his hush money trial at Manhattan Criminal Court on May 30, in New York City.Steven Hirsch/Getty ImagesPerhaps Smith\u2019s cases would have been less politically radioactive had Trump not also faced multiple other cases. Trump\u2019s mug shot in the Georgia matter, for example, was a galvanizing moment for his supporters. And the spectacle of FBI agents searching his Florida club for classified documents provided a powerful image for a former president who declared he was unfairly prosecuted.The once-and-future president put the cap on his reality warping narrative that he was the victim, rather than the perpetrator, of election interference. \u201cIt was a political hijacking, and a low point in the History of our Country that such a thing could have happened, and yet, I persevered, against all odds, and WON. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.The Capitol will be the backdrop to Trump\u2019s validationFour years ago, a nation sickened by a once-in-a-century pandemic was being put through another ordeal because of one man\u2019s inability to face up to the fact that he lost the 2020 general election.So, it\u2019s worth going back to Smith\u2019s original indictment to recall the grave and unprecedented conduct that was charged in the election interference case and for which Trump will now almost certainly not be held accountable.\u201cThe Defendant lost the 2020 presidential election,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cDespite having lost, the Defendant was determined to remain in power. So, for more than two months following election day on November 3, 2020, the Defendant spread lies that there had been outcome-determinative fraud in the election and that he had actually won. These claims were false, and the Defendant knew that they were false. But the Defendant repeated and widely disseminated them anyway\u2014to make his knowingly false claims appear legitimate, create an intense national atmosphere of mistrust and anger, and erode public faith in the administration of the election.\u201dEven Trump\u2019s own Justice Department ruled that there was no meaningful fraud in the 2020 election that would have altered the result. Almost all of Trump\u2019s legal challenges failed, and Joe Biden was duly inaugurated, two weeks after his predecessor\u2019s crowd tried to halt the congressional certification of his victory.Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat who served as a lead counsel in Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial, said he understood why Smith had followed Justice Department guidance. But he also portrayed Trump\u2019s evasion of a trial as a dark day for America. \u201cI think this is a shame for justice in this country. It establishes that Donald Trump is above the law,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Boris Sanchez.Trump will prove that assessment in less than two months on the West Front of the Capitol, when he swears to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States\u201d on the ground over which his mob swarmed on January 6, 2021."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump\u2019s determination to install controversial picks faces next test", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/25/politics/trump-gabbard-hegseth-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Donald Trump\u2019s Senate allies are racing to defend Tulsi Gabbard, his pick to lead US intelligence services, in what could become the next test of the president-elect\u2019s bid to install provocative nominees \u2014 and of any Republican appetite to stop him.Gabbard and another contentious Trump pick \u2014 Pete Hegseth, who has been tapped to lead the Defense Department \u2014 came under sharpened scrutiny Sunday as the spotlightshifted from Matt Gaetz, Trump\u2019s toppled choice to be attorney general.Former President Donald Trump gives the keynote address at Turning Point Action's \"The People's Convention\" on June 15, 2024 in Detroit, Michigan.Bill Pugliano/Getty ImagesRelated articleTracking Trump\u2019s picks for his Cabinet and administrationSpeaking on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth warned of Gabbard: \u201cI think she\u2019s compromised.\u201d The Illinois senator brought up Gabbard\u2019s visit to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2017 andpolicy positionswhere she\u2019s appeared to mirror Russian propaganda talking points.But Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin, speaking to Dana Bash on the same show, said such claims were \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201coutright dangerous\u201d and called for Duckworth to retract them.The extraordinary public debate over whether a president-elect\u2019s pick to oversee US intelligence agencies is a compromised asset is a taste of the massive upheaval that likely awaits next year in his second term.Key questions as Thanksgiving week opensBut it\u2019s far from the only question that Trump\u2019s political comeback has sent swirling around Washington heading into the Thanksgiving holiday this week.Trump\u2019s pick of Hegseth is also facing uncertainty after the release last week of a2017 police reportdetailing an alleged sexual assault in California. The former Fox News anchor says the encounter with a woman in California was consensual. He denies wrongdoing and was not charged.One big unknown is whether Republican senators are again prepared to challenge Trump\u2019s judgment after it quickly became clear that Gaetz wouldn\u2019t have enough of their votes to be confirmed amid his ownsexual misconduct allegations, which he denies. One theory is that the incoming GOP majority won\u2019t simply be a rubber stamp for an all-powerful president. But the withdrawal of Gaetz \u2014 who was already widely disliked in Congress \u2014 may leave senators feeling they owe the president-elect on his other highly controversial choices.Trump\u2019snew selection for attorney general, Pam Bondi, is meanwhile being welcomed by many Republicans, suggesting she\u2019ll have an easier path to confirmation than Gaetz. But the former Florida attorney general\u2019spast vowthat \u201cprosecutors will be prosecuted\u201d raised expectations that the president-elect plans to press ahead with his promise to use the powers of the Justice Department to seek retribution on those who have investigated him, including over his attempt to steal the 2020 election.A sense that the president-elect is deeply serious about his vow to gut government was bolstered by thechoice on Friday night of Russell Voughtto again lead the Office of Management and Budget. Vought was one of the key authors of Project 2025 \u2014 the conservative blueprint disavowed by Trump on the campaign trail that involved a defenestrating of the bureaucracy. Trump has already tasked Tesla pioneer Elon Musk and former GOP primary candidate Vivek Ramaswamy withdrawing up massive government cuts.With most of Trump\u2019s top picks complete, pending official nomination and confirmation, attention is turning to what impact a planned policy blitz and his power-flexing could have inside the US and around the world. For instance, while opting for massive disruption in some areas, several of his economic picks have the ear of Wall Street, including hedge fund managerScott Bessent for Treasuryand Howard Lutnick, the head of financial services giant Cantor Fitzgerald, forCommerce secretary. They\u2019ll likely have the job of easing fears in the markets about Trump\u2019s planned tariff hikes, which are designed to hurt foreign trading competitors but could spike inflation andharm American consumers.After a week of alarming escalations in the war in Ukraine, Trump\u2019s vow to end the fighting is now becoming one of thefirst big foreign policy testsof his new term. His incoming national security adviser,Rep. Mike Waltz, asked on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d \u201cWhere is this escalation going?\u201d The Florida Republican added that the conflict had degenerated into World War I trench warfare and that Trump was \u201cincredibly concerned about the carnage that is taking place there. And \u2026 how do we restore deterrence and how do we bring peace?\u201d Trump has vowed to end the war quickly, but there are fears in Ukraine that he\u2019ll do a deal that validates Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s illegal invasion of a sovereign democracy by letting Moscow keep vast swathes of territory it seized.The pace of Trump\u2019s staff rollout and the ideology of his picks suggest a political whirlwind will hit the capital when he is sworn in on January 20. But after Trump won the Electoral College and the popular vote, Republicans \u2014 who won control of both the Senate and the House \u2014 are insisting he has authority for sweeping change. Still, Trump\u2019s apparent determination to use power to satisfy personal vengeance raises the issue of whether his administration will be sufficiently focused to perform the radical reinvention of government he\u2019s promising. And after an election that turned partly on the question of voters\u2019 economic insecurities, is the president-elect about to attempt the kind of overreach that often trips up presidents who think they have a mandate?Gabbard looms as next confirmation controversyThe selection of Gabbard to be director of national intelligence encapsulates Trump\u2019s deep mistrust of intelligence agencies that he is convinced conspired against him over the Russia investigation in his first term.Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, has very little experience working with high-level intelligence. And she has taken positions that are opposite to those of the US espionage community. She defended Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, who were behind two of the biggest US national security leaks of the 21st century. She also made arguments about the wars in Ukraine and Syria that appeared closer to the foreign policy positions of the Russian government than the American one.John Lamparski/Getty Images/FileRelated articleSenators bracing for confirmation battles over unorthodox Trump Cabinet picksAndCNN reportedFriday that Gabbard had once been placed on a Transportation Security Administration watchlist \u2014 which, even if it was for benign reasons, would be highly unusual for a nominee for a top position.The 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate has now embraced Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d philosophy. Democrats seem to see her selection as vulnerable, or at least as a chance to make Trump pay a political price for choosing her, as they seek traction after a disastrous election.Duckworth, who said there were questions about whether Gabbard was a Russian asset, added: \u201cI do think that we have a real deep concern whether or not she\u2019s a compromised person. \u2026 The US intelligence community has identified her as having troubling relationships with America\u2019s foes. And so, my worry is that she couldn\u2019t pass a background check.\u201dSen.-elect Adam Schiff of California, who served on the House Intelligence Committee until GOP leadership kicked him off last year, also criticized Gabbard\u2019s nomination, describing her Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d as \u201csomeone with very questionable judgment and no experience,\u201d while also raising her visit to Syria.But Mullin, who had raised questions about the Gaetz selection, forcibly defended Gabbard from Duckworth. \u201cFor her to say ridiculous and outright dangerous words like that is wrong,\u201d the Oklahoma Republican said on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d He said Gabbard \u201ccommands a Reserve unit here in Oklahoma and Missouri.

The president-elect has long argued the bureau plotted against him, especially afterhis indictmentsfor hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort after he left office and over his attempt to stay in power despite losing the 2020 election.One potential new FBI director is Kash Patel, one of Trump\u2019s most outspoken supporters, who was chief of staff to the former acting secretary of defense in the first term. Patel is regarded as one of the most vehement proponents of Trump\u2019s MAGA movement, but multiple sources familiar with the Trump transition process expressed deep concern at the possibility he could be nominated, CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins reported last week. A spot as FBI director would put Patel in position to investigate Trump\u2019s enemies and to purge career civil servants that he and the president-elect believe are part of a corrupt \u201cdeep state.\u201dOne option might be to pick someone easier to confirm for the top job and have Patel serve as deputy director, CNN reported last week.

I listen,\u201d Boyer said.Then his turn: \u201cWhy do you feel that way? Why would you vote for this guy? Why would you vote for an individual who I think is a racist who is a misogynist. \u2026 Who is with the January 6 situation?

Aita at first blames Trump\u2019s critics, but then agrees he, too, often stokes the fighting.\u201cI\u2019m saying both parties, both parties,\u201d she said. \u201cKnock it off. \u2026 Just let\u2019s all come together for this country. It\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t like the division and everything.\u201dMurphy can agree on that point.\u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is affecting every family, every friendship.\u201dBut the disagreement stirs again as Aita tries to wrap that point.\u201cWe have to just knock it off,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s president for four years.

You can\u2019t even get pizza delivered where we live.\u201dKellerton is in Ringgold County, along the Iowa-Missouri border. Trump won 75% of the county vote. Ebersole said the reasons why are straightforward.\u201cCare about all of us, don\u2019t prioritize small individual groups first,\u201d she said. \u201cWe felt as though Washington and the far edges of our country were governing the rest of middle America.\u201dEbersole wasn\u2019t as bullish about Trump at the outset of the presidential campaign. Yes, she voted for him in 2016 and 2020, but she supported former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the Iowa caucuses because while she approves of most Trump policies, she believed it important that Republicans find a new leader who could be both president and role model.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t as respectful as I think our president should be,\u201d Ebersole told us when we first met in December 2023. \u201cBecause he didn\u2019t bring us together. Because of the divisiveness. Because of my liberal friends who were literally scared for their safety.\u201dOnce Trump clinched the nomination, Ebersole said her choice was easy because of Biden-Harris administration farm and climate policies she says punish small operators like her family business. \u201cThose policies made it a no-brainer for me,\u201d Ebersole said. \u201cMy only reticence was wanting to bring us together.\u201dNow, with Trump preparing to return to the White House, Ebersole again stressed her hope for a less confrontational politics. But her tone about Trump and the sources of division is different.\u201cThey are still scared,\u201d she said of her liberal friends. \u201cThe fear tactics of the left make them more afraid of Trump. \u2026 The point that I would really tell my liberal friends to understand is just because we voted in a very conservative president, that means that we don\u2019t want to put rules on you either. We just care about our own liberties.\u201dEbersole is among the voters who participated in ourAll Over the Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters in key voting blocs or from key campaign battlegrounds. Iowa was our first stop, back when the first question of the 2024 campaign was whether Trump retained his grip on the GOP. We visited three times during the campaign, and then returned after the election to get a sense of what these Republican voters want and expect when Trump returns to the White House in January.Ebersole said she hopes the president-elect reads his mandate as an urgent call to focus on the economy and immigration.\u201cDeportation is necessary because we have allowed way too many undocumented people to come in,\u201d Ebersole said. \u201cBut we also need a path, a path for those people to become Americans.\u201dShe is an unabashed fan of Trump\u2019s call for tariffs on foreign products.\u201cWhy are we bringing Argentinian beef in?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy are we bringing in New Zealand and Australian beef in and then exporting some of our beef? Why don\u2019t we first just feed our beef to our Americans?\u201dAnd she hopes Trump looks at his victory in the popular vote and understands that voters like her want him to set aside the campaign talk about rooting out \u201cthe enemy within\u201d or seeking retribution. \u201cWe are not letting him be a bully, but we want him to stand firm,\u201d she said.After considering Biden, she\u2019s trusting TrumpLike Ebersole, Betsy Sarcone began the election cycle believing it was time for Republicans to move on from Trump.

Now, though, when asked about Trump\u2019s angry words at campaign rallies, she offered a different take.\u201cWhat I see is him being mad at an open border, being mad at the crime rates, being mad at the economy,\u201d Sarcone said. \u201cI\u2019m completely OK with that.\u201dHer priorities: lower interest rates to help her real estate business, and lower grocery prices. \u201cI\u2019m a mom, single mother of three kids,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that does make a huge difference in my life.\u201dShe does not have amnesia about Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cWhen Trump gets off track, off his train of thought, that\u2019s when we get in trouble.

Matt Gaetz for attorney general, have triggered eye rolls or worse.\u201cNot necessarily excited,\u201d Sarcone said. \u201cWorried? I wouldn\u2019t say I am worried. \u2026 I\u2019m just going to put my trust in him at this point.\u201dShe stays calm by remembering she could not vote for Harris.\u201cI voted for change, as did the majority of people, and that is what we are going to get,\u201d Sarcone said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think worrying about it every day is going to do me any good.\u201dExcited for Trump even if business takes a hitChris Mudd is a Team Trump original \u2014 going back to 2015.He owns Midwest Solar and his vote could hurt his business; the startup has benefited from Biden administration clean energy incentives.\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Mudd said of taking a hit if Trump ends those incentives. \u201cI sell value. I sell saving money, not selling the green energy side of the business.\u201dBut he urged Trump to go full speed ahead, including with tariffs that could raise prices on Chinese components he needs for some big solar installations.\u201cMost of our stuff is tariff free,\u201d Mudd said in an interview at his Waterloo office last week. \u201cSo, I want to see more products and services get built in this country.

I never mentioned doing that, never even thought about such a thing,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the former presidentposted on XThursday.Facts First:Trump is trying to rewrite history. Repealing and replacing the landmark health reform law, popularly known as Obamacare, was among his top campaign promises when he first ran for president in 2016, and he spent the initial months of his term pushing Congress to pass legislation to do just that. Trump revived the idea early in the current campaign before backtracking. At September\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presidential debate with Harris, he called the Affordable Care Act \u201a\u00c4\u00falousy\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and said \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are working on \u201a\u00c4\u00fathings\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to replace it.Even before he ran for office, Trump was crusading on Twitter, now known as X, to repeal the law signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama.Duringhis 2016 campaign, he promised supporters that he would quickly dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Within hours of taking office in January 2017, he issued anexecutive orderaimed at rolling back the law.After the GOP-led House of Representatives passed a repeal bill in May 2017, Trump called them to the White House for a celebratory appearance and said Obamacare was \u201a\u00c4\u00faessentially dead.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is a great plan. I actually think it will get even better. This is a repeal and replace of Obamacare. Make no mistake about it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trump said.However, even though Republicans controlled Congress and the White House that year, they\u00ac\u2020failed to unite\u00ac\u2020behind a plan to do so, ending any serious attempts to completely jettison the Affordable Care Act. Trump spent the rest of his termchipping awayat the law.The former president revived the debate over the law\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fate in November 2023, when he\u00ac\u2020wrote\u00ac\u2020on his Truth Social platform that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faseriously looking at alternatives\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and that the failure to terminate it \u201a\u00c4\u00fawas a low point for the Republican Party, but we should never give up!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Trump has recently tried to change his tack \u201a\u00c4\u00ec promising to come up with a health care plan that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s better.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat we will do is we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re looking at different plans,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trump said at September\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s debate, noting that he had \u201a\u00c4\u00faconcepts of a plan.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faIf we can come up with a plan that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to cost our people, our population, less money and be better health care than Obamacare, then I would absolutely do it.

He has both come up with new falsehoods on pressing issues, most notably the federal response to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, and repeated old favorites about subjects he has been railing about since his 2016 presidential campaign.We went through the speeches Trump made at his two Wednesday campaign rallies in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, one in Scranton and one in Reading. In those two addresses alone, he uttered at least 40 separate false claims.Here is a fact check.FEMA and migrants: Trumpfalsely claimedof the Federal Emergency Management Agency: \u201cThey have no money. You know where they gave the money? To illegal immigrants coming in.\u201d He alsosaid, \u201cThey spent all their funds; they have no funds to take care\u2026\u201dThis is false in two ways. FEMA doeshave moneyfor the immediate responses to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, though a string of recent disasters has depleted its disaster relief fund; the fundhad about $11 billionremaining as of Wednesday. And FEMAdid notgive all of its disaster relief money to undocumented people; rather, as mandated by Congress, FEMA also administers an entirely separate pool of money for sheltering migrants.FEMA and employees: Trump added another false claim about FEMA,saying: \u201cThey have no workers, they have no nothing.\u201d FEMA hasmore than 20,000 employees.Harris and the response: Trump falselyclaimedthat as desperate people tried to survive Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, Vice President Kamala Harris \u201cdidn\u2019t send anything or anyone at all\u201d to help them. There were extensive federal and state rescue and relief efforts in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Helene. It\u2019s true that some residents died and others were stranded for days, but the state was not ignored by Harris or the Biden administration; North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, has repeatedlythankedPresident Joe Biden for his assistance.Schools and transgender children: Trump told a slightly vaguer version of his usualfalse storyabout schools supposedly obtaining or performing gender-affirming surgeries for transgender children behind their parents\u2019 backs,saying, \u201cYour child go goes to school, and they take your child. It was a \u2018he.\u2019 And comes back a \u2018she.\u2019 And they do this\u2026And often without parental consent.\u201dThere is no evidence that US schools have sent children into gender-affirming surgeries without their parents knowing or performed gender-affirming surgeries on site; Trump\u2019s own presidential campaign could not provide a single example of any of this ever happening. Even in states wheregender-affirming surgeryis legal for people under age 18, parental consent\u00a0is required before a minor can undergo such a procedure.Trump\u2019s opponents and the election: In Reading, Trump falselyclaimedof his election opponents: \u201cThey are cheatin\u2019 dogs, I will tell you that.\u201d In Scranton, he falselyclaimed, \u201cTheir first meeting is: \u2018How do we cheat?\u2019\u201d This is all nonsense. There is no basis for the claim that Trump\u2019s opponents are election cheaters.Harris\u2019 previous presidential campaign: Trump repeated his falseclaimthat, when Harris ran for president in 2020, \u201cshe was the first one to drop out, of like 22 people\u201d in the Democratic primary. In fact, 13 other Democratic candidates dropped out of that primary before Harris exited in December 2019 \u2013 including\u00a0the\u00a0sitting\u00a0or former governors ofWashington,MontanaandColorado; the\u00a0sittingmayor of New York City;andsittingorformermembers of the House of Representatives andSenate.Harris and the press:Trump falselyclaimedof Harris: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t do any interviews.\u201d Trump is entitled to argue that Harris has not done a sufficient number of interviews as the Democratic presidential nominee, but the assertion she doesn\u2019t do \u201cany\u201d iswrong; Harris has done multiple interviews in recent weeks. Notably, Harris did an interview with the CBS News show \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which aired Monday, whileTrump backed outof his own interview with the show.Harris-Walz and the Supreme Court: After correctly noting that Harris\u2019 running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, recentlyexpressed supportfor getting rid of the Electoral College, Trump falselyclaimed, \u201cThey want to add\u2026 they\u2019re thinking about \u2013 first time I heard this number \u2013 25: they want to have 25 Supreme Court justices.\u201d There is no basis for the claim that Harris or Walz is pushing for a 25-justice Supreme Court.Walz and menstrual products in schools: TrumpdisparagedWalz as \u201cTampon Tim,\u201d then said, \u201cYou know why they call him that? \u2019Cause they sell tampons, with special legislation, in boys\u2019 locker rooms.\u201d Trump\u2019s claim is false. The law Walz signed in 2023 requires schools to provide free menstrual products in bathrooms, not the sale of menstrual products in locker rooms \u2013 and all 18 public school districts that responded to CNN\u2019s questions about the law say they do not provide the products in boys\u2019 bathrooms.

The Biden administration has made a push to get automakers to reduce emissions and adopt electric vehicles, but there is not a mandate for consumers; thetailpipe rulesfor automakers that were unveiled by the administration earlier this year aim to have electric vehicles make up 35% to 56% new vehicles sold in 2032.The Paris climate accord and emissions: Trumprepeatedhis false claim that under the Paris climate accord, the US \u201chad to pay a trillion dollars\u201d while some other countries didn\u2019t have to pay.Trump\u2019s \u201ctrillion\u201d figure is a wild exaggeration.Under the Obama administration,the US paid$1 billion of a $3 billion commitment it originally made in 2014. After Trump pulled the country out of the Paris accord, the US paid nothing to theglobal finance goal. And while Bidenpledged $11.4 billion annuallyfrom the US, this level of funding hasn\u2019t materialized. That\u2019s because Congress, responsible for appropriating the nation\u2019s budget, has allocated onlya fraction of that\u2013 roughly $1 billion in 2022.Harris\u2019 comments on fracking: Trump said, \u201cListen to Kamala in her own words very recently,\u201d then played two video clips in which Harris said she was in favor of banning fracking. But those clipsare from 2019, beyond any reasonable definition of \u201cvery recently.\u201d Harris hassaidduring the 2024 campaign that she no longer favors banning fracking.Venezuela, prisons and migration: Trump falselyclaimed, \u201cIn Venezuela, many countries, they\u2019re emptying their prisons into our country.\u201d This is false. Trump has never corroborated this claim about Venezuela, let alone \u201cmany countries,\u201d and experts have told CNN,PolitiFactandFactCheck.orgthat they know of no evidence for it.\u201cWe have no evidence that the Venezuelan government is emptying its prisons or mental health institutions to send them outside the country, in other words, to the U.S. or any other country,\u201d Roberto Brice\u00f1o-Le\u00f3n, founder and director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, an independent organization that tracks violence in the country, said in an email to CNN in June, after Trump made similar claims.Venezuela, criminals and migration: Adding another colorful story about Venezuela, Trump falselyclaimedthat \u201cthey take the criminal gangs from Caracas off the streets and they bus them into the United States and drop them.\u201d This is false. There is no evidence of Venezuelan authorities somehow busing gang members into the US.The world prison population: Trumprepeatedhis false claim that \u201cthe prison population all over the world is down, because they put them in our country.\u201d The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from at least about10.77 million peopleto at least about10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom.\u201cI do a daily news search to see what\u2019s going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,\u201dHelen Fair, co-author of the prison population list and research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London, said in June, when Trump made a similar claim.The number of migrants: Trump, speaking about migration, falselyclaimedthat \u201c21 million people \u2013 plus \u2013 came into our nation\u201d under the Biden-Harris administration.Through August, the country hadrecordedabout 10.3 million nationwide \u201cencounters\u201d with migrants during the Biden-Harris administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country; even adding in so-called \u201cgotaways\u201d who evaded detection,estimatedby House Republicans as being roughly 2 million, there\u2019s no way the total is \u201c21 million.\u201dHarris, migrants and criminals: Trump, criticizing Harris on immigration, againwrongly describeda set of statistics that was released in September. He falselyclaimedin Scranton, \u201cYou saw that last week: 13,099 murderers allowed to come in, through them.\u201d He falselyclaimedin Reading that \u201cas we speak she has \u2013 and this was just announced last week \u2013 13,099, so over 13,000 illegal alien convicted murderers, roaming free in our country.\u201dThis 13,099 figure includes people who are incarcerated in federal, state and local prisons and jails \u2013 and it includes people who entered the country over decades, including during Trump\u2019s administration, not just under Biden and Harris. You can read morehere.Harris\u2019 record as attorney general: Trump falselyclaimedthat when Harris was attorney general of California, \u201cshe said under no circumstances\u201d will people be prosecuted for the crimes of child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon or the rape of an unconscious person. Harris did not say anything like that; Trump was grossly mischaracterizing adebateover the language Harris\u2019 office used to summarize California ballot initiatives.Trump\u2019s border wall: Trumprepeatedhis false claim that \u201cI built over\u00a0500 miles of wall\u201d on the southern border. Official governmentdatashows 458 miles were built under Trump \u2013 including both wall built where no barriers had existed before and wall built to replace previous barriers.Trump\u2019s crowds: Trump falselyclaimedof his rallies: \u201cWe never have an empty seat.\u201d There have been empty seats atnumerous Trump ralliesover the years \u2013 includinghundreds at this very rallyin Reading. And at many Trump rallies, some once-filled seatsempty outduring his speeches when supporters leave.Trump\u2019s crowd in Butler: Trump falselyclaimedthere were \u201cover 100,000 people\u201d at therallyhe held Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, at the same site where a gunman had attempted to assassinate him in July. CNN affiliate KDKA in Pittsburghreportedthat the Secret Service put the crowd at 24,000 people, while the Trump-supporting sheriff of Blair County, Pennsylvania, James Ott,saidin his speech at the rally itself (more than three hours before Trump took the stage) that he was looking out at \u201c21,000-plus people.\u201dTrump\u2019s response to the assassination attempt: Trump, speaking of his response to the attempted assassination in July, falselyclaimed, \u201cI said as I was getting up \u2013 before\u00a0I even got up \u2013 I said, \u2018How many people were killed?\u2019 Because, you know, it was wall to wall people, and\u00a0I said, \u2018How many people were killed?\u2019 They said, \u2018We\u00a0think three, sir,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s not good.\u2019\u201dTrump\u2019s rally microphonepicked up what was saidby Trump and Secret Service agents while he was on the ground and just after, and he did not ask, before or after he got up, how many people were killed. It\u2019s possible he did so after he was whisked off stage (and, of course, possible he was genuinely misremembering what happened in such a traumatic moment).Trump and firefighters: Trump falselyclaimed, \u201cWe got the firefighters endorse us, you probably heard.\u201d But the actual recentnational newswas that the International Association of Firefighters had decided not to endorse any candidate in the race; while Trump is free to argue that this was a victory for him, given that the union endorsed Biden in 2020, it was not an actual endorsement. And while there were some people in the Scranton crowd holding \u201cScranton Firefighters for Trump\u201d signs, the Scranton chapter of the union also has not issued an endorsement. The president of the chaptertoldthe Scranton Times-Tribune that none of the people he saw holding the signs were active or retired local firefighters.Trump and classified documents: Speaking of the criminal case against him over his post-presidency retention of classified documents, Trumprepeatedhis false claim that \u201cI had the Presidential Records Act; I was totally\u00a0allowed to do it.\u201d ThePresidential Records Actsaysthat, the moment a president leaves office, the National Archives and Records Administration gets custody and control of all presidential records from their administration.\u00a0(Trump\u2019s case wasdismissedby a federal judge in July on other grounds, that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith was unconstitutional; Smith hasappealed.)The New York Times and the Russia investigation: Trump, calling claims about his 2016 campaign\u2019s connections to Russia a \u201cscam,\u201d repeated his false claim that The New York Times \u201cadmitted they were wrong\u201d about the coverage thatwon its journalists a Pulitzer Prizealong with journalists from The Washington Post.\u201cThe claim is completely false,\u201d Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander said in an email to CNNin 2023, when Trump made a similar claim; Stadtlander noted that \u201cthe award wasupheldby the Pulitzer Prize Board after an independent review\u201d and said the Times\u2019 reporting \u201cwas also substantiated by the Mueller investigation and Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into the matter.\u201dThe New York Times and the 2016 election: Trump repeated a false claim he made during his presidency,sayingof The New York Times\u2019 coverage of the 2016 election: \u201cRemember in 2016 they had to\u00a0do an editorial apologizing to their readers\u00a0because they said, \u2018He\u2019s going to lose\u2019\u2026and then I won?\u201dAs the Timesnotedin 2017 in response to such Trump claims, it did not apologize for its 2016 election coverage. It did publish a post-electionletter, from then-executive editor Dean Baquet and publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., that said the election had raised several questions, including this: \u201cDid Donald Trump\u2019s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?\u201d But the letter did not include an apology, to Trump or anyone else.Trump and the defeat of ISIS: Trump repeated his falseclaimthat \u201cwe defeated ISIS in four weeks; it was supposed to take four or five years.\u201d The ISIS \u201ccaliphate\u201d was declared fully liberatedmore than two yearsinto Trump\u2019s presidency.Military equipment surrendered to the Taliban: Trumprepeatedhis false claim that \u201cwe gave $85 billion worth\u201d of US military equipment to the Taliban. Trump\u2019s figure is a massive exaggeration; the Pentagon hasestimatedthat the equipment abandoned to the Taliban by Afghan forces upon their 2021 collapse was worth about $7.1 billion \u2013 a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021.Biden and foreign income: Trump repeated his falseclaimthat \u201cBiden got a lot of money from China.\u201d After years ofinvestigationby House Republicans, there is still no evidence Biden has received any Chinese money.Chris Wallace and a question about the Biden family: Trumptoldhisfamiliarfalse story about how he had asked Biden at a 2020 presidential debate why the wife of a mayor of Moscow had paid Biden $3.5 million \u2013 in fact, the money was sent to a firm connected to the president\u2019s son Hunter Biden, not to the president \u2013 but moderator Chris Wallace, then of Fox News and now of CNN, had interjected to say, \u201cWell, please don\u2019t ask him that question.\u201d Wallace never did that. As the transcriptshows, Wallace interjected during this debate exchange to try to get Trump to\u00a0allow\u00a0Biden to answer Trump\u2019s question about the payment, not to stop Trump from asking.Inflation: Trump repeated his falseclaimthat inflation under Biden and Harris is \u201cthe worst inflation in the history of our country.\u201d Trump could fairly say that the USinflation ratehit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the all-timerecordof23.7%, set in 1920, and the rate has since plummeted; the most recent available inflation rate at the time Trump spoke here was2.5%in August.Mortgage rates: Trump falselyclaimedthat young people can\u2019t buy a house because interest rates are higher than 10%: \u201cIt\u2019s not 10%, it\u2019s 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 percent.\u201d This is false. The average rate on a standard 30-year fixed mortgagewas 6.12%in the week ending October 3, according to mortgage financing provider Freddie Mac, and6.32%in the week ending October 10.Trump\u2019s tax cut: Trump repeated his falseclaimthat \u201cI gave you, as you know, the largest tax cut in the history of our country.\u201d Expert analyses havefoundthat his 2017 tax cut law was not the largest in US history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or in inflation-adjusted dollars.Tariffs on China: Trump repeated two of his regular false claims about tariffs on imported Chinese products. He falselyclaimedthat China \u201cpaid hundreds of billions of dollars\u201d in these tariffs during his presidency, then falselyclaimedthat before his presidency, \u201cnobody ever brought in 10 cents, not one other \u2013 not 10 cents, you check those records.\u201dWe\u2019ve checked, and the truth is that the US wasgenerating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on China before Trump took office; in fact, the US has had tariffs on Chinese imports since the 1700s. Second, US importers pay these tariffs, not China, andstudy after studyhas found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump\u2019s tariffs.The 1890s and tariffs: Touting the supposed benefits of tariffs, Trump falselyclaimedthat in the 1890s, when the UShad very high tariffs, \u201cOur country was the richest it ever was.\u201d The US is far richer today than in the 1890s; per capita gross domestic product isnow many times higherthan it was then.The trade deficit with China: Trumprepeatedhisfrequent false claimthat the US trade deficit with China has averaged \u201c$500 billion\u201d per year. The US hasnever\u00a0had a $500 billiontrade deficit with China even if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade in which the US traditionally runs a surplus with China; the all-time record, about $418 billion, was set under Trump in 2018.Harris and taxes: Trumpplayeda deceptively editedvideoshowing \u201cThe View\u201d co-host Meghan McCain saying to Harris in 2019, \u201cEverything from a 70 to 80% tax rate,\u201d and Harris responding, \u201cI think that\u2019s fantastic.\u201dThis video cuts out key words from theexchange; Harris was not specifically endorsing high tax rates when she made the \u201cfantastic\u201d comment.Here\u2019s the transcript of the 2019 exchange:McCain: \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the party. She officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi. She wason \u201860 Minutes\u2019 this weekendproudly calling herself a radical. And she\u2019s promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car, should be eliminated within the next 11 years, everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. Do you agree that she could possibly \u2013 and this ideology, of the socialist left \u2013 could splinter your party?\u201dHarris: \u201cNo. You know, I think that she is challenging the status quo. I think that\u2019s fantastic. I think that \u2013 you know, I used to teach, before, especially before \u2013 in the last few years \u2013 and the thing that I always loved about teaching was when you teach, it requires you to defend the premise. And it requires you to re-examine the premise. And question, is it still relevant? Is it \u2013 does it have impact? Does it have meaning? And I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. And I think it\u2019s good for the party, I frankly think it\u2019s good for the country. Let\u2019s look at the bold ideas. And I\u2019m eager that we have those discussions. And when we are able to defend status quo, then do it, and if there are \u2013 you know, if there\u2019s not merit to that, then let\u2019s explore new ideas.\u201dBiden\u2019s documents case: Trump falselyclaimedin Reading that, in an investigation into Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents, \u201cBiden was essentially convicted\u201d and in Scrantonthat\u201cthey ruled on him, they said he\u2019s guilty.\u201d Biden was not convicted, \u201cessentially\u201d or not, and was not found guilty; in fact, Biden was not even charged with a crime. The special counsel in the case, Robert Hur,wrotein his public report that \u201cthe evidence does not establish Mr. Biden\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d adding that \u201cseveral defenses are likely to create reasonable doubt as to such charges.\u201dA supposed Biden gaffe: Mocking Biden\u2019s gaffes, Trump falselyclaimed, \u201cBut the worst was when he was in New Hampshire and he said, \u2018It\u2019s great to be in Florida.\u2019 That\u2019s palm trees.\u201d This never happened. Biden has certainly made various geographic gaffes, ashasTrump, but he never said he was in Florida when he was actually in New Hampshire."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump press secretary pick removed post praising Pence on January 6, then ran for Congress as an election denier", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/02/politics/karoline-leavitt-pence-january-6-2020-election/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Karoline Leavitt, President-elect Donald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s incoming White House press secretary, deleted two social media posts she shared after the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol \u201a\u00c4\u00ee including a retweet praising then-Vice President Mike Pence for certifying the 2020 election.The postincluded a video of Pence calling the attack \u201a\u00c4\u00faa dark day in the history of the United States Capitol\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 as he presided over the certification of the results hours after the riot. Trump to this day criticizes Pence for certifying the results of the 2020 election, falsely claiming it was stolen due to rampant voter fraud.Inanother post praisingthe actions of a Capitol Hill police officer who lured rioters away from lawmakers, Leavitt wrote simply, \u201a\u00c4\u00faA hero.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Leavitt, who at the time was 23 and had recently departed Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s White House Press Office, had just accepted a job working for New York Rep.

Leavitt then ran unsuccessfully for a New Hampshire congressional seat in 2022, positioning herself as a staunch election denier.\u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m the only candidate in this race to say that President Trump won in 2020, and I will work my hardest every single day to make sure we get to the bottom of it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Leavitt said during a September 2021 interview with OANN, whichshe posted on her X account.In another interview in October of that year, Leavittagain deniedthat Joe Biden had won the 2020 election legitimately.\u201a\u00c4\u00faI do believe that if we were to audit all 50 states in this country, there is absolutely no way we would find Joe Biden legitimately won 81 million votes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI fundamentally do not believe that, and I will tell you the majority of voters on the Republican side do not believe that either.

Nancy Mace as recently as last year called herself \u201cpro-transgender rights\u201d and said she supported children exploring gender identities with different hairstyles, clothing and preferred pronouns, a stark contrast to more recent comments that have put her in the national spotlight.Last week, the South Carolina Republicanintroduced a resolutionto amend the rules of the US House of Representatives to ban transgender women from using women\u2019s restrooms at the Capitol andfiledbroader legislation that would apply to every federal building and federally funded school.The resolution came in direct response to the election of Democratic Rep.-elect Sarah McBride of Delaware, the first out transgender person elected to Congress.In hundreds of tweets over the last week, Mace has used a flood of anti-transgender rhetoric, includingrepeatedlycallingtransgender people \u201cmentally ill,\u201d which is a stark \u2014 and unexplained \u2014 departure fromher past positioningas a self-proclaimed pro-LGBTQ Republican.In July 2023, Mace described herself as \u201cpro-transgender rights\u201d and voiced support for children exploring their identities, such as by changing pronouns, hairstyles or clothing.\u201cIf they wanna take on a different pronoun or a different gender identity or grow their hair out, or wear a dress or wear pants, or do those things as a minor \u2013\u2014 those are all things that I think most people would support. Be who you want to be, but don\u2019t make permanent changes as a child,\u201dMace saidin an interview last year.Mace made the comments in the context of saying she opposed gender-affirming care for minors.\u201cThey may decide as an adult, \u2018Hey, instead of being Johnny, I want to be Jill\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s OK,\u201d she said. \u201cBut let them figure that out and make that decision when they can consent.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint a clear through line for when Mace shifted her tone to be so harshly anti-transgender.Just a month afterdescribing herself as \u201cpro-transgender rights\u201d and supporting children exploring their identities, Mace spoke out against transgender women competing in women\u2019s sports. While the shift might not necessarily be contradictory in policy, it represented a departure in tone, moving from seemingly supportive and inclusive language to critical rhetoric.In texts with CNN, Mace reiterated her past support for LGBTQ rights, including voting for same-sex marriage. She clarified that while she has no issue with individuals dressing as they choose or using preferred pronouns, she opposes transgender women accessing women\u2019s private spaces, citing concerns about protecting women and girls. Mace, however, also described transgender individuals as needing to \u201cseek help.\u201d\u201cVoted for gay marriage twice. Would do it again. Have supported pro LGBTQ legislation. Draw the line at women being forced to undress in front of men or men using our bathrooms or any private spaces,\u201d Mace told CNN.Mace has in the past credited her personal connections to LGBTQ individuals for shaping her inclusive rhetoricIn 2021, she co-sponsored the Fairness for All Act, which aimed to ban discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation while carving out exemptions for religious institutions.\u201cI strongly support LGBTQ rights and equality,\u201dshe saidat the time. \u201cNo one should be discriminated against. \u2026 I have friends and family that identify as LGBTQ. Understanding how they feel and how they\u2019ve been treated is important. Having been around gay, lesbian and transgender people has informed my opinion over my lifetime.\u201dHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said last week there is a policy throughout the Capitol complex that effectively bans transgender women from women\u2019s restrooms and other female-designated spaces in the Capitol.\u201cAll single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office Buildings \u2014 such as restrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms \u2014 are reserved for individuals of that biological sex,\u201d the Louisiana Republicansaid in a statement.He did not outline how the policy would be enforced but noted that unisex restrooms are available throughout the Capitol.McBride responded on social media, \u201cI\u2019m not here to fight about bathrooms. I\u2019m here to fight for Delawareans and to bring down costs facing families.

That said, Trump has never shied away from firing someone he once backed.FBI directors get those 10-year terms as the result of a post-Watergate law that was in response to J. Edgar Hoover\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s much-too-long and controlling 48-year leadership of the FBI.The term length is supposed to inoculate the director from political pressure. But it never works out that way.If Trump fires Wray, he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d be first president to fire 2 FBI directorsTrump famouslyfired then-FBI Director James Comeymonths after taking office for his first term in 2017. Comey was also a Republican, although he was nominated to the position by Democratic President Barack Obama. (Comeylater said in 2018that he \u201a\u00c4\u00facan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be associated with\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the Republican Party due to Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s influence on the GOP.)Presidents before Trump pushed FBI directors outIn 1993, Bill Clintonfired then-FBI Director William Sessionsafter an internal ethics report emerged during the prior year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presidential campaign. It included questions about a $10,000 fence installed around the director\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s home and flights he had taken, among other issues.Earlier, Jimmy Carter suggested during the 1976 presidential campaign that he would have firedthen-FBI Director Clarence Kelleyover revelations about window drapery valances improperly installed at his home, among other things. Carter did not immediately fire Kelley when he took the White House, but Kelley was ultimately forced to resign, according to Douglas Charles, a history professor at Penn State University, who noted that the drapery scandal \u201a\u00c4\u00fatoday seems like very small fry stuff.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9But at the time, it would have tested the new law, which Congress passed in 1976, for Carter to fire Kelley.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere certainly was the question, can any president fire an FBI director when there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a legislated 10-year term,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Charles said.While that question has clearly been answered now, those previous firings were about ethics and personal failings. Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s are about policy differences, including over the role of the Justice Department overall.Why did Trump fire Comey?The stated reasons for Comey\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s firing,laid out in a memoprepared for Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Justice Department, were contradictory. Comey was criticized both for not prosecuting Hillary Clinton over her treatment of classified material and then for releasing \u201a\u00c4\u00faderogatory\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 information about Clinton at a press conference.The real reason Comey was fired,as Trump admittedto NBC News at the time, was Comey\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s investigation into ties between Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2016 campaign and Russia.Former FBI director James Comey takes his seat at the beginning of the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in Washington, DC, on June 8, 2017.Andrew Harnik/APThen Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s troubles cascadedIn the furor that followed Comey\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s firing, it was the author of the Justice Department memo recommending Comey\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s firing, then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, whoappointed a special counselto follow up on the Russia investigation.Rosenstein appointed the special counsel because Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, hadrecused himselffrom any investigation related to Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2016 campaign. Sessions did so because he had failed during Senate confirmation hearings to disclose preelection contacts he had with Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ambassador to the US at the time.Enter another former FBI directorWho did Rosenstein pick as special counsel to lead that Russia investigation? Robert S. Mueller III, who happened to be the former FBI director. Mueller was widely respected and had taken charge of the FBIdays beforethe 9/11 attacks in 2001. Congress passed aspecial lawto extend his term by two years during the Obama administration.Anyone who remembers Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first term can recall that speculation about the Russia investigation sucked up much of the oxygen in Washington and led to the prosecution of several of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s top 2016 campaign aides, including campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who Trump later pardoned. Trump has complained that the investigation was part of a \u201a\u00c4\u00fadeep state\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 effort to undermine him.Unintended consequencesThecooperationby Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s former fixer Michael Cohen with Mueller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s investigation is what led to revelations about hush money payments for which Trump was convicted in New York earlier this year. Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sentencing for his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records has beendelayed indefinitelyafter his election win.What the Mueller report concludedThe release of Mueller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s report wasslow-walkedby Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second attorney general, Bill Barr, who gave the impression that Mueller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s report exonerated Trump. It did not.Mueller was constrained by Justice Department rules that bar the prosecution of a sitting president. When the full report was released in April 2019, Mueller said there was not enough evidence to prove collusion between Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign and Russians. It also specifically did not exonerate Trump.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhile this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9the report said. It also concluded that while Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign in 2016 expected help from Russia, it didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t conspire with Russia. That gets forgotten after years of Trump referring to Mueller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s investigation as the \u201a\u00c4\u00faRussia hoax.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9There are things that helped generate the Mueller investigation, notably thediscredited Steele dossier, that will forever anger Trump.Then-special counsel Robert Mueller makes a statement about the Russia investigation on May 29, 2019, at the Justice Department in Washington, DC.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesTrump targeted FBI officialsThere were also related scandals, such as the release of anti-Trump texts by an FBI agent at the time, Peter Strzok, who initially played a role in Mueller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s inquiry, and Lisa Page, who was then an FBI attorney with whom Strzok was having an affair. TheFBI agreedin July of this year to pay $2 million to Strzok and Page to compensate for the release of those text messages.Another FBI official, Andrew McCabe, who served briefly as acting director after Trump fired Comey, was fired by Sessions days before his retirement. McCabe, now a CNN contributor, ultimatelywon back his pension in court.Trump turned on WrayWray wasoverwhelmingly confirmedto succeed Comey in August 2017 in part by promising during confirmation hearings to maintain independence from the White House. Trump, meanwhile, prizes loyalty.Even while Trump was still presidentin 2020, he had already turned on Wray, in part because he felt Wray was not cooperating with special counsel John Durham \u201a\u00c4\u00ec who was appointed by Barr, Sessions\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 replacement, to investigate the Mueller investigation.In this 2017 photo, then-President Donald Trump sits with FBI Director Christopher Wray in Quantico, Virginia.Evan Vucci/AP/FileAll of that adds up to why Trump wants loyalists at the Department of Justice, including the FBI.Douglas said that about 100 years ago, in the wake of the Teapot Dome scandal that exposed corruption within the federal government, there was talk in the Senate of taking the Department of Justice, including the FBI, completely out of politics and making it and all of its employees an independent part of the civil service.Trump wants to go in the opposite direction today and bring the FBI more under the control of the president."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "The common national experience that explains Trump\u2019s 2024 gains", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/trump-wide-gains-2024-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014The most impressive aspect ofDonald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris last week was the uniformity of his gains across the electoral landscape.But paradoxically, the very magnitude of his gains may offer Democrats their best hope of recovery in the next few elections. The across-the-board nature of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s improvement suggests that his victory wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t primarily driven by the two campaigns\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 tactical choices, messaging decisions or advertising strategies.Trump gained ground in urban, suburban and rural counties and improved on his vote share, as of the latest counts, in 49 of the 50 states.A preliminary CNN analysisconcluded that Trump ran better than he did in 2020 in fully 9 in 10 of the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s counties where results are available.Those sweeping gains document how much ground Democrats lost this year \u201a\u00c4\u00ee not only in places where they were bracing for further retreat (including both in rural communities and urban centers) but also the racially diverse, well-educated suburbs that had earlier keyed the resistance to Trump. Those losses leave Democrats in a weaker electoral position, in most respects, at the start of the second Trump presidency than at the outset of his first.But the scale of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s advance this year points toward a common national experience in all regions of the country \u201a\u00c4\u00ee a shared disappointment in the results generated by PresidentJoe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s administration, primarily on inflation, but secondarily around other issues led by immigration and crime. The evidence that the outcome was driven largely by a negative verdict on Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s performance underscores the possibility that Democrats could recover sooner than now seems possible if Americans one day conclude that Trump hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t delivered the better results he has promised.A flag is left at an event held by Vice President Kamala Harris at Howard University in Washington, DC, on November 6, 2024.Daniel Cole/ReutersRelated articleStill-stunned Democrats begin to squint toward their futureThe consistency of the Democratic decline this year \u201a\u00c4\u00fareflects a very broad sense of discontent across many different demographic groups, across every major population group, with the direction of the country under Biden,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz. Trump and the GOP, he said, face the same risk of reversal if the president-elect pursues some of the policies that voters remained uneasy about even as they voted for him \u201a\u00c4\u00ee especially if he can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t ease the cost-of-living squeeze that drove much of this year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s result.Experts agree that factors beyond disappointment in the Biden administration\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s outcomes also influenced the results. These ranged from a widening cultural gap between Democrats and Latinos, especially men, to continuing resistance among some voters to entrusting the presidency to a woman, to the GOP\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s successful efforts to portray Harris as an extremist cultural liberal largely through attacks on views about transgender issues she expressed during her 2020 presidential campaign.But more targeted dynamics can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t explain a shift as comprehensive as the one the country experienced last week. Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 loss, as a quasi-incumbent, followed a well-established pattern: When an outgoing president faces widespread discontent over his performance, his party has almost always failed to hold the White House in the election to succeed him. (That dynamic applied when Democrats Harry Truman in 1952 and Lyndon Johnson in 1968 stepped down rather than seek reelection, and again in 2008 with Republican George W. Bush leaving office after his two terms.)\u201a\u00c4\u00faPeople struggle to find explanations for what is going on with Hispanic men, or with young people, but the most common explanation [to all of them] is the right one,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck, the co-author of well-respected books on the 2016 and 2020 elections. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNobody thinks things are going well, and if you are the incumbent you own that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Two sophisticated new geographic analyses of the results underscore just how powerful and pervasive the movement toward Trump was this year. One comes fromthe Daily Yonder websitepublished by the nonpartisan Center for Rural Studies.The center has developed a system that categorizes the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s roughly 3,100 counties into six categories from the most urban (major metro core counties) to the most rural (nonmetropolitan counties). In between, the center divides counties into the categories of suburbs of those major cities; medium-sized cities; the suburbs of those medium-sized cities; small communities; and the rural, nonmetropolitan counties.President Donald Trump arrives to speak during an election night event at the Palm Beach Convention Center on November 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Florida.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesANALYSISTrump is already wielding power and causing massive disruptionAccording to the preliminary analysis of the election results the group provided to me, Trump gained in all six kinds of counties \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and by strikingly similar amounts. Trump improved his vote by 4 percentage points in each of the two most populous categories \u201a\u00c4\u00eethe major metro core counties and their suburbs \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and by 3 percentage points in each of the other four groupings of smaller places.This was a more consistent rise than the center has recorded across the spectrum of urban-rural counties in any recent election. From 2004 to 2008, Barack Obama improved on John Kerry\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s performance in all six kinds of counties, but Obama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gains varied more \u201a\u00c4\u00ee from about 3 points in the smallest places to roughly double that in the largest. From 2008 to 2012, Obama improved slightly in the three groupings of largest places but lost ground in the three smaller categories. In 2016, Hillary Clinton ran better than Obama in the largest places, but Trump ran far better than Mitt Romney, the GOP\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2012 nominee, in the smaller ones.Tellingly, the closest recent comparison to Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s uniform gains this year was Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4sperformance four years ago. Biden improved on Clinton\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s share of the vote by between 1.5 to 2 percentage points in all of the center\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s categories of midsized counties, and by 0.5 points in the two poles of their scale: the very largest urban centers and the smallest rural places.Biden in 2020did not gain ground across the countryin as large a percentage of counties as Trump did in 2024. But, as the center\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s data showed, Biden then, like Trump now, improved quite consistently across the map, from the most urban to the most rural places.Abramowitz says the state-level results send a similar message about how much Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s electoral recovery this year resembles his decline four years earlier. In 2020, five states flipped from Trump to Biden; in 2024, they all flipped back to Trump (as did Nevada, which narrowly backed Biden four years ago). In 2020, Biden won Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,the three former \u201a\u00c4\u00fablue wall\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 statesthat decided the election, by a combined 257,029 votes. As of last weekend, Trump led in those three states, all of which he won, by a combined margin of 256,940 votes.In all, Biden in 2020, according to the CNN analysis, improved over Clinton\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s showing four years before in 42 states. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not as many as moved toward Trump this year; but both elections, Abramowitz noted, look quite different from the much more mixed results of 2016, when Trump improved on the GOP\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2012 performance in 38 states but lost ground in 13 others.Vavreck said Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first election in 2016 produced a lasting ideological and demographic \u201a\u00c4\u00fareshuffling\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that moved states with large populations of non-college White voters (such as Iowa and Ohio) toward the GOP while cementing the Democratic advantage in diverse and well-educated states that became light blue during the Obama years (Colorado and Virginia).But since then, she said, the similarly uniform shift away from Trump in 2020 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and then back toward him in 2024 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee points toward voter assessments of performance, rather than big further ideological shifts, as the main driver of the results. Just as Trump, as the incumbent, suffered from a negative verdict on his performance in 2020, Harris, as the quasi-incumbent successor to Biden, suffered from a negative verdict on the president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s performance four years later.Former President Donald Trump holds a news conference from inside trash hauler at the airport in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on October 30, 2024.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesRelated articleWe asked Americans what they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d heard about Trump and Harris throughout the campaign. Here\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what they told us\u201a\u00c4\u00faA lot of that is kind of pure retrospective voting: Things are not going well, so kick the incumbent out,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Vavreck said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn 2020, Biden picks up everywhere. Now we look from \u201a\u00c4\u00f420 to \u201a\u00c4\u00f424 and the Democrats are losing [ground] everywhere.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9A second new geographic analysis of the 2024 election results also underscores the comprehensive nature of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gains. The center-left Brookings Metro think tank for several years has correlated the election results with federal data that records how much each county contributes to the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s total economic output.Those analyses consistently have foundthat Democrats now dominate the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highest-output counties, which tend to be large metro areas that have transitioned the fastest into the 21st century information-age economy. Republicans, meanwhile, run best in places generally on the outskirts of the major metro areas that are more dependent on the powerhouse industries of the 20th century: agriculture, energy extraction and manufacturing.The group\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s new analysisshows those divisions largely holding this year.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe first thing to say is that the country remains extremely divided economically,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro who directs this research. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t changed.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9But the results this year also show Trump establishing what Muro called a \u201a\u00c4\u00fatoehold\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most productive metro areas, particularly across the Sun Belt. In 2020, Trump won just five of the 100 counties that contributed the most to the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s overall economic output, while Biden carried an astounding 95. This year, Trump has already won 17 of the 100 most productive counties and Harris 78 (with five still to be called).Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gains in those very high-output counties, as well as his success in flipping at least another roughly 70 counties from blue to red, has dramatically increased the share of national economic output contributed by the places that support him. In 2020, Biden won only a little more than one-sixth of the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s counties, but the places he captured generated over 70% of the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s total economic output. This year, Trump has already won counties that account for 40% of the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s economic output (with 161 counties still to be called at the time Brookings conducted this analysis late last week).The highest-output counties Trump flipped were almost entirely in the Sun Belt: from Hillsborough (Tampa) and Tarrant (Fort Worth) to Maricopa (Phoenix).Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recapture of Maricopa was especially dramatic, after Biden in 2020 became the first Democratic presidential nominee to carry the county since Truman in 1948.Muro says Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gains in high-output metros across the Sun Belt, like his support fromElon Muskand other conservative Silicon Valley leaders, show Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s potential to establish a beachhead in new-economy bastions that almost all viewed him with suspicion during his first term. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is the sort of the leading edge of the Trump governing base that now has picked up a number of significant economic centers in addition to its literally thousands of small-town and rural places,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Muro said.The question, Muro said, is whether Trump can preserve that beachhead while pursuing policies he pledged,such as the mass deportationof undocumented immigrants, sweeping tariffs, rescinding theBiden-passed incentives for clean energyand possibly also semiconductor manufacturing, and potentially moving to restrict civil rights and liberties. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Trump agenda,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Muro said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fadoes not seem like one conducive to maximizing the output of the country and particularly the dense blue metros.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Donald Trump talks to reporters at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters headquarters in Washington, DC, on January 31, 2024.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesRelated articleWhy Trump surged in New York, but House Democrats succeeded in the stateMuro\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s question about the high-output metros applies more broadly: While disappointment with Biden provided a huge lift for Republicans last week, moving forward Trump will need to sustain support on the strength of his own agenda, leadership style and results.The exit pollsconducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN,as well as the VoteCast studydone by NORC in partnership with the Associated Press and other media organizations, made clear that even as voters returned Trump to the Oval Office, many of them retained doubts about his agenda and personal style. Across the two studies, a majority of voters described Trump as \u201a\u00c4\u00fatoo extreme\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and likely to steer the US toward authoritarianism, while majorities also expressed opposition to his mass deportation plan; majorities also indicated support for legal abortion and a greater government role in ensuring health care coverage for Americans.The surveys made clear that those concerns were submerged by the towering discontent with the results of the Biden presidency. In the exit polls, about three-fifths of voters said they disapproved of Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s performance, and two-thirds described the economy in negative terms. About 80% of the voters who disapproved of Biden voted for Trump, as did about 70% of those who expressed negative views about the economy, the exit polls found.As a result of those cross-cutting pressures, a critical share of voters who expressed concerns about Trump or his agenda in the two surveys voted for him anyway: For instance, one-fourth of women who described themselves as supporting legal abortion in the exit polls still voted for Trump. So did about one-fourth of Latinos who said in the exit polls they opposed mass deportation. About 1 in 8 voters who described Trump as too extreme, or said he would lead the US toward authoritarianism, likewise backed him anyway.Vavreck said it should be surprising that even many voters resistant to elements of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s agenda prioritized more immediate concerns \u201a\u00c4\u00ee particularly their frustration over the cost of living, as well as issues such as the border and crime. Those frustrations created an almost insuperable barrier for Harris.But in a little over two months, Trump, once again, will be the incumbent. And in Vavreck\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s phrase,heand his party will own the results of the coming years. If Americans feel he has made progress on the problems they elected him to solve, he will likely maintain a strong position. But if they feel he has not, or if they conclude he has created new problems with his policies, there could be a turn away from Trump and the GOP in the 2026 and 2028 elections that is just as uniform as the movement toward them last week."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Army general who oversaw Afghanistan withdrawal promoted to four-star officer after GOP senator drops hold", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/02/politics/chris-donahue-general-promoted-afghanistan-withdrawal/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014An Army general who oversaw theUS withdrawal from Afghanistanwas promoted to a four-star officer after a Republican senator dropped a hold on his nomination, according to a Senate aide.The Senate on Monday confirmed Lt.

The organization was established in November 2022 as a more long-term extension of the work of 18th Airborne Corps, which deployed to Europe to reinforce NATO\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s eastern flank after Russia invaded Ukraine.In a military career that has spanned more than three decades since his graduation from West Point, Donahue has deployed 20 times, including time in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, North Africa and Eastern Europe, according to his Army biography.Mullin was one of the most vocal Republicans calling for accountability after the Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 US service members during the final days of the evacuation from Afghanistan. On the third anniversary of the bombing, Mullin said that \u201a\u00c4\u00fanot one person has been held accountable for the disaster\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and explicitly named Donahue.

A number of Democrats who were once willing to wait their turn on the leadership ladder have suddenly lost their patience. After watching President Joe Biden wait months to step aside only to hand over the White House to Trump, those Democrats are now more eager to challenge their party\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conventions \u201a\u00c4\u00ee including the sacrosanct principle of seniority in leadership.In public, Jeffries, a reserved leader who is known for being selective about when he puts his thumb on the scale, has not weighed in on whether he would back Rep. Jamie Raskin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenge to Rep. Jerry Nadler, the long-serving top Democrat on the influential House Judiciary Committee.But several Democrats at Jeffries\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 leadership table have privately been egging on Raskin, who is 16 years\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 Nadler\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s junior, as they hunt for the best attack dog in Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Washington, according to four people familiar with the discussions. Raskin, who currently holds the top Democratic spot on the House\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Oversight panel, is choosing to instead run for Judiciary because he considers it the \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe headquarters of Congressional opposition to authoritarianism.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faOur unified Caucus must strategize and organize like never before\u201a\u00c4\u00eeevery single one of us working together every single day until we win the House back in 2026 and then beyond that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Raskin wrote in a letter to fellow Democrats on Monday.From left, Reps.

In the 11-month impeachment inquiry into Biden that Republicans conducted this Congress, Raskin continually got in sparring matches with Comer in hearings and became a regular fixture on cable news.\u201a\u00c4\u00faJamie Raskin made mincemeat out of Comer over and over again in the 118th Congress. If that is any indication of how he would do leading the Judiciary Committee, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be something that a lot of Democrats want to see,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Huffman, who is supporting Raskin, told CNN.Nadler \u201a\u00c4\u00ee who led both impeachments against Trump and has spent seven years as top Democrat on the panel \u201a\u00c4\u00ee has his own loyalties within the caucus. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s revered by many progressives and has already endured a number of cutthroat campaigns, including a nasty congressional primary against a fellow Democratic chairman just two years ago.Throughout the impeachment investigation, Jeffries appeared to defer to committee Democrats at every turn and only got involved when needed. Behind the scenes, Democrats were constantly deliberating when to respond to Republican claims and when doing so would only amplify the GOP efforts.By challenging Nadler, Raskin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vacancy on Oversight offers an opportunity for a deep bench to throw their hats in the ring. Democratic Reps. Stephen Lynch and Gerry Connolly, who have both run for the top post before, are considering trying again, sources tell CNN.But they will have to contend with younger members like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is also weighing whether to leapfrog the seniority on the committee and lead a new era of pushback against Republicans."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "US left facing a difficult situation in Syria as rebels make massive advances against Assad regime", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/02/politics/us-syria-diplomatic-situation/index.html", "content": "WashingtonCNN\u2014The surpriseoffensive on Aleppo by Syrian rebel groupshas left the US in the difficult position of not fully supporting either side while also maintaining aforce postureof nearly 1,000 troops in Syria as part of the ongoing mission to fight ISIS.Maj.

In 2016, the FDA decided that e-cigarettes qualified as tobacco products and it began reviewing authorization applications for millions of vaping products.The industry says that the FDA changed its method in the middle of the process, requiring companies to show that flavored products are more effective than tobacco-flavored products at helping smokers quit or cut back on cigarettes.Theconservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the industry in January, finding that officials had perpetrated a \u201a\u00c4\u00faregulatory switcheroo,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 sending manufactures on a \u201a\u00c4\u00fawild goose chase\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in to get approval.Seven other appeals courts have rejected similar challenges of the agency\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s denials.President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.Getty ImagesRelated live-storyBiden pardons son Hunter as Trump forges ahead with presidential transitionThe case is one of several pending before the Supreme Court that faces an uncertain future in part because of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s election last month.

It also alleges that he sexually pursued female staffers, and that the organization ignored another staffer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s alleged sexual misconduct.The report is the latest scrutiny into Hegseth, a veteran and former Fox News host with no prior government experience, ahead of what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s expected to be a tough Senate confirmation process. It comes on the heels ofreports detailing a sexual assault allegationfrom 2017, which Hegseth has denied and in which no charges were filed.Asked by CNN for comment about the magazine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reporting, a Hegseth adviser said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to comment on outlandish claims laundered through the New Yorker by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s. Get back to us when you try your first attempt at actual journalism.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s team had provided The New Yorker with an identical statement.The seven-page whistleblower report was compiled by former employees of Concerned Veterans for America, the advocacy group where Hegseth was president from 2013 to 2016, and sent to its senior management in February 2015, The New Yorker reported. The magazine did not name the employees, and CNN has not independently reviewed the report.The report, according to The New Yorker, alleges that Hegseth had to be restrained from joining the dancers on stage at a Louisiana strip club where he had brought his team \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and that the organization ignored a female employee\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s allegation that another member of Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s staff attempted to sexually assault her at that strip club.It claims that his management team \u201a\u00c4\u00fasexually pursued\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 employees and divided the organization\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s female staffers into two groups \u201a\u00c4\u00ee \u201a\u00c4\u00faparty girls\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fanot party girls,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The New Yorker reported.In a separate complaint, which The New Yorker reported was emailed by a different employee to Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s successor as head of Concerned Veterans for America in late 2015, the employee alleged that while on a work trip to Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, Hegseth and someone traveling with the group\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Defend Freedom Tour closed down a hotel bar and yelled multiple times, \u201a\u00c4\u00faKill all Muslims!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9In the letter, the staffer criticized Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fadespicable behavior\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and said it \u201a\u00c4\u00faembarrassed the entire organization.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The staffer also wrote about another incident where Hegseth \u201a\u00c4\u00fapassed out\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the back of a party bus and then urinated in front of a hotel where the organization\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s team was staying, according to the magazine.The New Yorker reported that when reached for comment, the author of the letter, who was not named by the magazine, said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you print that, I will deny I wrote it.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time running Concerned Veterans for America came after an earlier, controversial tenure leading Vets for Freedom, a nonprofit backed by Republican billionaire megadonors.A former associate of the group, the magazine reported, said the group\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s donors became concerned about money being wasted on rumored parties that \u201a\u00c4\u00facould politely be called trysts,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and other inappropriate expenses. With the group mired in more than $500,000 in debt by early 2009, donors chose to wind it down and transfer most of its management to another veterans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 group. Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s role was reduced, and he ultimately departed years later.Margaret Hoover, a CNN political commentator who was an adviser to Vets for Freedom between 2008 and 2010, told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Erin Burnett last month that Hegseth ran the organization \u201a\u00c4\u00favery poorly\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and lost donors\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 confidence. She said the organization had less than 10 employees and a budget of less than $10 million.\u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd he couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t do that properly,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Hoover said, raising questions about his ability to lead the Defense Department. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know how he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to run an organization with an $857 billion budget, and 3 million individuals, based on what I saw in those years.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9CNN previously reported that a woman accused Hegseth of sexually assaulting her in the early morning hours of October 8, 2017, in Monterey, California, where Hegseth had a speaking engagement the night before. The accuser told police that Hegseth physically blocked her from leaving a hotel room, took her phone and then sexually assaulted her.The Monterey County district attorney told CNN last month said that her office declined to file charges against Hegseth in January 2018 because \u201a\u00c4\u00fano charges were supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She declined to comment further. Hegseth insists that the encounter with the unnamed woman was consensual.Years later, Hegseth paid the accuser in a settlement agreement that included a confidentiality clause, his attorney Timothy Parlatore told CNN in a statement last month. Parlatore said Hegseth settled because it was during the \u201a\u00c4\u00faMe Too\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 movement and he didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to lose his job at Fox News if the accusation became public. The statement did not share how much the accuser was paid as part of the settlement, although Parlatore said it was \u201a\u00c4\u00faa significantly reduced amount.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s alleged conduct toward women came under further scrutiny over the weekend, when The New York Times reported thathis mother sent an emailto her son in 2018 that sharply criticized his treatment of women.Penelope Hegseth told her son in the email that there are \u201a\u00c4\u00famany\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 women whom he has \u201a\u00c4\u00faabused in some way\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and encouraged him to \u201a\u00c4\u00faget some help,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the email published by The Times.According to The Times\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 report, Penelope Hegseth wrote, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego. You are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that, but it is the sad, sad truth.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Penelope Hegseth on Friday told The New York Times that she wrote the email \u201a\u00c4\u00fain anger, with emotion\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and that she had immediately apologized in a separate email. She went on to defend her son, saying her own characterization of his treatment of women in the 2018 email \u201a\u00c4\u00fahas never been true.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Alayna Treene contributed to this report."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "White House halls decked with \u2018peace and light\u2019 holiday theme", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/02/politics/white-house-christmas-decorations/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014The White House has been spruced up and transformed into a gilded winter wonderland after more than 300 volunteers and residence staff spent the holiday weekend decking the halls for the final time under the Biden administration.The theme of this year\u2019s decorations, the Office of the First Lady announced Monday, is a \u201cseason of peace and light,\u201d drawing on the spirit of the holiday season \u2013 and the d\u00e9cor hewed closely to the theme, with thousands of twinkling lights and floating paper doves.\u201cThe holidays have always held a special place in our hearts, and we\u2019ve loved opening the doors of the People\u2019s House wider and wider each year, continuing the spirit of goodwill and gratitude,\u201d President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden wrote in a welcome letter to visitors.They continued, \u201cAt the holidays, Americans come together every year in fellowship and faith, reminding us that we are stronger as a community than we are apart.

The judges overseeing his cases will likely cancel the sentencing hearings, which were slated for December 12 in the gun case and December 16 in the tax case.The broadly crafted pardon explicitly grants clemency for the tax and gun offenses from his existing cases, plus any potential federal crimes that Hunter Biden may have committed \u201cfrom January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024.\u201d This time frame, importantly, covers his entire tenure on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma and much of his other overseas work, including in China.

He also argued that many people who pay back all of their late taxes, like Hunter did, are allowed to resolve their problems through civil enforcement, instead of facing criminal charges.This is the latest instance of an outgoing president using the pardon power to help a family member: Shortly before they both left office, Bill Clinton pardoned his brother and Donald Trump pardoned the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner.\u201cAs sympathetic as Hunter Biden\u2019s circumstances might be, a pardon from Joe Biden would still be an abuse of the clemency power,\u201d said Jeffrey Crouch, a leading expert on pardons who teaches at American University. \u201cPresidents should not use clemency to help out their friends, family and allies in order to further their own personal interest.\u201dHoliday decisionAs much as Joe Biden had hoped to remain deferential to the judicial system \u2014 and even after promising to stay out of the case \u2014 sources told CNN the president decided after Thanksgiving that a pardon was the right move.\u201cHe feels Hunter was targeted in order for his political opponents to hurt him and that was cruel and he endured enough,\u201d a White House official familiar with the situation told CNN on Sunday. \u201cOnce he made it, there was no sense in delaying it further.\u201dOne thing that particularly swayed the president: a belief that Republicans were trying to \u201cbreak Hunter,\u201d as he said in his statement, while his son was still recovering from addiction.

The president shared his decision in that meeting with senior aides, some attending in person but most by phone, the source said. First lady Jill Biden was also on hand for the meeting.The president told staff to prepare to release a statement about the pardon on Sunday, the source said, and staff regrouped on Sunday morning to iron out the details.In the days before the pardon, Hunter Biden\u2019s attorneys circulated a52-page documentoutlining the six-year federal investigation and claiming Trump and congressional Republican were the driving force behind his legal problems. The language mirrored much of what the president said in his Sunday statement explaining his decision to pardon his son.In the wake of Trump\u2019s election victory last month, White House aides began to sense that a pardon \u2014 or a commutation of the younger Biden\u2019s sentences \u2014 was a distinct possibility.

That\u2019s how some federal judges have seen it as they\u2019ve struck down anti-trans policies, including those preventing minors from obtaining gender-affirming care.Or should a ban on transgender care be subject only to \u201crational basis\u201d review, which requires a state to show that it is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest? This method usually applies to commonplace business rules and requires judges to defer to state legislators.The answer to this threshold issue in Wednesday\u2019s case will go a long way to determine the protections afforded transgender Americans in the future.The Tennessee ban enacted last year is one ofat least 25 state prohibitionson gender-affirming care,according to KFF. It arrives at the Supreme Court as new fights have erupted over competitive sports and bathroom policies, at schools and in thehalls of the US House of Representatives. During his successful bid to regain the White House, former President Donald Trumpmocked transgender interestsand spent tens of millions of dollars in the final weeks of his campaign on ads attacking transgender people.Anestimated 1.5 million peoplein America are transgender, less than 1% of a US population that tops 300 million.The intense atmospherics over this minority may expose the vulnerability of trans people in America and a greater need for constitutional protection. Or, alternatively, the Supreme Court may be persuaded to leave an increasingly fraught area of the law to elected legislators and the democratic process.Adding to the suspense of this closely watched case, the lower court ruling now before the justices was tailored to the current right-wing bench. It was written by a conservative US appellate judge who is among the most respected by the justices and crafted in terms that would fuel their interest in narrowly construing rights.The6th US Circuit Court of Appealsimposed the lowest level of review, saying bans on transgender care do not amount to sex discrimination. As such, it broke from precedent on sex-based classifications and a pattern among judges who\u2019d found that bans on gender-affirming care necessarily discriminate based on sex because they are tied to a minor\u2019s sex at birth and cover only treatment that transgender people choose to undergo.The levels of scrutiny and why they matterThe Supreme Court has laid out three tiers of scrutiny in such debates over equal protection of the law: \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d the toughest review, for any government classification based on race, national origin and religion, and demanding a compelling governmental justification; \u201cheightened,\u201d or intermediate, scrutiny, for classifications based on sex, requiring that the law serve an important governmental objective; and, finally, \u201crational basis,\u201d requiring only a rational relationship between the regulation and a legitimate government interest.A key factor in the calculation is whether the people at the heart of the case are particularly vulnerable to discrimination and unable to vindicate their rights through the usual political process.Protesters of Kentucky Senate Bill SB150, known as the Transgender Health Bill, cheer on speakers during a rally on the lawn of the Kentucky Capitol in Frankfort on March 29, 2023.Timothy D.

He said such bans should be considered mainly in the context of a restriction on medical treatment for minors.\u201cThe laws regulate sex transition treatments for all minors, regardless of sex,\u201d Sutton wrote, concluding that the state could justify its ban based on its responsibility to protect the health of children. Sutton, an appointee of President George W. Bush, emphasized the potential for irreversible medical consequences, such as sterility.Sutton was joined by Judge Amul Thapar, an early Trump appointee to the 6th Circuit who\u2019d also been considered for the Supreme Court during Trump\u2019s first term. He maybe in contention yet again should a vacancy arise.The Biden administration said the 6th Circuit\u2019s rationale would subject anti-trans laws \u201cto no greater judicial scrutiny than a law banning compounded milk, regulating optometrists, or expelling hotdog pushcarts from New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter.\u201dThe 6th Circuit panel majority also brushed aside the Supreme Court\u2019s leading precedent on transgender rights,Bostock v. Clayton County. In that 2020 case, the justices ruled that gay and transgender workers were covered by a prohibition on discrimination \u201cbecause of \u2026 sex\u201d in Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.US Supreme Court Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett speaks at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Foundation in Simi Valley, Calif., April 4, 2022.Damian Dovarganes/APRelated articleThe last best hope for Supreme Court liberals: Amy Coney Barrett\u201cIn Bostock,\u201d Sutton wrote, differentiating the cases, \u201cthe employers fired adult employees because their behavior did not match stereotypes of how adult men or women dress or behave. In this case, the laws do not deny anyone general healthcare treatment based on any such stereotypes; they merely deny the same medical treatments to all children facing gender dysphoria if they are 17.\u201dBringing into play the high court\u2019s interest in originalism, Sutton wrote at the outset that the challengers could not rely on the \u201coriginal fixed meaning\u201d of the Constitution\u2019s equal protection guarantee.\u201cThat prompts the question whether the people of this country ever agreed to remove debates of this sort \u2013 over the use of innovative, and potentially irreversible, medical treatments for children \u2013 from the conventional place for dealing with new norms, new drugs, and new public health concerns: the democratic process,\u201d he wrote, \u201cLife-tenured federal judges should be wary of removing a vexing and novel topic of medical debate from the ebbs and flows of democracy by construing a largely unamendable Constitution to occupy the field.\u201d\u2018No parent would choose to make their child different\u2019Known as SB1, the Tennessee law prohibits physicians and other health care providers from prescribing any puberty blocker or hormone that would enable a minor \u201cto identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex.\u201dIt also bans any treatment to address \u201cpurported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity.\u201d (The law permits puberty blockers and hormones for other purposes, such as to treat congenital conditions and early puberty.)Physicians have prescribed such drugs to treat gender dysphoria, that is, the distress resulting from the incongruence between a person\u2019s sex and their gender identity. Gender-affirming care,according to research cited in briefssupporting the plaintiffs, can reduce adolescents\u2019 depression, anxiety, self-harm and risk of suicide.The text of the disputed law says it reflects Tennessee\u2019s \u201ccompelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty\u201d and a desire to prohibit medical care that would \u201cencourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201dVideo Ad FeedbackAlito, Kagan personify Court\u2019s ideological and political gulf, says CNN\u2019s Joan Biskupic02:16- Source:CNNThree transgender youths, their parents and a physician sued under the Constitution\u2019s equal protection and due process clauses. The Biden administration joined their side under a law that allows the government to intervene in equal protection lawsuits brought by private parties.When the justices agreed to hear the Biden administration appeal of the 6th Circuit\u2019s decision, in the case now called United States v. Skrmetti, it said it would take up only the equal protection issue. The court declined to reviewthe question of parents\u2019 rightsto make medical decisions for their children based on due process grounds.Like the challengers who started the Tennessee case, Solicitor General Prelogar emphasizes the difficulties faced by trans children and their families.\u201cFor many parents, questions about how best to raise transgender adolescents \u2013 including whether and how to take steps to enable them to live in accordance with their gender identity \u2013 are extraordinarily challenging,\u201d Prelogar wrote in her brief.Referring to one of the youths, a 13-year-old transgender boy known by a pseudonym, Prelogar wrote, \u201cJohn Doe\u2019s mother put the point in plain terms: \u2018This is what I think many people don\u2019t understand: no parent would choose to make their child different, or choose a harder path in life for their child.\u2019\u201dPrelogar will share time in the well of the courtroom with the ACLU\u2019s Chase Strangio, who represents the trans youths and their parents.In his written filing, Strangio addressed the consequences of the 6th Circuit\u2019s legal reasoning. \u201cIt will effectively immunize all forms of government discrimination against transgender people from meaningful constitutional scrutiny.

State officials differentiate Tennessee\u2019s ban from other sex-based policies that have come before the justices, such as different drinking ages for men and women, in a 1976 case from Oklahoma, or men-only admissions, in the1996 Virginia Military Institute dispute.In the milestone1976 case, Craig v. Boren, the court struck down a state law that allowed women to buy low-alcohol beer at age 18 but forbade men from doing so until age 21. The justices declared that such a sex-based classification violates the guarantee of equal protection unless it is substantially related to an important governmental objective.In the state\u2019s brief, Rice described such laws the justices began reviewing in the 1970s as \u201cclassic sex classifications.\u201d\u201cTennessee\u2019s law draws no similar sex-based line,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSB1 does not \u2018prefer one sex over the other,\u2019 \u2018include one sex and exclude the other,\u2019 \u2018bestow benefits or burdens based on sex,\u2019 or \u2018apply one rule for males and another for females.\u2019\u201dTennessee officials emphasize that the ban on transgender treatment refers to sex but does not differentiate based on sex. The law prevents minors desiring a gender transition \u2013 whether they be male or female \u2013 from using puberty blockers and hormones.Relevance of SCOTUS\u2019 recent rulingsThe current Supreme Court has been eliminating or constricting individual rights, most dramatically the reversal of abortion rights in the2022 case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which Tennessee officials repeatedly cite in their briefs.The court\u2019s2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, however, broke ground in the opposite direction. By a 6-3 vote, the court ruled that Title VII\u2019s protection against sex bias in the workplace can apply to gay and transgender employees.The decision, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, was tied to the specific text of Title VII prohibiting discrimination \u201con the basis of sex.\u201d The 6th Circuit declined to apply Bostock to the current dispute over the 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantee of \u201cequal protection of the laws.\u201dIf the Supreme Court adopts that 6th Circuit approach, it likely will not affect reliance on Bostock for Title VII workplace cases. But it could prevent judges from invoking it in transgender issues beyond employment, as some judges have done since 2020.In this March 2023 photo, people applaud during a rally in favor of legislation banning gender-affirming healthcare for minors at the Missouri Statehouse in Jefferson City, Missouri.Charlie Riedel/APRelated articleMissouri ban on gender-affirming care for minors upheld by judgeJudge Helene White, who dissented in the 6th Circuit case, in fact, noted that rulings under Title VII and the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause often cite one another.

Even as Republican outrage poured in, for Biden, it was an exercise of his fleeting executive authority that underscored how his family comes first.The president made clear he was worried, above all, about what fate could befall his son in his successor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s new administration.\u201a\u00c4\u00faHunter was singled out only because he is my son \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and that is wrong,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden said.

Trump used tariffs against Canada during negotiations over replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement.Many US imports from Canada and Mexico are exempted from tariffs because of the USMCA trade agreement among the three nations that Trump pushed for during his first administration. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not clear how Trump would plan to implement the proposed tariffs without violating the USMCA.Earlier this week, Trump spoke with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum for the first time following Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s tariff announcement, but they haveoffered conflicting statements about the call.Trump said Wednesday that Sheinbaum agreed to shut down the US-Mexico border, but Sheinbaum on Thursday denied doing so.Sheinbaum has also suggested that Mexico would retaliate with counter-tariffs if Trump went through with his threat.Trump has faced backlash over his tariff proposal in the recent days, including from President Joe Biden, who called it \u201a\u00c4\u00facounterproductive\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and warned it could \u201a\u00c4\u00fabegin to screw up\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the US\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 relationships with Canada and Mexico.This story has been updated with additional reporting.CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Paula Newton, Kim Berryman, Kaanita Iyer and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "How do your state\u2019s voting rules compare to others?
