It's a detail House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., raised when telling reporters last month that he was against releasing the report.\nBut it's not unheard of, as Casten pointed out on Tuesday.\n\"The Committee on Ethics has, on many occasions, released its reports on former members,\" Casten said in a statement. \"Resigning from Congress should not allow Members to avoid accountability for allegations as serious as those faced by Matt Gaetz. Withholding this report from the American people would impede the dignity and integrity of the legislative proceedings of the House.\"\nCasten introduced a similar resolution last month, but his office said it was allowed to expire by House GOP leaders over the Thanksgiving break.\nThe new resolution will likely not be sidelined so easily, with the House expected in session from now until Friday.\nRep.

Susan Wild, D-Pa., the top Democrat on the panel, hinted that the vote to do so fell along party lines.\n\"I'd say that a vote was taken.

The pardon covers all potential federal crimes in which he may have culpability from Jan. 1, 2014, through Sunday night (Dec. 1, 2024).\nWhy 2014?\nWell, the most damning evidence of the Biden family influence-peddling business occurred in the last years of Joe Biden\u2019s term as vice president \u2013 specifically, 2014 through 2016. That, of course, is when the Burisma hijinks began. Indeed, Hunter\u2019s board seat on the corrupt energy company\u2019s board was so manifestly tied to his father\u2019s political influence that, as soon as Biden left office in 2017, Burisma slashed Hunter\u2019s compensation in half.\nJONATHAN TURLEY: JOE BIDEN'S PARDON OF SON HUNTER CEMENTS HIS LEGACY AS LIAR IN CHIEF\nNot only that. The two lucrative schemes tied to the Chinese Communist Party \u2013 the Bohai Harvest RST investment enterprise and CEFC through which the Bidens netted several million dollars \u2013 also began in that 2014-16 time frame. So did the scheme in which Hunter collected a cool million from Romanian businessman Gabriel Popoviciu.\nThe Joe Biden vice-presidency phase also included the big Caf\u00e9 Milano dinner in Washington, at which the then-VP rubbed elbows with a number of Hunter\u2019s foreign business partners (the ones Joe Biden, when not making no-pardon vows, told us again and again he had nothing to do with because he never discussed business with Hunter). The guest list for that dinner includedEleana Baturina, the billionaire widow of Putin crony Yuri Luzhkov (the former mayor of Moscow) who also had a multi-million dollar transaction with Hunter.\nAs I\u2019ve detailed, the Romanian scheme mirrors the Burisma scheme: As the VP anchoring Obama administration foreign policy, Joe Biden publicly harangued governments in Bucharest and Kyiv to intensify their anti-corruption efforts; that paved the way for his enterprising son to earn millions from those governments\u2019 corruption targets (such as Popoviciu and Burisma\u2019s Mykola \"Nicolay\" Zlochevsky) by using the specter of the then-VP\u2019s political influence in seeking favorable treatment from those governments. And who can forget then-Vice President Biden\u2019s threat to the fledgling Ukrainian regime that a billion dollars in desperately needed U.S. funding would be withheld unless Kyiv fired the prosecutor who just happened to be investigating Zlochevsky and Burisma.\nNaturally, among the questions raised by all this is why Hunter and those in cahoots with him were not prosecuted for failing to register as foreign agents \u2013 the FARA law about which theBiden Justice Department touts its enforcement efforts.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nMoreover, if we had a one-tiered justice system in which everyone was treated equally, we couldn\u2019t help but notice that the facts of the Biden foreign business arrangements are remarkable similar to those arising from the Ukrainian business activities of Paul Manafort, President Trump\u2019s one-time 2016 campaign chairman.\nSpecial counsel Robert Muellerand his staff, which included several activist Democrats, threw the book at Manafort \u2013 not only tax and FARA charges but bank fraud, money laundering, etc. By the time he was convicted, Manafort was 69; and the charges against him had nothing to do with the focus of Mueller\u2019s probe, the bogus claim of Trump \"collusion\" with Russia; the prosecutors were squeezing him in hopes that they\u2019d give him something \u2013anything\u2013 on the then-president.\nPresident Biden and Hunter Biden head toward Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House, July 26, 2024.(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)\nBecause of that and many other examples of our two-tiered system, there have been some aggressive statements from the Trump camp that his election means the tables have turned. I suspect that this is hot rhetoric that will blow over, at least with respect tothe Biden family. The period from 2014 to 2016 was a long time ago. Even if theTrump Justice Departmentwere interested in pursuing new charges \u2013 again, I doubt that \u2013 the relevant statutes of limitations (five years for most federal crimes, six for some relevant tax crimes) have already expired.\nStill, President Biden is taking no chances. After all, an aggressive, creative prosecutor (perhaps in the mold of Jack Smith, but this time a zealous Republican) could cobble together a theory that Hunter and his cohorts \u2013 perhaps including the president and his brother Jim \u2013 were in a conspiracy that continued after 2016, perhaps even into 2020 and beyond. The proof for that might not be strong, it might even be non-existent. But in light of the evidence \u2013 including the evidence developed by the House Oversight Committee, which found thatthe Bidens reeled in over $27 millionfrom foreign persons and entities from 2014 to 2019 \u2013 there would certainly be a sufficient basis for a criminal investigation.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAnd as people in the Trump orbit who\u2019ve been hounded by Democratic prosecutors and committees can tell you, investigations are ruinous. They cost a fortune in legal fees, they dry up business opportunities, and they impose tremendous anxiety on suspects and their families.\nThe breathtaking expanse of Hunter\u2019s pardon \u2013 nearly 11 years for someone the president repeatedly told us had done nothing wrong \u2013 is clearly an effort to foreclose any further investigation ofthe president\u2019s sonover the 2014-16 period from which the Biden Justice Department quite intentionally averted its eyes.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANDREW McCARTHY\nAndrew C.

Over and over.\nAfter repeatedly promising, pledging, vowing not to pardon his son Hunter, the President of the United States did exactly that.\nThe move amounted to a devastating vote of no confidence in his own Justice Department, matchingDonald Trump\u2019sown denunciations of that very department.\nPRESIDENT BIDEN PARDONS SON HUNTER, SPARING HIM POSSIBLE PRISON SENTENCE\nTrump, who also pardoned several political allies during his first term, was quick to react on Truth Social:\n\"Does the pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\"\nAnd prominent Republicans are calling Biden a liar, with ample justification.\nBoth President Biden and President-elect Trump railed against the Justice Department following the former's pardon of his son, Hunter \u2013 albeit for markedly different reasons.(Reuters/Getty/AP Images)\nI think most people assumed that a father wouldn\u2019t let his son go to jail. And if the president had explained it in those terms, he might have garnered some public sympathy. But he did not.\nYou know how the president often talks about \"my word as a Biden\"? I mistakenly assumed that he wouldn\u2019t promise again and again not to pardon his son or commute his sentence if he had thought there was any possibility he would get Hunter off the legal hook.\nBut what is anyone going to do? He leaves office next month, his political career is over and the story will quickly fade.\nMEDIA ADMITS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS TOO 'WOKE' AFTER KAMALA HARRIS' 2024 LOSS\nBiden sounded very much like Trump as he accused the DOJ, which he had long defended, of treating his son unfairly \u2013 swinging the political door wide open for the president-elect to retaliate against Justice, in part by naming longtime confidant Kash Patel to runthe FBI.\nBiden said his son had been \"selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\" and he blamed\u00a0 political pressure on the special counsel named in the case.\n\"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter\u2019s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2014 and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter \u2014 who has been 5-1/2 years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they\u2019ve tried to break me \u2014 and there\u2019s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.\"\nMany were mistaken in their assumption that the President wouldn't pardon his son \u2013 however, with just under two months left of his term, and, presumably, his political career, Biden really has nothing to lose in doing so.(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\nBut that bolsters the Trump argument that he too was singled out for selective prosecution by the DOJ \u2013 and will be in a position to do something about it.\nHunter put out his own statement after the Sunday pardon: \"I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction \u2014 mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport.\"\nThe feeble attempts by some in the media and in Democratic politics to defend Biden are just sad, because they only tell half the story.\nLet\u2019s say Hunter Biden was in fact singled out for prosecution, that the case would have been routinely disposed of if his last name was Jones. (Hunter had already been convicted in one case and pleaded guilty in another to tax and gun-related charges.)\nBut as Hunter admitted in one email, it was his last name, when his father was vice president, that enabled him to land all those buckraking contracts from around the world. It\u2019s why the Ukrainian energy giant Burisma hired him, why he was able to get moneyfrom China.\nTRUMP HIT FOR HIRING LOYALISTS LIKE PAM BONDI: DOESN\u2019T EVERY PRESIDENT DO THAT?\nHunter had no expertise in any of these areas. What he had was a connection to a powerful father.\nThe pardon is so sweeping that it covers everything Hunter may have done from Jan. 1, 2004 through Sunday \u2013 which could be a way of his father protecting himself as well.\nKarine Jean-Pierre also told reporters on several occasions that Biden would not pardon Hunter.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeatedly assured reporters that President Biden wouldn't pardon Hunter.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\nHunter Bidenon Sunday night released a statement noting his recovery from addiction and his sobriety:\n\"I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction \u2014 mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport.\"\nMark Halperin argues that Biden put his son in jeopardy by running for president, knowing the full range of Hunter\u2019s addiction problems \u2013 and lied about Hunter not getting money from China and not helping his business clients (even if he just made small talk at a couple of group meetings).\nTRUMP NOMINATES KASH PATEL TO SERVE AS FBI DIRECTOR: 'ADVOCATE FOR TRUTH'\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s choice of Kash Patel for the FBI (who would replace his own appointee, Chris Wray, who replaced the fired Jim Comey) has sparked a media backlash.\nOne thing no one can argue is that Patel lacks experience. He has been chief of staff atthe Pentagonand a deputy assistant to the president. In fact, he was a national security prosecutor in the Obama Justice Department, before Trump got into politics.\nBut on Steve Bannon\u2019s podcast last year, Patel said: \"Yes, we're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections. We're going to come after you, whether it's criminally or civilly.\"\nThe president-elect is facing a media firestorm of his own after he named Kash Patel the new FBI director over the weekend.(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\nPatel has also said that on day one he\u2019d shut down the FBI headquarters in Washington \u2013 ironically named for J. Edgar Hoover \u2013 and turn it into a museum on the \"deep state.\" Its 7,000 employees would be dispersed around the country.\nOne thing Biden never did was put any family members on the government payroll, as Trump did in naming Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, to top White House positions in the first term.\nNow Trump is continuing that tradition by naming Charles Kushner, Jared\u2019s father, as ambassador to France.\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\nThe elder Kushner had already served a couple of years in prison for a scheme that involved hiring a prostitute and sending the tape to his sister. But at least he had paid his dues when Trump later pardoned him, sparking Jared\u2019s interest in prison reform.\nTrump also picked Massad Boulos \u2013 the father of Tiffany Trump\u2019s husband \u2013 as White House adviser on Arab andMiddle Eastaffairs. All in the family.\nOne thing the press does is refer to Trump nominees as \"loyalists,\" as if that\u2019s a dirty word. Sunday\u2019s Washington Post had a headline describing \"loyalist Kash Patel.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBut while Biden named an inner circle of aides who had been with him as long as four decades, they were not dismissed as loyalists. That\u2019s because the media agree that these were the good guys. And who can forget former AG Eric Holder describing himself asBarack Obama\u2019s\"wingman.\"\nThe Hunter pardon has set in motion a potential cycle of both presidents using the DOJ and FBI for purely partisan ends, and Joe Biden bears full responsibility for that.\nHoward Kurtz is the host of FOX News Channel'sMediaBuzz(Sundays 11 a.m.-12 p.m. ET).\u00a0Based in Washington, D.C., he joined the network in July 2013 and regularly appears onSpecial Report with Bret Baierand other programs."}, {"source": "foxnews", "title": "Trump hit for hiring loyalists like Pam Bondi: Doesn\u2019t every president do that?", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hit-hiring-loyalists-pam-bondi-doesnt-every-president-do-that", "content": "FOX Business' Charlie Gasparino joined 'MediaBuzz' to discuss how digital media has overshadowed 'legacy media,' Elon Musk's possible conflicts of interest and Google possibly selling the Chrome browser.\nIt\u2019s spat out like a dirty word.\nDonald Trump\u2013 take a deep breath \u2013 is hiring loyalists.\nThe president-elect \u2013 can you imagine?? \u2013 is nominating people he knows will support him. He\u2019s used plenty of curse words, but nothing said by the media is more disdainful than loyalists.\nTRUMP DROPPED MATT GAETZ AFTER COMPLAINING ABOUT HIGH POLITICAL COST OF DEFENDING HIM\nNow stop and think: Doesn\u2019t every president hire loyalists?\nDidn\u2019t Joe Bidensurround himself with folks who had been with him for decades? Ron Klain, Steve Richetti and Tom Donilon created a protective bubble around the president. But few, if any, prognosticators dismissed them as loyalists.\nWhy? The press generally approved of Biden\u2019s picks, including Tony Blinken; the non-communicative Lloyd Austin (who didn\u2019t tell the boss about his cancer surgery), and the equally non-communicative Janet Yellen. The only person who stood out for great TV skills wasPete Buttigieg, the former presidential candidate and outgoing Transportation secretary.\nPresident-elect Trump has picked former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to lead the Department of Justice.(Getty Images)\nIt\u2019s hardly a recent development. George Washington took a team-of-rivals approach, naming Thomas Jefferson secretary of state and Alexander Hamilton as treasury secretary. So did Abraham Lincoln, with Salmon Chase as treasury secretary and William Seward as secretary of war.\nBut if Trump picks people he expects to support him, the knee-jerk media reaction is that they\u2019re dangerous to the country and will run roughshod over the rule of law.\nTrump didn\u2019t make much use of his Cabinet in his first term and I doubt he will this time, except for a handful of top positions. Besides, he runs the show. Any Cabinet member who strays off the reservation can get fired, \"Apprentice\"-style. Serving at the pleasure of the president and all that.\nHACKER OBTAINS HOUSE ETHICS TESTIMONY ON MATT GAETZ AS TRUMP MAKES CALLS FOR AG NOMINEE\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Trump wound up with an ideologically balanced Cabinet. The first wave \u2013 from Marco Rubio as secretary of state to a spate of current and formermembers of Congress\u2013 is generally impressive.\nBut then there was the fiasco over Matt Gaetz, now charging hundreds of dollars for Cameo videos, and such controversial nominees as Pete Hegseth, RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard. And also Dr. Oz. Not to mention animosity toward pro-union Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer as labor secretary.\nIt\u2019s quite obvious that the president-elect likes people he\u2019s seen on TV, and he watches a lot of Fox News.\nJen Psaki speaks onstage during \"Jen Psaki in Conversation with Lawrence O\u2019Donnell - Say More: Lessons from Work, the White House, and the World\" in New York City.(Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)\nBut consider: Jen Psaki and Symone Sanders-Townsend were both CNN contributors when they joined the Biden campaign and then held top jobs in the White House. Now they\u2019re hosting or co-hosting shows on MSNBC. Nobody bats an eye because they\u2019re viewed as good guys joining the right team.\nFrom Fox, Trump has picked Army combat veteran Hegseth; ex-Congressman Sean Duffy, a FOX Business co-host, and two frequent medical commentators.\nWhat\u2019s fascinating is the way many in the media have turned on Pam Bondi, a former Florida attorney general and career prosecutor who possesses the experience Gaetz lacked.\nTRUMP, DEFYING MEDIA PREDICTIONS, MAINLY PICKS SEASONED CAPITOL HILL VETERANS SUCH AS MARCO RUBIO\nSure, Bondi has said plenty of partisan things over the years, such as \"prosecuting the prosecutors,\" then quickly adding, \"the bad ones.\" She was part of Trump\u2019s first impeachment legal team and then ran the legal arm of a pro-Trump PAC.\nBondi was passed over in the first Trump term because she accepted a $25,000 campaign donation from Trump\u2019s foundation while her office was conducting a probe of Trump University (itself a mess).\n\"Fox & Friends Weekend\" host Pete Hegseth hosts the 2022 Patriot Awards from Hollywood, Fla.(Fox Nation/Bryan Many)\nIn 2013, Bondi accepted a $25,000 campaign donation from Trump\u2019s foundation at the same time her office was conducting a fraud investigation into Trump University.\n\"Her acceptance of the donation coincided with her decision not to bring fraud charges against Trump University,\" says MSNBC legal analyst Barbara McQuade. No evidence of a quid pro quo emerged. And a Florida ethics panel cleared her of any wrongdoing. But that\u2019s old news now.\n\"Bondi has shown a taste for vengeance herself \u2014 at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Bondi embraced chants of \u2018lock her up,\u2019\" McQuade says. \"Even joking about jailing a political opponent is an insult to the rule of law.\"\nBut wait \u2013 didn\u2019tBarack Obama\u2019sAG, Eric Holder, describe himself as the president\u2019s \"wingman\"? There\u2019s clearly a different standard for Democrats.\nRachel Maddow producer Steve Benen says Bondi \"falsely accused then-special counsel Robert Mueller of leading a \u2018corrupt\u2019 investigation that was \"worse than Watergate.\u2019\"\nOn the other hand, Dave Aronberg, now state\u2019s attorney for Palm Beach County, lost his race to challenge Bondi as AG, but she hired him anyway as drug czar. \"She\u2019s someone who believes in the rule of law..I do not believe she will be Matt Gaetz 2.0. She is not going to burn it all down.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nI suppose it comes down to a question of trust. The pro-Kamala media refuse to give many Trump nominees the benefit of the doubt. Bondi has criticized the weaponization of the DOJ. You might even call her a loyalist.\nBut she will be the new attorney general, and that will be the ultimate test.\nHoward Kurtz is the host of FOX News Channel'sMediaBuzz(Sundays 11 a.m.-12 p.m. ET).\u00a0Based in Washington, D.C., he joined the network in July 2013 and regularly appears onSpecial Report with Bret Baierand other programs."}]
