He vowed on the campaign trail to use a new White House term to enact \u201cretribution\u201d and has openly talked about using America\u2019s governing institutions, and even the military, to punish his foes. He has pledged to launch a mass deportation of undocumented, and even some legal, immigrants that could set off a showdown with the courts.Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally at the Alliant Energy Center on October 30 in Madison, Wisconsin.Scott Olson/Getty ImagesRelated articleWhere Harris\u2019 campaign went wrongCNN projected Trump\u2019s victory after the state of Wisconsin put him over the top and he secured the270 electoral votesneeded to win the presidency. His win ended the Democrats\u2019 desperate attempt to thwart his return to power, which saw Vice PresidentKamala Harrishurriedly elevated to the party nomination after already unpopular PresidentJoe Biden\u2019s disastrous performance at the CNN debate against Trump in June.The former president outpaced his own performance in a losing cause four years ago, putting the states of Georgia and Pennsylvania back into the GOP column and retaining North Carolina for his party \u2013 all of which Democrats had targeted as part of the vice president\u2019s path to the White House.Trump campaigned on searing authoritarian-style rhetoric and false claims that the nation\u2019s towns and cities were under \u201coccupation\u201d from foreign criminals and gangs. But he also tapped into a palpable thirst for change among Americans still feeling the painful aftereffects of a now-cooled run of high inflation. And he warned that only he could stop a slide to World War III as foreign crises rage.He haspromised to create the greatest economyin the world and to make life more affordable for working Americans who form the populist base of the Republican Party that he transformed. Trump\u2019s supporters see him as a unique figure whose blunt, sometimes vulgar and often racially suggestive rhetoric reveals him as a scourge of political correctness. But the spectacle of the final days of the campaign being dominated by debate overwhether Trump is a \u201cfascist\u201dreflects the fresh challenges he\u2019s likely to pose to democratic guarantees and presidential decorum in the years ahead and the dread of at least half the electorate who voted for Harris that he plans to establish authoritarian-style rule.Former President Donald Trump appears in court with his lawyers Todd Blanche, Emil Bove and Susan Necheles for his hush money trial at Manhattan Criminal Court on May 28 in New York City.Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesRelated articleWhat happens to Trump\u2019s criminal and civil cases now that he\u2019s been reelectedTrump\u2019s victory is also certain to lead to thedismissal of special counsel Jack Smithand will mean that the president-elect paid no electoral price for his attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 election, which culminated in his supporters\u2019 mob attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.After years highlighting Biden\u2019s age, Trump, at 78, is now the oldest man to be elected president ,and his every act and utterance as commander in chief is likely to be scrutinized for signs of age-related slowing down or cognitive issues.Given the extreme nature of his campaign, his election may also augur a period of national andinternational turmoil. Trump has vowed to use his second term to seek \u201cretribution\u201d against his political adversaries and mused aloud about using the military against \u201cthe enemy from within.\u201d Overseas, US allies are bracing for the return of the wild unpredictability in US foreign policy that Trump whipped up in his first term.

It underlines that his victory in 2016 was not an aberration but heralded a major realignment in domestic politics and the US\u2019 role in the world. It also means that Biden\u2019s legacy will no longer be defined by his success in ejecting Trump from power in 2020 but by his hubris in seeking a second term that would have ended when he was 86, which opened the door to his rival again.Former President Donald Trump emerges to speak at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Wednesday, November 6, 2024.Will Lanzoni/CNNRelated articleTrump\u2019s second term will look nothing like his firstAnd Trump\u2019s success means that he has for the second time defied the aspirations of millions of Americans for a female president, since his vanquishing of Harris follows his 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton, again preventing the shattering of what she called \u201cthe highest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d in US politics.Trump\u2019s false claims that he was illegally ejected from power in 2020 formed the foundation of his return four years later, since millions of Americans bought into his alternative reality. The ex-president\u2019s defiance \u2013 and his capacity to weaponize charges against him \u2013 was best illustrated by the way he seized onhis mug shot, taken in a Georgia jail after he was indicted over election interference in the state. He turned the photo into a political rallying call for a primary campaign that previously lacked juice, using subsequent legal woes \u2013 including a criminal conviction in Manhattan in ahush money case\u2013 to keep his base energized by claiming he was being indicted for them. His sense of indestructibility \u2013 and the almost divine purpose felt by many of his supporters \u2013 was reinforcedwhen he narrowly escapeda would-be assassin\u2019s bullet at a rally in Pennsylvania, and rose, with his ear bloodied and his fist in the air, and told his supporters to \u201cfight, fight, fight.\u201dFormer President Donald Trump, with blood on his face, raises his fist to the crowd as he is surrounded by Secret Service agents at his campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.Evan Vucci/APThe promises that Trump made on the campaign trail leave many Americans braced for one of the most disruptive and divisive periods in the country\u2019s modern memory. Trump has promised to immediately launch thebiggest deportation operationin history on Day 1 \u2013 targeting undocumented immigrants and legal Haitian refugees whomhe falsely accusedof eating the pets of Ohio residents. The president-elect has also pledged a fundamental overhaul of the US economic system and plans to introduce sweeping tariffs on foreign imports \u2013 with especially punitive hikes on Chinese goods \u2013 that willcause global shockwaves.Republicans have alreadywon back the Senate, according to CNN\u2019s projection, meaning that the president-elect will have huge latitude to complete his bid to transform the judiciary to ensure conservative legal dominance continues for decades. The race for the House of Representatives is still in the balance, but if Republicans can retain their narrow majority, Trump will face few challenges to his rule in Washington.An unfettered presidency?Trump and his supporters have made clear that they believe his most authentic instincts were thwarted in his first term by establishment figures in Washington. He and his loyalists have therefore proposed plans that could gut the government\u2019s administrative departments and replace civil servants with political loyalists who will carry out his most draconian political desires. Trump has also vowed to sweep away the top layers of personnel at the Justice Department and in the intelligence agencies that he considers biased against him.Former President Donald Trump speaks at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, on November 6, 2024.Will Lanzoni/CNNRelated articleHere\u2019s what Trump is proposing for the economyHis plans will almost certainly cause a showdown over the extent of presidential powers between the White House and the courts. And any efforts to use the instruments of government to push his own personal and political agendas and to punish his enemies could severely test the rule of law. But Trump has made no secret that he plans to fully exploitthis summer\u2019s Supreme Court rulingthat granted commanders in chief substantial immunity for White House official acts and bolstered his already questionable claims that the president enjoys unchecked power.Trump\u2019s return to power is alsocertain to end the federal prosecutionsthat resulted from his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Trump\u2019s new attorney general will be able to end the case being brought by Smith on election interference and his appeal to revive a trial over Trump\u2019s hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The status of a state prosecution in Georgia over Trump\u2019s bid to overturn Biden\u2019s victory there is more uncertain but is likely to result in a legal tussle over the capacity of a state to put a sitting president on trial. Trump has, meanwhile, made clear that he is open to pardoning supporters convicted and sent to prison for their role in the Capitol insurrection.Police clash with pro-Trump rioters who had entered the Capitol. This was the first time the Capitol had been breached since the British attacked and burned the building in August 1814, during the War of 1812.

A mercurial foreign policy that mirrors his volcanic character is expected to further erode Washington\u2019s position as the head of a rules-based, Western democratic world order. He has pledged to end the war in Ukraine shortly after taking power. His affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he referred to as a \u201cgenius\u201d on the campaign trail, risks a resolution that validates the Kremlin\u2019s illegal and bloody assault on a sovereign democratic nation. Such a strategy would raise questions about America\u2019s potential appeasement of foreign autocrats and its traditional support for upholding the territorial integrity of its allies in Europe and the Pacific, including NATO partners and Taiwan.The president-elect has not wavered in his view that American allies have been freeloading off US security guarantees for decades, and he is likely to put intense pressure on them to do more to ensure their own means of defense. Some experts credit him with forcing NATO nations into bolstering their own military capacity in his first term. And his victory is likely to be welcomed by Israel, as it pursues its wars against Hamas in Gaza and against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and in some Gulf states that agreed with Trump\u2019s extreme hardline stance against Iran in his first term. Trump\u2019s supporters believe that he will fix what they see as America\u2019s weakness abroad, especially after thechaotic US withdrawalfrom Afghanistan on Biden\u2019s watch.A new test for a rattled national psycheTrump, if he completes his four-year second term, will become the oldest sitting president in history, a milestone that will be rich in irony since his relentless attacks on Biden\u2019s age and mental faculties paved the way for his successor\u2019s exit from the political stage.During the campaign, Trump\u2019s own mental lapses and unpredictable behavior raised speculation about his health and cognition \u2013 a theme that is likely to last throughout his second presidency. And the former president\u2019s undimmed habit of inserting himself into every cultural and political debate and incessant zeal for igniting clashes with his political and personal adversaries promise another test for the national psyche.Trump will be accompanied into the White House byVice President-elect JD Vance, an Ohio senator who emerged as a potential heir to Trumpism with his vehement defenses of his new boss on the campaign trail.

Jim Justice was projected to pick up the Senate seat vacated by retiring Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Joe Manchin. Democrats had stopped contesting the seat after Manchin announced he wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t seek reelection.In Ohio, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who has served in the chamber for three terms, willlose his reelection bid, CNN projects, in a state that has gone from a perennial political bellwether during his tenure to a deep red stronghold. The new Republican senator will be businessman Bernie Moreno, a vehement Trump supporter.And early Wednesday morning,CNN projectedthat in Montana, Republican businessman Tim Sheehy, a retired Navy SEAL, defeated three-term Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.Cruz and Scott cruise to reelectionThe few Democratic opportunities to mitigate their losses dwindled quickly throughout the night.In Florida,GOP Sen. Rick Scotteasily dispatched a challenge from Democratic former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who had built her campaign partly on a backlash to the overturning of the federal right to an abortion and Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s six-week abortion ban. Democrats had hoped that an abortion measure on the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ballot could boost Democratic turnout, but that measure failed Tuesday night.The party\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s best chance to pick up a seat had been in Texas, where national party groups made late multimillion-dollar investments into trying to unseatGOP Sen. Ted Cruz. But the two-term senator will defeat Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, CNN projects, in yet another disappointment for Democrats as they chase the mirage of making inroads in the longtime Republican state.And in Nebraska, CNN projects that RepublicanSen. Deb Fischerwill defeat a stronger-than-expected challenge from independent Dan Osborn, who, along with his allies, outspent Republican forces in the state. Her loss wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t necessarily have flipped the seat to the Democrats, since Osborn hadn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t said which party he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d caucus with in Washington. But with Democrats trying to stave off a GOP majority, an Osborn win would have deprived Republicans of a seat.Outstanding racesDemocrats had always faced a prohibitive path this year in defending their narrow control of the Senate, given the incumbents facing reelection are either in states Trump had carried twice before or narrowly lost in 2020.There are several key outstanding competitive races that have not been called.Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is running for a third term, is in a tight race with Republican Eric Hovde, in a state also critical to the presidential race.In another blue wall state critical to Democrats\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 success up and down the ballot, two national security specialists are facing off in Michigan. Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin is seeking to hold the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow. She is facing Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers, the one-time chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who left Congress in 2015.In Pennsylvania, Democratic Sen. Bob Casey is trying to hold off a challenge from Republican Dave McCormick, who lost out on Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s backing during the 2022 Senate primary but secured it, and the GOP nomination, this year.The final numbers in the Senate will also have to await the result from Nevada, where first-term Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is up against Republican Sam Brown, an Army veteran who also lost a primary two years ago for the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s other Senate seat. And in Arizona, where Democratic-turned-independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is retiring, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego is facing Trump acolyte Kari Lake, the 2022 gubernatorial nominee who still refuses to acknowledge her defeat in that race.There was not much to cheer for Democrats on the Senate map on Tuesday, but Democrat Angela Alsobrooks was projected to beat Maryland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Republican formerGov. Larry Hogan, who was popular in the solidly blue state.

A president-elect who already believed that he had all-but-limitless power will be emboldened by last summer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Supreme Court ruling offering substantial immunity to the commander in chief for official acts taken in office.Trump may also have the chance in the next four years to replace older members of the court, potentially extending until the middle of the century the conservative majority he built in his first term.And as Trump unveils his team of Cabinet members and top West Wing staff, made up largely of ultra loyalists, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s already clear that the 47th president will face few of the restraints that experienced career officials tried to impose on some of his most outlandish schemes when he was the 45th president.Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s team is promising an aggressive first 100-day agenda to enact as much of his \u201a\u00c4\u00faMake America Great Again\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 plan early next year after tapping into the public\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s concern about high prices and undocumented migrants to help the GOP win the White House, the Senate and now the House.Republicans flipped the Senate by defeating Democrats defending red states and, with one outstanding race yet to be projected, they control 52 seats. While the Senate filibuster means that 60 votes are needed to pass most major legislation, party leaders will be able to use the same budgetary devices that helped President Joe Biden pass some big-ticket items.The GOP\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s victory in the House represents a triumph for Speaker Mike Johnson, who struggled to control his restive conference over the last year. The House GOP often plunged into chaos and infighting \u201a\u00c4\u00ee some of which was exacerbated by Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s interventions and the behavior of some of his most outspoken supporters. The narrow majority meant that any one member could decide to stage a revolt or to break with leadership for personal political gain.The question now will be how large next year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s House majority becomes and whether the GOP can widen the margin of a handful of seats that has made managing the conference so complex for Johnson. The fact that Trump will be in the White House with the GOP in full control could make unity easier next year. However, Trump is alreadypoaching from the incoming majorityfor his Cabinet picks, and even with those members hailing from safe Republican seats, their likely vacancies could last long enough to cause headaches for Johnson.Democrats had held out fading hopes in the days after the election that they could flip the House and create a sole bastion against Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s rule \u201a\u00c4\u00ee a feat that looked like a possibility for much of the year given the chamber\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unproductive record and Johnson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s struggle to assert control. Democrats were targeting Republicans sitting in districts that Biden had won four years ago \u201a\u00c4\u00ec many of which were in New York and California \u201a\u00c4\u00ec but with Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s resounding victory this year, some of those seats became harder to pick off.Democrats are now left with the momentous task of regrouping ahead of the midterm elections in 2026 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee without a single platform of power in Washington.Republicans had seized back the House in the 2022 midterm elections to put a brake on Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s term, largely through winning a flurry of those competitive seats in New York and California. Democrats managed to flip several New York seats this year, but Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s relative strength for a Republican presidential candidate in the state of his birth helped limit Democratic gains. Democrats also failed to knock off some other key targets, like GOP Rep. Don Bacon, whose Omaha-area district in Nebraska gave Vice President Kamala Harris an electoral vote. And the GOP captured some of its top targets in Pennsylvania and Michigan.That left the destiny of the House playing out in counts stretching well past Election Day in California, Oregon, Arizona, Iowa and Alaska, among other places.Democrats held on to some of their most competitive seats, however, like that of vulnerable Washington state Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, and were hopeful about others in Ohio and Maine in strong Trump territory.Johnson, who rose from obscurity on the backbenches to the speakership after a party meltdown following the ouster of previous House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in 2023, anchored his strategy to keep the chamber \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and, if possible, enlarge his majority \u201a\u00c4\u00ee on a tight alliance with Trump. The Louisiana Republican traveled to the president-elect\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Mar-a-Lago resort to celebrate on election night and his office has been coordinating closely with the transition team.And on Wednesday, before Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s arrival at a closed-door meeting with House Republicans, Johnson heralded the president-elect as \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe comeback king,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to a source in the room.Trump backed his bid to remain speaker, and the Louisiana Republican was later nominated unanimously by voice vote, two sources in the room told CNN. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll face a House floor vote on January 3.Despite some conservatives pressing Johnson \u201a\u00c4\u00ec on everything from not sending more money to Ukraine to why the GOP didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t win more seats \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the party largely projected unity behind Trump and his backing of Johnson.\u201a\u00c4\u00faIf Donald Trump says jump three feet high and scratch your head, we all jump three feet high and scratch our heads,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 GOP Rep.

He also romped in the Sun Belt battlegrounds, winning Georgia and North Carolina and leading in Arizona and Nevada.CNNRelated cardAnatomy of three Trump elections: How Americans shifted in 2024 vs. 2020 and 2016Trump made gains with nearly every demographic group compared with his 2020 loss,CNN\u2019s exit polls showed. And his apparent near-mirroring of the 2016 map would indicate that he paid no political price for his lies about fraud in that election, his efforts to overturn it, or the criminal charges he has faced since then.He is now poised to return to office with a Republican Senate majority, easing his path to confirming his choices for key government posts. It\u2019s not yet clear which party will control the House.Democrats, meanwhile, will be forced to confront difficult questions about the direction of the party \u2014 on the issues, and on its appeal to critical segments of the electorate, particularly the Latinos whose realignment could reshape American politics.Here are eight takeaways from the 2024 election:Trump undoes the Biden mapThough several states are still tallying their results, Trump\u2019sroad to victory in 2024appears to have been nearly identical to his 2016 win.Both campaigns had long been focused on seven swing states: the \u201cblue wall\u201d of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and the Sun Belt battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada.There were no surprises \u2014 no states that unexpectedly slipped into Trump\u2019s column, despite his musings about winning blue states like New Mexico and Virginia.However, Trump has already claimed Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, and he leads in all seven battlegrounds. In 2020,Joe Bidenhad won six of those seven \u2014 losing only North Carolina to Trump.The final count could take weeks, but Trump also holds the popular vote lead. If that edge holds, he\u2019d be the first Republican since George W. Bush in 2004 to win the popular vote.The \u2018glass ceiling\u2019 remains intactHarris\u2019 loss will once again leave disappointed the millions of women who hoped to see the history-making moment when what Hillary Clinton famously called the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d was shattered.There was a significant gender split, with the majority of women backing Harris, but men supporting Trump, CNN\u2019s exit polls showed.The only segment of the electorate with which Harris made notable gains over Biden\u2019s 2020 performance was with college-educated women \u2014 the voters who had propelled the party\u2019s strong suburban performance in the 2022 midterms.A supporter of Vice President Kamala Harris reacts as election results come in at Harris' watch party at Howard University in Washington, DC.Austin Steele/CNNAbortion rights, the issue that fueled Democratic wins in 2022, on ballot initiatives and in special elections, proved less potent this year.Harris performed much worse than Biden among voters who said they thought abortion should be legal in most cases \u2014 even though the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in between the two elections.Four years ago, 26% of the electorate held that opinion, and Biden won them by 38 points. This year, 33% held that opinion, and Harris won them by just 3 points.It\u2019s a result that suggests the issue wasn\u2019t the deciding factor for many of those voters \u2014 even though Democrats had succeeded in the 2022 midterms, special elections and more by highlighting the GOP\u2019s role in ending Roe v. Wade\u2019s national abortion rights protections.Republicans win the SenateRepublicanswon back the Senate majoritythat they held during Trump\u2019s first term but lost when he was defeated in 2020.The GOP win would have significant ramifications for a new president \u2014easing Trump\u2019s path to having nominees for the Cabinet and other key posts confirmed.Democrats entered the 2024 election cycle with only one or two seats to spare (depending on which party was in the White House, and therefore held the vice president\u2019s tie-breaking vote) \u2014 and an all-but-impossible map to defend, with three seats in deep-red states on the ballot.Republicans won all three of those races. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s retirement effectively guaranteed Republican Jim Justice\u2019s win there. Montana Sen. Jon Tester lost to 38-year-old former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown fell short against businessman Bernie Moreno.Ohio Republican Senate candidate Bernie Moreno during a watch party on election night in Westlake, Ohio.Sue Ogrocki/APDemocrats hoped a long shot would materialize \u2014 crossing their fingers that Rep. Colin Allred could oust Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, or that former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell could buck Florida\u2019s rightward trend and beat Sen. Rick Scott. Neither came close.Three Senate races in the Great Lakes battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were also neck-and-neck. Their outcome will determine the size of the GOP majority.Republicans now face a battle to replace Mitch McConnell as the party\u2019s leader in the chamber, after the Kentucky senator said in February he would step down from his leadership post. Texas Sen. John Cornyn and South Dakota Sen. John Thuneare the two top candidates.Democrats could find some shelter in the HouseDemocrats didn\u2019t want to discuss it before the election, but they\u2019re talking about it now.With Harris\u2019 loss of the presidency and with the Senate coming under GOP control, the House could become the party\u2019s last line of defense in Washington.With so many votes still to be counted and races to be called, it\u2019s hard to say whether House Democrats are on a path to victory or are headed for another close defeat. Democrats have had some good news out of New York and California, which could on their own kick out enough GOP incumbents to make Hakeem Jeffries the next House speaker.What that would mean is, simply, that Trump would be unable to pass much, if any, legislation and perhaps more importantly would find himself hamstrung as he tries to wind back Biden\u2019s policies.Former first lady Melania Trump, former President Donald Trump and Barron Trump at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Wednesday, November 6.Will Lanzoni/CNNRelated articleTrump will win second term, CNN projects, in historic comeback after losing four years agoThe CHIPS Act, a bipartisan law investing in memory chip manufacturing, would be on the chopping block if Republicans keep their majority, but absent that, most would assume it\u2019s off the table. Same goes for any move to uproot the public investments doled out by the Bipartisan Infrastructure and Inflation Reduction acts, which appear safe for the time being.Obamacare, too, would almost surely be in the clear. (Republicans couldn\u2019t repeal it with a governing trifecta in 2017, so talk of repeal might be over anyway.) Though all of these laws \u2013 the signature achievements of the last two Democratic administrations \u2013 seem safe if Democrats get their majority, there will still be tough fights at the administration and agency levels about how they\u2019re managed.But on an otherwise bleak night for Democrats, a fighting chance is the best the party can ask for.Rural voters are an even more potent force than many realizedIf Trump does return to the White House, he will have rural counties across the battleground states to thank.There will be a lot of back-and-forth over why Harris underperformed Biden in big cities and their suburbs, but the fact remains she won in those places mostly by significant margins.Former President Donald Trump speaks at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, on November 6, 2024.Will Lanzoni/CNNRelated articleHere\u2019s what Trump is proposing for the economyStill, Trump\u2019s margins in rural America appear to have been simply too large to overtake. It turns out that there were, in fact, more votes for the former president to mine in counties like central Pennsylvania\u2019s Huntingdon, a short drive from the campus of Penn State University, where he\u2019s on pace to outperform both his vote total and margin from four years ago.Harris\u2019s performance in corresponding strongholds was pretty much the inverse.In Montgomery County, home to a big chunk of the Philadelphia suburbs, Harris is on pace to win about 60% of the vote. The problem for the vice president \u2013 and it\u2019ll be something Democrats spend a lot of time chewing on \u2013 is Biden fared about 2.5 points better than that.There was a similar dynamic on display in Michigan\u2019s Oakland County, too, where Trump again turned out his base and, in some places, added to it, while Harris appears unlikely to match Biden\u2019s 14-point advantage.Small numbers in the grander scheme of an election so big, expensive and plainly complicated could seem negligible \u2013 but they add up. And on Tuesday, the math appeared to be on Trump\u2019s side.Democrats will do some soul searchingWell before the outcome of the presidential election came into view, one thing was crystal clear for Democrats as Tuesday night rolled on: There would be lots of finger-pointing around the party. The results were not just a disappointment at the presidential level. In parts of the country where Democrats won and expected to win, the margin was far from comfortable.Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally at the Alliant Energy Center on October 30 in Madison, Wisconsin.Scott Olson/Getty ImagesRelated articleWhere Harris\u2019 campaign went wrongEven in a scenario where Trump would be able to turn out his base, Democrats thought a surge of support among women voters thanks to an emphasis on abortion rights in races across the country would keep the presidential race close.\u201cAs we have known all along, this is a razor thin race,\u201d wrote Harris campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon in an email at one point in the night.But as the night dragged on, it was not nearly as narrow as Democratic polling and public polling had projected. It became clear to Democrats that they were no longer the party with an ongoing advantage among minority voters and labor unions. And they will have to think about how to win over those constituencies and where they went wrong in messaging and ground game.\u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of critiques and so on,\u201d Democratic strategist David Axelrod said on CNN \u2013 before going on to praise Harris as a candidate despite the results.Trump makes big gains with Latino menTrump\u2019s campaign pushed hard to court men, and particularly men of color. CNN\u2019s exit polls showed it paid off.Chief among Trump\u2019s gains compared with his performance against Biden in 2020: Latino men. Trump won that cohort by 8 points, four years after losing them by 23 points. It\u2019s a result that showed his campaign\u2019s efforts to court those voters paid off \u2014 and that the late focus on acomedian mocking Puerto Ricoat Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally didn\u2019t cause the damage Harris\u2019 campaign hoped it would. The gains were concentrated most heavily among Latinos under age 65.Trump also made gains in key places among Black men, more than doubling his 2020 performance in North Carolina.Former President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the J.S. Dorton Arena on November 4, 2024, in Raleigh, North Carolina.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesOverall, the exit polls painted a picture of an electorate displeased with the state of the nation and its leadership.Nearly three-fourths of voters said they were dissatisfied or angry with the way things are going in the United States, CNN\u2019s exit polls found. Trump won about three-fifths of those voters. Biden was deeply underwater, with 58% of voters saying they disapprove of his performance as president. Four in five of those voters backed Trump.Harris slipped compared with Biden\u2019s performance four years ago among young voters, independents, moderates and union households.Voters who said democracy was the most important issue overwhelmingly backed Harris, but Trump won those who identified the economy as most important by nearly the same margin.Florida and Ohio are no longer battlegroundsFlorida\u2019s decades-long status as a presidential swing state is over.Two years after Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis romped to a 19-percentage-point reelection victory, Trump backed it up with another double-digit GOP win.In heavily Hispanic Miami-Dade County \u2014 traditionally a huge source of Democratic votes \u2014 the massive swing was on full display. What had been a 29-point Hillary Clinton win in 2016 was an 11-point Trump victory this year.Florida even bucked the national trend of states of all political stripes backing abortion rights ballot measures in the two and a half years since Roe v. Wade\u2019s reversal.A majority of Florida voters there backed a ballot measure to legalize abortion, but it fell short of the state\u2019s 60% threshold to win passage \u2014 meaning the state\u2019s six-week ban remains in place.Former President Donald Trump appears with his wife, Melania, and son Barron on stage at his election night watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Wednesday, November 6. \u201cI want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president, and your 45th president,\u201d he told supporters.Will Lanzoni/CNNVice President Kamala Harris deliversher concession speechWednesday at Howard University in Washington, DC. \u201cThe outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for,\" she said. \"But hear me when I say: The light of America\u2019s promise will always burn bright.\"Austin Steele/CNNHarris supporters react during her concession speech at Howard University.Austin Steele/CNNTrump supporters cheer election results in Las Vegas.Ian Maule/APTrump supporters hold up posters that read \"47\" as they attend an election watch party in Chandler, Arizona.Go Nakamura/ReutersHarris supporters watch election results come in at Howard University.Austin Steele/CNNTrump supporters cheer at his election night watch party in West Palm Beach.Will Lanzoni/CNNTrump speaks in West Palm Beach early on Wednesday. \u201cWe have a country that needs help and it needs help very badly,\"he said. \"We\u2019re going to fix our borders and we\u2019re going to fix everything about our country.\"Jeff Roberson/APA Trump supporter reacts to election results during a Republican watch party in Pewaukee, Wisconsin.Vincent Alban/ReutersElection workers review ballots in Denver on Tuesday.Chet Strange/APNorth Carolina A&T students Leah Charles, left, and Tianna Adams attend an election night watch party in Greensboro, North Carolina.George Walker IV/APTrump supporters watch election results come in at his election night party at the Palm Beach County Convention Center.Will Lanzoni/CNNVoting results are posted at the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center in Fairburn, Georgia, on Tuesday.Christian Monterrosa/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesA Harris supporter reacts as election results come in at her watch party at Howard University.Austin Steele/CNNThe Empire State Building in New York is illuminated red, white and blue on Tuesday.Shelby Knowles/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesPeople in West Palm Beach attend Trump's election night watch party.Will Lanzoni/CNNElection observers watch ballots being sorted and counted in Reno, Nevada, on Tuesday.Jason Bean/Reno Gazette Journal/USA Today Network/Imagn ImagesAn American flag is raised at Howard University.Austin Steele/CNNSupporters of Florida's Amendment 4, which would have enshrined abortion rights in the state, react in St. Petersburg, Florida, afterthe amendment's defeat.Rebecca Blackwell/APObservers watch as ballots are scanned in Philadelphia on Tuesday.Leah Millis/ReutersStudents watch election coverage at Spelman College in Atlanta on Tuesday.Brynn Anderson/APVoters stand in line outside a polling place in Phoenix on Tuesday.Matt York/APAlverta Kellaher seals the security envelope of her ballot at the WellSpan York Hospital in York, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday.

I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said in remarks at Howard University, her alma mater, in Washington, DC.In making the remarks, Harris did something her opponent refused to do in the aftermath of the 2020 election: Accept its results.\u201a\u00c4\u00faA fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States, and loyalty to our conscience and to our God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say: While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said.One hundred and eight days after her campaign began, the self-described \u201a\u00c4\u00fajoyful warrior\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 spoke about her loss in determined terms as she sought to reassure the American people.\u201a\u00c4\u00faI know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now. I get it. But we must accept the results of this election,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said.Closing a chapter in the history books after a tense campaign, the vice president offered a call to supporters to \u201a\u00c4\u00faroll up our sleeves\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in response to the election results.Supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris react following Harris' remarks, conceding 2024 U.S. presidential election to President-elect Donald Trump, at Howard University in Washington, DC, on November 6.Hannah McKay/Reuters\u201a\u00c4\u00faDo not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize, and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said in her 12-minute remarks.She vowed to wage that fight \u201a\u00c4\u00fain the voting booth, in the courts, and in the public square,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 as well as in \u201a\u00c4\u00faquieter ways: By treating one another with kindness and respect \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 by always using our strength to lift people up.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9She also sent messages to her more youthful supporters.\u201a\u00c4\u00faTo the young people who are watching, it is okay to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be OK. On the campaign, I would often say, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2When we fight, we win.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 But here\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the thing, here\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the thing, sometimes the fight takes a while.

That doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t mean we won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t win,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe important thing is don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t ever give up. Don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t ever give up. Don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t ever stop trying to make the world a better place,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she continued. \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou have the capacity to do extraordinary good in the world.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9With the glass ceiling still intact, Harris did not directly address the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s failure to reach the historic, barrier-breaking outcome of a female president for the second time, something she largely avoiding highlighting on the campaign trail, rather letting surrogates do the talking for her.But she offered a nod to the moment: \u201a\u00c4\u00faDon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9The speech marked a conclusion to a historic and tumultuous election season that included President Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to step aside following a catastrophic debate performance.

A Democrat who had spoken with her told CNN at the time that she didn\u2019t want to name her differences with PresidentJoe Biden\u2013 including a higher capital gains tax rate, a bigger child tax credit and a tougher border policy \u2013 because she thought it would look disloyal to the man who had picked her as his running mate and then stepped aside for her.The thud fell in a campaign already struggling with a listless October, which had replaced thelate summer exuberanceand aSeptember debatethat nearly every political observer other thanDonald Trumpacknowledged she crushed. As aides new to the Harris orbit exerted control, she struggled with preparation. She grew hesitant, losing some of the confidence and swagger that had defined the early weeks of her reintroduction to the country. Aides who had successfully pushed her out of her comfort zone earlier in the year felt like they were running into the kind of walls she used to put up.CNN spoke with over a dozen senior Harris campaign aides both in the Wilmington, Delaware, campaign headquarters and on the ground in the states, as well as multiple volunteers and local elected officials, over the course of the final weeks of the race.A country crying out for change got a candidate who, at a crucial moment as more voters were tuning in, decided to soft-pedal the change she knew she represented.In the scope of a Democratic ticket that pulled off the biggest turnaround in approval ratings and the fastest consolidation around a new candidate in the history of modern presidential politics, this may have seemed like a minor moment. But it reflected deeper problems: some, like with the staff around her, that she might have been able to adjust; and one, with Biden, that she could never shake, with internal polls showing overwhelming majorities of voters thought the country was on the wrong track.Vice President Kamala Harris makes her way to board Air Force Two before departing Dane County Regional Airport in Madison, Wisconsin on September 20.Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesBy the time Harris got a clearer, sharper contrast answer out on the Biden question, the situation had congealed in ways she never got past \u2013 both among voters wavering in the center who wanted to hear her rebuff the president on his handling of the economy and voters on the left who wanted to hear her more forcefully disavow Biden\u2019s support for Israel.But perhaps the bigger problem with Biden, top Democrats fumed in the aftermath of thatfateful debate in Juneand then again as they watched the results turn red on Tuesday, is that he should have never been anywhere near the 2024 race. If he had stepped aside after the midterms, as some aides urged him to, the Democratic Party process could have played out in a primary campaign. Candidates\u2019 kinks could have been worked out \u2013 or not. Almost certainly whoever emerged as the nominee would have gone into the final weeks without so many Americans complaining they didn\u2019t know enough, as they said about Harris. Biden could have taken on a role as steward and elder statesman, rather than a guy the Harris campaign never knew quite what do with.Late surge of optimism crashesIf the election had been two weeks ago, senior aides to Harris were admitting in recent days, the vice president probably would have lost. But they went into Tuesday feeling like she had gotten herself to a likely squeaker victory. One-on-one conversations volunteers were having as they knocked on doors seemed to be clicking.

Her candidacy sparked in them the unfamiliar feeling of hope.That sentiment evaporated by 11 p.m. on Tuesday. But for many anxious Democrats, this is just the beginning. Going into Election Day, many top Democratic operatives across the campaign and in the states told CNN different versions of the same thought: If this didn\u2019t work \u2013 with the massive campaign they\u2019d put together, with millions of doors knocked by volunteers who flooded into battleground states, withGOP former Rep.

Cory Booker told CNN after a campaign stop late Monday afternoon in Bucks County, Pennsylvania \u2013 one of the key swing districts in the crucial battleground state.The New Jersey Democrat said he had already warned his own staff about not giving up.\u201cWe need to get up the next morning and forge forward,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI told them how much I don\u2019t like hearing people say, \u2018Oh, if so-and-so wins, I\u2019m going to go to Canada. That\u2019s just not our history. We\u2019ve seen really bad outcomes out of bad historical events in our country, and we\u2019re here because of the resiliency, the toughness, the strength of our country \u2014 and people even in the worst of times dug in and tried to do the best for our country.\u201dSimmering internal fights and a revealing pick in WalzHarris\u2019 team would have gladly taken more time to introduce the vice president to the country, or to put together an operation, which, after the ticket switch in July, woke up every morning at campaign headquarters and in the states feeling behind on planning.But by the time the campaign pulled off its multi-state simultaneous rally across battleground states Monday evening \u2013 which ended with Lady Gaga singing her song \u201cThe Edge of Glory\u201d and adding in, \u201cI\u2019m an American woman on the edge\u201d on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art \u2013 a nervous feeling of maybe having made a movement happen was spreading among Harris aides and top supporters.Those aides were a hodgepodge. Biden hadn\u2019t just struggled as a candidate, but had failed to attract some top talent to his campaign because a generation of up-and-coming Democrats could never get excited about him. Harris tried to graft some of her own team onto them, even overlooking tensions between them from the early days of the Biden administration with campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon and keeping her in charge.Former President Donald Trump speaks at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, on November 6, 2024.Will Lanzoni/CNNRelated articleHere\u2019s what Trump is proposing for the economyBut some of those who had been in Wilmington for a year before Harris became the candidate bucked at their new bosses. Alumni of Barack Obama \u2013 most prominently his 2008, campaign manager David Plouffe, but also many others who moved into state operations \u2013 tried to flex a sometimes dated but often more incisive sense of how to win voters.Along the way, multiple aides told CNN how much they were grinding on one another. But the mission to beat Trump and the short timeline to try to get there helped paper over a lot of the infighting that might have exploded in a longer campaign. It instead just raged behind the scenes as aides like Stephanie Cutter moved to exert dominance over defining how and what Harris said what she said.And those tensions manifested from almost the start of this short campaign, in the internal wrangling over who Harris should pick as her running mate. The case for Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was strong, and not just because Harris\u2019 brother-in-law Tony West was telling her they looked like the future of the Democratic Party together, and that the popular governor would make sure she won Pennsylvania. Right-wing media types weren\u2019t the only ones who noticed how much Shapiro had made himself into an Obama clone, as much a Jewish guy from the Philadelphia suburbs could be: The Obama alumni suddenly rushing onto her campaign were pushing for Shapiro.Harrisliked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, though. She liked his line about Republicans being weird. She liked the way he came off as easy and unassuming. She liked the way they\u2019d gotten along in their interview, including his very open stress that he would mess up in a debate with Trump\u2019s running mate,Ohio Sen. JD Vance. And she liked the way Walz had been so deferential to however she would define the job for him.Walz campaigns the day before election day, in West Ellis, Wisconsin, on November 4.Vincent Alban/ReutersIn the end, Harris made a decision that simultaneously reflected her newfound confidence and her long-standing insecurity, solid with trusting her own instincts, fine with going against her family and against the Obama orbit, but also with no interest in having anyone who would possibly outshine her.Then, as top aides kept Harris away from interviews and unscripted moments for weeks longer than many on the campaign thought made sense, Walz was necessarily kept in a box too, so that he didn\u2019t come off more accessible than she was.Tuesday morning, outside a canvas launch in northeast Philadelphia, Shapiro deflected a question about whether Pennsylvania \u2014 and the race \u2014 would have looked different had he been the choice.\u201cI think she made a great pick in Tim Walz,\u201d he said.Democrats try to make sense of gut punchBiden, most Democrats were confident going into Tuesday, would have never even been in contention. The president watched the results come in from the White House, making a few calls to local winning candidates back in Delaware. Some who spoke with him as he made the decision to drop out in July briefly lingered on what might have been \u2013 maybe he could have won by keeping his numbers even in counties where he ended up outperforming Harris, or if he\u2019d lost anyway, at least it wouldn\u2019t have put the burden on a Black woman.

His past behavior doesn\u2019t have to predict the future. But the lesson of Trump\u2019s business and political careers is that he seeks to obliterate all constraints.He has, for instance, crushed opposition in the Republican Party and driven out political heretics who oppose his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d creed. This will be increasingly significant since the GOP has already flipped the Senate and still hopes to complete a monopoly on Washington power by keeping the House, which CNN has not yet projected.No other president has come into office armed with a Supreme Court ruling that grants significant immunity to presidents for official acts. The decision, a direct result of Trump\u2019s effort to challenge his federal indictment for 2020 election meddling, is limited \u2014 but he is certain to take an expansive view of its meaning. The ruling emerged from a conservative court majority fashioned by Trump in his first term and that many legal observers now see as a rubber stamp on future power grabs.A mandatePerhaps most significantly, Trump can claim democratic legitimacy for what is already shaping up as the most intemperate presidency of the modern era, after increasing his vote share across multiple demographics. \u201cEverybody knew this when they voted yesterday. So yes, the American people voted for basically this unchecked power that the president is going to have,\u201d said former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who alienated himself from his party by standing up to Trump following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.Former President Donald Trump poses for a photo with CNN and Warner Bros. Discovery in Atlanta on June 27.John Nowak/CNNRelated articleHow Donald Trump completed a historic political comebackTrump tried to destroy democracy to stay in power after the 2020 election. Four years later, he presented his platform to voters and won an Electoral College majority. He may also bolster his legitimacy by becoming the first Republican president to win the popular vote since 2004.\u201cAmerica has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,\u201d the former and future president said at his Mar-a-Lago victory party early Wednesday.Trump has denied that he wants autocratic power, saying his claim he\u2019d be a dictator on day one is a joke and that he is instead the savior of democracy.Yet millions of Americans chose Trump after his extreme closing argument in which he proposed the biggest deportation operation in US history, mused about using the military against \u201cenemies from within\u201d and vowed to prosecute political opponents and expel Haitian refugees in Ohio who are legally in the country and whom he falsely accused of eating people\u2019s pets.Ignoring legal attempts to hold him to accountTrump\u2019s willingness to wield unchecked executive power will not only be facilitated by his interpretation of the Supreme Court ruling on immunity. He has already subverted constraints on presidential authority. His two impeachments \u2014 over trying to coerce Ukraine with aid and the Capitol insurrection \u2013 didn\u2019t rein in his impulses. And the Republicans\u2019 refusal to convict him in the Senate showed the toothlessness of this crucial constitutional remedy when a political party has chosen to appease an extreme president in return for power.In Trump\u2019s first term, some Republicans sometimes hampered his agenda. The late Arizona Sen. John McCain, for instance, thwarted an attempt to overturn key provisions of the Affordable Care Act with his thumbs down vote. But Trump ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene warned Wednesday that dissent would not be tolerated from GOP members. \u201cI will not let them and neither will the American people who have given us this amazing opportunity to save this country,\u201d the Georgia Republican posted on X.Former President Donald Trump appears in court with his lawyers Todd Blanche, Emil Bove and Susan Necheles for his hush money trial at Manhattan Criminal Court on May 28 in New York City.Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesRelated articleWhat happens to Trump\u2019s criminal and civil cases now that he\u2019s been reelectedKinzinger scoffed at the idea that a GOP Congress would temper Trump. \u201cOn paper, it\u2019s a real thing, in practice no,\u201d the former Illinois lawmaker told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash Wednesday. \u201cThere is no chance, 0.0% chance, that Donald Trump says something and Republicans in the House buck him anymore.\u201dTrump, by winning back the Oval Office, has also evaded the constraints of the law. So, in addition to having the Supreme Court\u2019s immunity ruling in his back pocket, why would he be cowed by the possibility of future legal action against him?Within hours of election night. Special counsel Jack Smith was already talking with the Justice Department about ending two federal prosecutions against Trump \u2014 over his efforts to subvert the 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents \u2014 in line with Office of Legal Counsel curbs on prosecutions of sitting presidents. A state election meddling case in Georgia is now imperiled. And huge doubts also hang over the pending sentencing of Trump after a conviction in a hush money case in New York.Video Ad Feedback'An astonishing result': Elie Honig reacts to Jack Smith potentially ending Trump cases02:04- Source:CNN\u2018The danger is very real\u2019The scope for Trump to stretch historic interpretations of his executive power is immense.\u201cThe danger is very real,\u201d said Corey Brettschneider, professor of politics at Brown University, and author of the book \u201cThe Presidents and the People: Five leaders who Threatened Democracy and the Citizens who Fought to Defend it.\u201d Brettschneider cited Revolutionary War hero Patrick Henry\u2019s disquiet about the possibility that the office of the presidency was so powerful that an incumbent with authoritarian ambitions could ascend an \u201cAmerican throne.\u201d While the founders modeled the presidency on the persona of George Washington, Brettschneider explained that Henry proposed this hypothetical: \u201cWhat if a bad person gets in that office or even a criminal president? And his point is, you know, these supposed checks, because they assume a virtuous person, they\u2019re pretty weak.\u201d Now that America has a convicted felon as its president-elect \u2014 and one who has massive ambitions for his own power \u2014 that\u2019s no longer a hypothetical.Trump has plenty of models for his second term. He has frequently praised foreign autocrats like Russian President Vladimir Putin and China\u2019s Xi Jinping, who face no democratic accountability. He admires the rule of his friend, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who has eroded institutions of accountability, including government departments, the court system and the press. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like him because he\u2019s too strong. It\u2019s good to have a strong man at the head of a country,\u201d Trump reflected at a rally in New Hampshire in January.Trump\u2019s conception of the presidency was encapsulated by his statement in July 2019 that the Constitution gave him untamed power. \u201cI have an Article II, where I have to the right to do whatever I want as president,\u201d he said.  Article II lays out the duties of the presidency \u2014 but it does not, in conventional interpretations, at least, suggest blanket executive authority.Trump\u2019s attitude moved then-federal Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to remark in a 2019 ruling, which ordered compliance by former White House counsel Don McGahn with a congressional subpoena, that \u201cthe primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings.\u201dIt will take time to rein in TrumpSo, are there any constraints?The greatest inhibition to presidential overreach is the sitting president himself, who can chose to remain within bounds of accepted executive action. But self-restraint is a concept alien to Trump. This is not just a personal trait. Such conduct is endemic to his political appeal \u2014 and he was just elected by millions of voters who endorsed his promise to eviscerate a governing system that they believe has failed them. In the past, Trump has sometimes been loath to take steps that might make him politically unpopular \u2014 yet he will take office knowing he does not have to appeal to voters ever again since he\u2019s in his second term.The most effective clamp on Trump\u2019s future power would be a Democratic House majority, which could challenge the new White House with the power of oversight \u2014 even if Trump has already mocked the ultimate sanction of impeachment. But with races still outstanding, Republicans are closer to the 218 seats needed for the majority than Democrats.Then there are the courts. Activist groups are sure to lodge cases against Trump\u2019s immigration moves, as happened over his ban on travelers from certain Muslim nations in his first term. Such maneuvers can tie up a president for months \u2014 although the scores of Trump-appointed judges and the conservative Supreme Court majority may give the administration reprieves.Attempts to prosecute Trump\u2019s political foes on spurious grounds, meanwhile, could theoretically see mass resignations of Justice Department staff. This is one reason why the new administration may roll out plans to sack entire echelons of the civil service to ensure total loyalty to the new president. And the former president is unlikely to make his first-term mistake of appointing officials who confront him \u2013 like former chief of staff John Kelly and former Defense Secretary Mark Esper.Brettschneider argues in his book published this year that an authoritarian president would not present a hopeless situation for US democracy. He examines five commanders in chief who threatened democracy and shows how they spawned protest movements, citizen activism and eventually democratic victories that created restorative presidencies.Still, such responses can\u2019t often halt presidential acts in their commission, meaning that the fate of the country and its democracy often hinges on the president himself. The founders were \u201csitting there in the Constitutional Convention and looking at Washington, and they thought to themselves, \u2018this is a person of virtue. That\u2019s who they had as a model in mind,\u2019\u201d Brettschneider said. \u201cWhen you have somebody who\u2019s not a model of virtue, they can really wreak havoc.\u201dVideo Ad FeedbackRubio says Trump has fundamentally remade the Republican Party.02:17- Source:CNN"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump\u2019s master plan for a radical reformation of the US government", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/07/politics/donald-trump-government-what-matters/index.html", "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter.

It seems to be backed up by some clear planning but there\u2019s a lack of public details.Is there a master plan?During the campaign, Trump tried to distance himself from Project 2025, the controversial and detailed blueprint for a newly reimagined federal government published by conservatives at the Heritage Foundation in anticipation of a second Trump term.While Trump may not want to associate with that plan, it was formulated by his allies \u2013at least 140 people associated with Project 2025worked in Trump\u2019s administration, according to a review by CNN\u2019s Steve Contorno. Certainly there is some overlap between much of what the 900-page Project 2025 proposes and what Trump has said he will do in a series of very simple \u201cAgenda47\u201d videos on his website laying out his plans for a second term.In one Agenda47 video, for instance, Trump promises tohave an executive orderprepared to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants. The14th Amendmentguarantees birthright citizenship, so expect court fights if this happens.One of the policy maestros of Protect 2025, Russell Vought \u2013 who served as the director of the Office of Management and Budget during Trump\u2019s first term \u2013 wascaptured on hidden camera by undercover journalistsover the summer talking about an aggressive agenda he was writing to get Trump\u2019s new administration off to an active start in its first 180 days.On mass deportationsTrump\u2019s most aggressive promise is the rounding up and deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants. Expect Trump to come into office with a series of executive orders already written to reinstate border policies unwound by the Biden administration.Such is the yo-yoing of US immigration policy given that Congress has been unable to pass meaningful reform for decades. What\u2019s not clear is how exactly Trump will go about closing the US border and whether it will include the US military, the National Guard or local law enforcement agencies.Trump\u2019s adviser Stephen Miller said on Fox News to expect deportations to begin the moment Trump is again president on January 20, 2025.CNNRelated REPORTINGAmerica\u2019s red shift: See the counties where Trump boosted his share of the vote\u201cThey begin on Inauguration Day, as soon as he takes the oath of office,\u201d he said.But it\u2019s still not clear exactly how deportations will work. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, a Florida Republican, told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown on Thursday that he expects every undocumented immigrant will continue to get a hearing before he or she is deported, something that will require the hiring of a large number of additional government workers if deportations are amplified to a massive scale. The current process is lengthy.\u201cI agree; it\u2019s going to be a very, very big task,\u201d Gimenez said. \u201cAnd my hope is, and I expect, that we\u2019ll just simply follow the law.\u201dCNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez reported there have already been discussions among Trump allies and some in the private sector to detain and deport migrants at a large scale \u2013 though any operation would come with a big price tag.She noted that Tom Homan, who was acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump\u2019s first term, has said a deportation effort would start with anyone accused of a crime. It\u2019s not clear what would happen to so-called Dreamers, people brought to the US as children who have lived most of their lives here. Some of them are protected by an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that Trump tried unsuccessfully to end during his first term.Video Ad FeedbackEx-ICE official warns about Trump's mass deportation plan02:05- Source:CNNPlans to \u2018aggressively\u2019 fire government workers and move agencies out of DCAt the end of his first term, Trump planned to reclassify a large portion of the federal civilian workforce to make it easier to fire federal workers.

Trump will have aRepublican majority in the Senate, which should ease the confirmation of key positions, but each of the ultimate Cabinet appointees will have a confirmation hearing before they get a vote.Frustrated by the difficulty of getting Cabinet officials confirmed during his first administration, Trump frequently appointed people as \u201cacting\u201d secretaries, although those appointments can only be made on a temporary basis.Trump\u2019s oldest son, Donald Jr., said on Fox News that Trump will prize loyalty and look for \u201cpeople who don\u2019t think that they know better than the duly elected president of the United States.\u201dTaking power away from CongressTrump won\u2019t have the 60 votes he\u2019ll need to shoot sweeping legislation quickly through Congress without bipartisan support in the Senate. It\u2019s not yet clear if Republicans will hold control of the House, but any majority will be slim.One of his big plans to challenge current governing norms that\u2019s gotten less attention is his pledge to seize some power over government spending from Congress. In one Agenda47 video, Trump says he would try to reassert the principle of \u201cimpoundment,\u201d by which a president can reject spending instructions from Congress and use taxpayer money in other ways.Congress reined in presidents with a law after the Nixon administration, but Trump says he will challenge it and take more power for the president."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "What just happened? It was the economy, stupid", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/economy/economy-trump-reelection/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Donald Trump\u2019s decisive election victory was about many things: a global rejection of incumbents, a rise in the Republican electorate and a battle for the future of America\u2019s democracy. But voters consistently and repeatedly said issue No. 1 this election was the economy.That explains a lot about why Trump was reelected.By several major metrics, the US economy ison fire, theenvy of the rest of the world. But Americansstill viewed it unfavorably, and a significant number of voters blame President Joe Biden and Trump\u2019s opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, for failing to make enough improvements to Americans\u2019 financial situations over the past four years. Poll after poll suggested that Americans hold largely negative views about the US economy.That\u2019s because economic sentiment doesn\u2019t always match up nicely with data that shows the economy is adding jobs, consumer spending is growing and gross domestic product \u2014 the broadest measure of the economy \u2014 continues to boom. When you pay through the nose for a cup of coffee or when you can\u2019t afford to buy a home, those data are meaningless: You feelshut out of the American Dream.Why the US economy stings so muchHousing:America\u2019s home prices have reached new record highs for 15 straight months. That\u2019s great news if you own a home \u2014 and not so great if you don\u2019t, especially with mortgage rates remaining stubbornly high, just below 7%. That\u2019s why a record low 2.5% of homes switched owners this year, thelowest in 30 years, according to Redfin.Rent isn\u2019t offering much relief: About half of American rentersshelled out more than 30% of their incomeon rent in 2023. Households that spend more than 30% of their income on rent, mortgage payments or other housing costs are considered \u201ccost-burdened\u201d by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.The housing affordability crisis has helped exacerbate America\u2019s wealth gap, leaving people who are forced to move or don\u2019t own a home in a financial bind. But many people who are hardly poor are also struggling to get by, largely because of how much it costs to live in a home: A fifth of US households that earn more than $150,000 a year are living paycheck to paycheck, according to aBank of America survey.Prices:Inflation is back to normal. But that doesn\u2019t mean prices are falling \u2014 they\u2019re just not rising at the alarming level they were a couple of years ago.Prices are roughly 20% higher now than they were when Biden took office, leaving Americans with a daily reminder of how much inflation stinks every time they go to the store. Gas prices have fallen dramatically over the past couple of years, sinking from a record average high of above $5 in 2022 to below $3 a gallon in many states now. That has helped, but not solved, the inflation problems many Americans continue to face on a daily basis.Politics:A lot of how you feel about the economy depends on your politics. And the number of registered Republicans in America is growing.A recent studyfrom the Brookings Institution, released last week, found a correlation between economic sentiment and political affiliation with the party in control of the White House. When Trump took office, Republican economic sentiment surged, while Democratic sentiment cratered. The opposite happened when Biden took office.But Republicans are three times more likely to think the economy is good when a Republican is in office than Democrats when a Democrat holds the White House \u2014 and the reverse is true, too.No, really, the US economy is greatStill, Trump will be inheriting a strong economy \u2014 on paper, anyway.Jobs:The biggest indicator of economic security is whether or not you have a job, and a historically high percentage of people do. Even though the unemployment rate has been ticking higher over the past year, at 4.1%, it remains at a very healthy level, rising incrementally from the lowest unemployment rate since the first moon landing.The US economy\u2019s job-creation machine has slowed this year \u2014 particularly in recent months. Last month, the economy added just 12,000 jobs. Still, the economy is continuing to add a monthly average of 170,000 jobs this year, which is almost exactly the number the economy added during the first three years of the Trump administration, before Covid hit (175,000 jobs per month).Companies are still clamoring so much for workers that the number of job listings is greater than the number of American job seekers, according the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.GDP:The broadest measure of the US economy is booming.Gross domestic productgrew at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 2.8% last quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Wednesday. That\u2019s a healthy pace by any measure, and it\u2019s on par with the economic expansion during the Trump administration, when people were feeling much better about the state of the economy.It has also made America\u2019s economy the envy of the world: Projected US economic growth for this year remains the strongest of any of the G7 economies, according to the International Monetary Fund.Paychecks:Workers\u2019 paychecks aren\u2019t booming like they were a couple years ago when inflation was truly off the rails. But they\u2019re still growing at a 3.9% adjusted rate, according to the Depart\ufeffment of Labor. That\u2019s still a faster clip than inflation, which means the amount of money Americans have to spend is growing.Inflation-adjusted disposable income per capita rose for the 27th straight month, according to the BEA, the longest streak on record.Consumerism:Despite polls to the contrary, consumers are acting like the economy is great. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of America\u2019s economy, is surging, rising 3.7% last quarter, the highest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2023, according to the BEA.And consumerconfidence is on the rise, too \u2014 it surged in October by the largest amount in any survey since March 2021. Still, it remains well below where it was before the pandemic, during Trump\u2019s first term."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump\u2019s return to power raises serious questions about the media\u2019s credibility", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/media/trump-reelection-media-credibility-trust/index.html", "content": "New YorkCNN\u2014Donald Trump\u2019s return to power is a hinge point for the American media \u2013 in ways big, small, and to be determined.

Some of the questions might not be answerable for years.But journalists are asking each other: What does this \u201cred wave\u201d election say about the information environment in the United States?In the hours after Trumpwon reelectionTuesday, some of his loyalists asserted that his victory is a complete repudiation of the news media.

They believe the national news media is a big part of what ails America. Not only do they distrust what they read, they often don\u2019t read it in the first place. Can anything be done to change that?A quote in a recent New Yorkmagazine columnchanneled that question. The quote, from an anonymous TV executive, was recirculated on social media Wednesday morning. \u201cIf half the country has decided that Trump is qualified to be president, that means they\u2019re not reading any of this media, and we\u2019ve lost this audience completely,\u201d the executive said. \u201cA Trump victory means mainstream media is dead in its current form.

A severe trust deficit exists between the Trump base and big institutional media outlets. In a text message, a Trump campaign aide suggested that the press should show more humility.That raises another question: Do major networks and publications have enough columnists and commentators who reflect the Trump majority\u2019s views?\u201cMaybe we have a point,\u201d the aide remarked. \u201cMaybe \u2018misinformation\u2019 is a lazy word that was never applied to press coverage of Biden\u2019s health or the border.

He said Trump\u2019s win was \u201csomething of an indictment of the political information complex.\u201d\u201cWe have been sitting around for the last couple weeks and the story that was portrayed was not true,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cWe were told Puerto Rico was going to change the election. Liz Cheney, Nikki Haley voters, women lying to their husbands. Before that it was Tim Walz and the camo hats. Night after night after night we were told all these things and gimmicks were going to somehow push Harris over the line. And we were just ignoring the fundamentals. Inflation; people feeling like they are barely able to tread water at best; those were the fundamentals of the election.\u201dJennings added: \u201cI think for all of us who cover elections and talk about elections and do this on a day-to-day basis, we have to figure out how to understand talk to and listen to the half of the country that rose up tonight and said, \u2018We have had enough.\u2019\u201dLiberal commentator Ashley Allison responded: \u201cI think we have to listen to everybody, actually.\u201d She said, \u201cthe people who voted for Kamala Harris are struggling too. They are feeling ignored too. A Republican\u2019s pain is no greater or less than a Democrat\u2019s pain.\u201dWhat lies ahead for the pressIf history is any guide, Trump is never, ever satisfied with news coverage. He always wants a more pliant, propagandistic media. He even complains about Fox News on a regular basis, despite the network\u2019s overwhelming support for him. Last month, he complained to Fox patriarch Rupert Murdoch about the network airing Democratic ads.Thus, Trump\u2019s reelection portends a new period of hostility with major media outlets that strive for impartiality as well as partisan outlets that oppose him. This raises another set of questions.Will the Trump administration turn his words against the press into actions? Will he move to revoke licenses for TV stations, as he has suggested more than a dozen times this year? Will he limit press access to the White House, barring reporters he doesn\u2019t like?Further, will media outlets engage in self-censoring to appease Trump, and if so, how will readers and viewers who oppose Trump react?On Wednesday morning, newsroom leaders and owners are reassuring employees that they will have their backs in the uncertain months to come. \u201cNow, more than ever, we are steadfast in our mission to uphold the principles of independent journalism,\u201d Conde Nast chief Roger Lynch wrotein a memoto staffers. \u201cA thriving, independent press, as protected by the First Amendment, is vital to democracy and the future we all share.\u201d"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump\u2019s win was real but not a landslide.

The final 2024 popular vote tally likely won\u2019t be known until December.CNNRelated articleAmerica\u2019s red shift: See the counties where Trump boosted his share of the voteWhen he lost convincingly in 2020, Trump got a little more than 74 million votes. So while it\u2019s true that much of the country moved to the right in this election, it\u2019s also true that there was some voter apathy if, at the end of the day, turnout is down from 2020.That doesn\u2019t mean this will end up being a low turnout election. The University of Florida Election Lab estimates as of Friday thatturnout in 2024will be about 62.3% of the voting-eligible population, down from the high-water mark of the modern era of more than66.4% in 2020but still above other recent elections. Turnout in 1996 and 2000 was not much over 50% of the voting-eligible population.In terms of the Electoral College, Trump won 312 electoral votes. It\u2019s a solid win, but in the lower half of US presidential elections.It was a better showing than either his or Joe Biden\u2019s 306 electoral votes in 2016 and 2020, respectively. It also outperformed both of George W. Bush\u2019s electoral victories in 2000 and 2004. But it was far short of Barack Obama\u2019s 365 electoral votes in 2008 and 332 in 2012.Bill Clinton never reached 50% in the popular vote because both of his presidential elections featured a strong third-party candidate in Ross Perot. But Clinton did run away with the Electoral College vote, winning 370 electoral votes in 1992 and 379 in 1996.Even those strong victories are dwarfed by Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1984 win, a true landslide. Reagan lost only Washington, DC, and Minnesota, the home state of his Democratic rival, Walter Mondale, thereby securing 525 electoral votes and more than 58% of the popular vote.BothRichard Nixon in 1972andLyndon B. Johnson in 1964exceeded 60% in the popular vote for their reelection campaigns, something that seems impossible in today\u2019s political climate. It\u2019s also incredible to think that two such massive landslides would occur within eight years. Nixon\u2019s reelection rival in 1972, then-Sen. George McGovern, lost even his home state of South Dakota and won only Massachusetts and Washington, DC.Voters were much more likely to split their tickets in those years. While Johnson, a Democrat, enjoyed a strong Democraticmajority in the Houseafter his 1964 landslide, voters who gave both Nixon and Reagan all but one state also checked them with a Democratic-controlled House.The more recent trend is for voters to align their votes for House, Senate and the White House. That trend has led to a period during which the White House and Congress change hands more frequently, although Democrats will keep Senate seats in multiple states won by Trump this year.Trump\u2019s 2024 win marks the third straight presidential election in which voters have thrown out the incumbent party. The last time that happened in three straight elections was in the late 1800s whenGrover Clevelandbecame the first president to be elected to nonconsecutive terms. Trump is the second.Trump will never be on a presidential ballot again, because the 22nd Amendment limits presidents to two terms. But voters will get an opportunity to weigh in on how he and Republicans use their power in two years, during the 2026 midterm elections.The past three presidents, including Trump in his first term, all lost control of the House after their first two years in office. If Trump does end up with a friendly Republican majority this year, he\u2019ll have to work hard to keep voters on his side two years from now.This story has been updated with additional developments."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "The common national experience that explains Trump\u2019s 2024 gains", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/trump-wide-gains-2024-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014The most impressive aspect ofDonald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris last week was the uniformity of his gains across the electoral landscape.But paradoxically, the very magnitude of his gains may offer Democrats their best hope of recovery in the next few elections. The across-the-board nature of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s improvement suggests that his victory wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t primarily driven by the two campaigns\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 tactical choices, messaging decisions or advertising strategies.Trump gained ground in urban, suburban and rural counties and improved on his vote share, as of the latest counts, in 49 of the 50 states.A preliminary CNN analysisconcluded that Trump ran better than he did in 2020 in fully 9 in 10 of the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s counties where results are available.Those sweeping gains document how much ground Democrats lost this year \u201a\u00c4\u00ee not only in places where they were bracing for further retreat (including both in rural communities and urban centers) but also the racially diverse, well-educated suburbs that had earlier keyed the resistance to Trump. Those losses leave Democrats in a weaker electoral position, in most respects, at the start of the second Trump presidency than at the outset of his first.But the scale of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s advance this year points toward a common national experience in all regions of the country \u201a\u00c4\u00ee a shared disappointment in the results generated by PresidentJoe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s administration, primarily on inflation, but secondarily around other issues led by immigration and crime. The evidence that the outcome was driven largely by a negative verdict on Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s performance underscores the possibility that Democrats could recover sooner than now seems possible if Americans one day conclude that Trump hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t delivered the better results he has promised.A flag is left at an event held by Vice President Kamala Harris at Howard University in Washington, DC, on November 6, 2024.Daniel Cole/ReutersRelated articleStill-stunned Democrats begin to squint toward their futureThe consistency of the Democratic decline this year \u201a\u00c4\u00fareflects a very broad sense of discontent across many different demographic groups, across every major population group, with the direction of the country under Biden,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz. Trump and the GOP, he said, face the same risk of reversal if the president-elect pursues some of the policies that voters remained uneasy about even as they voted for him \u201a\u00c4\u00ee especially if he can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t ease the cost-of-living squeeze that drove much of this year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s result.Experts agree that factors beyond disappointment in the Biden administration\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s outcomes also influenced the results. These ranged from a widening cultural gap between Democrats and Latinos, especially men, to continuing resistance among some voters to entrusting the presidency to a woman, to the GOP\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s successful efforts to portray Harris as an extremist cultural liberal largely through attacks on views about transgender issues she expressed during her 2020 presidential campaign.But more targeted dynamics can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t explain a shift as comprehensive as the one the country experienced last week. Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 loss, as a quasi-incumbent, followed a well-established pattern: When an outgoing president faces widespread discontent over his performance, his party has almost always failed to hold the White House in the election to succeed him. (That dynamic applied when Democrats Harry Truman in 1952 and Lyndon Johnson in 1968 stepped down rather than seek reelection, and again in 2008 with Republican George W. Bush leaving office after his two terms.)\u201a\u00c4\u00faPeople struggle to find explanations for what is going on with Hispanic men, or with young people, but the most common explanation [to all of them] is the right one,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck, the co-author of well-respected books on the 2016 and 2020 elections. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNobody thinks things are going well, and if you are the incumbent you own that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Two sophisticated new geographic analyses of the results underscore just how powerful and pervasive the movement toward Trump was this year. One comes fromthe Daily Yonder websitepublished by the nonpartisan Center for Rural Studies.The center has developed a system that categorizes the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s roughly 3,100 counties into six categories from the most urban (major metro core counties) to the most rural (nonmetropolitan counties). In between, the center divides counties into the categories of suburbs of those major cities; medium-sized cities; the suburbs of those medium-sized cities; small communities; and the rural, nonmetropolitan counties.President Donald Trump arrives to speak during an election night event at the Palm Beach Convention Center on November 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Florida.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesANALYSISTrump is already wielding power and causing massive disruptionAccording to the preliminary analysis of the election results the group provided to me, Trump gained in all six kinds of counties \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and by strikingly similar amounts. Trump improved his vote by 4 percentage points in each of the two most populous categories \u201a\u00c4\u00eethe major metro core counties and their suburbs \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and by 3 percentage points in each of the other four groupings of smaller places.This was a more consistent rise than the center has recorded across the spectrum of urban-rural counties in any recent election. From 2004 to 2008, Barack Obama improved on John Kerry\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s performance in all six kinds of counties, but Obama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gains varied more \u201a\u00c4\u00ee from about 3 points in the smallest places to roughly double that in the largest. From 2008 to 2012, Obama improved slightly in the three groupings of largest places but lost ground in the three smaller categories. In 2016, Hillary Clinton ran better than Obama in the largest places, but Trump ran far better than Mitt Romney, the GOP\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2012 nominee, in the smaller ones.Tellingly, the closest recent comparison to Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s uniform gains this year was Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4sperformance four years ago. Biden improved on Clinton\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s share of the vote by between 1.5 to 2 percentage points in all of the center\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s categories of midsized counties, and by 0.5 points in the two poles of their scale: the very largest urban centers and the smallest rural places.Biden in 2020did not gain ground across the countryin as large a percentage of counties as Trump did in 2024. But, as the center\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s data showed, Biden then, like Trump now, improved quite consistently across the map, from the most urban to the most rural places.Abramowitz says the state-level results send a similar message about how much Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s electoral recovery this year resembles his decline four years earlier. In 2020, five states flipped from Trump to Biden; in 2024, they all flipped back to Trump (as did Nevada, which narrowly backed Biden four years ago). In 2020, Biden won Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,the three former \u201a\u00c4\u00fablue wall\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 statesthat decided the election, by a combined 257,029 votes. As of last weekend, Trump led in those three states, all of which he won, by a combined margin of 256,940 votes.In all, Biden in 2020, according to the CNN analysis, improved over Clinton\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s showing four years before in 42 states. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not as many as moved toward Trump this year; but both elections, Abramowitz noted, look quite different from the much more mixed results of 2016, when Trump improved on the GOP\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2012 performance in 38 states but lost ground in 13 others.Vavreck said Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first election in 2016 produced a lasting ideological and demographic \u201a\u00c4\u00fareshuffling\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that moved states with large populations of non-college White voters (such as Iowa and Ohio) toward the GOP while cementing the Democratic advantage in diverse and well-educated states that became light blue during the Obama years (Colorado and Virginia).But since then, she said, the similarly uniform shift away from Trump in 2020 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and then back toward him in 2024 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee points toward voter assessments of performance, rather than big further ideological shifts, as the main driver of the results. Just as Trump, as the incumbent, suffered from a negative verdict on his performance in 2020, Harris, as the quasi-incumbent successor to Biden, suffered from a negative verdict on the president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s performance four years later.Former President Donald Trump holds a news conference from inside trash hauler at the airport in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on October 30, 2024.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesRelated articleWe asked Americans what they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d heard about Trump and Harris throughout the campaign. Here\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what they told us\u201a\u00c4\u00faA lot of that is kind of pure retrospective voting: Things are not going well, so kick the incumbent out,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Vavreck said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn 2020, Biden picks up everywhere. Now we look from \u201a\u00c4\u00f420 to \u201a\u00c4\u00f424 and the Democrats are losing [ground] everywhere.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9A second new geographic analysis of the 2024 election results also underscores the comprehensive nature of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gains. The center-left Brookings Metro think tank for several years has correlated the election results with federal data that records how much each county contributes to the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s total economic output.Those analyses consistently have foundthat Democrats now dominate the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highest-output counties, which tend to be large metro areas that have transitioned the fastest into the 21st century information-age economy. Republicans, meanwhile, run best in places generally on the outskirts of the major metro areas that are more dependent on the powerhouse industries of the 20th century: agriculture, energy extraction and manufacturing.The group\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s new analysisshows those divisions largely holding this year.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe first thing to say is that the country remains extremely divided economically,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro who directs this research. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t changed.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9But the results this year also show Trump establishing what Muro called a \u201a\u00c4\u00fatoehold\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most productive metro areas, particularly across the Sun Belt. In 2020, Trump won just five of the 100 counties that contributed the most to the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s overall economic output, while Biden carried an astounding 95. This year, Trump has already won 17 of the 100 most productive counties and Harris 78 (with five still to be called).Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gains in those very high-output counties, as well as his success in flipping at least another roughly 70 counties from blue to red, has dramatically increased the share of national economic output contributed by the places that support him. In 2020, Biden won only a little more than one-sixth of the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s counties, but the places he captured generated over 70% of the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s total economic output. This year, Trump has already won counties that account for 40% of the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s economic output (with 161 counties still to be called at the time Brookings conducted this analysis late last week).The highest-output counties Trump flipped were almost entirely in the Sun Belt: from Hillsborough (Tampa) and Tarrant (Fort Worth) to Maricopa (Phoenix).Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recapture of Maricopa was especially dramatic, after Biden in 2020 became the first Democratic presidential nominee to carry the county since Truman in 1948.Muro says Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gains in high-output metros across the Sun Belt, like his support fromElon Muskand other conservative Silicon Valley leaders, show Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s potential to establish a beachhead in new-economy bastions that almost all viewed him with suspicion during his first term. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is the sort of the leading edge of the Trump governing base that now has picked up a number of significant economic centers in addition to its literally thousands of small-town and rural places,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Muro said.The question, Muro said, is whether Trump can preserve that beachhead while pursuing policies he pledged,such as the mass deportationof undocumented immigrants, sweeping tariffs, rescinding theBiden-passed incentives for clean energyand possibly also semiconductor manufacturing, and potentially moving to restrict civil rights and liberties. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Trump agenda,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Muro said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fadoes not seem like one conducive to maximizing the output of the country and particularly the dense blue metros.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Donald Trump talks to reporters at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters headquarters in Washington, DC, on January 31, 2024.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesRelated articleWhy Trump surged in New York, but House Democrats succeeded in the stateMuro\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s question about the high-output metros applies more broadly: While disappointment with Biden provided a huge lift for Republicans last week, moving forward Trump will need to sustain support on the strength of his own agenda, leadership style and results.The exit pollsconducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN,as well as the VoteCast studydone by NORC in partnership with the Associated Press and other media organizations, made clear that even as voters returned Trump to the Oval Office, many of them retained doubts about his agenda and personal style. Across the two studies, a majority of voters described Trump as \u201a\u00c4\u00fatoo extreme\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and likely to steer the US toward authoritarianism, while majorities also expressed opposition to his mass deportation plan; majorities also indicated support for legal abortion and a greater government role in ensuring health care coverage for Americans.The surveys made clear that those concerns were submerged by the towering discontent with the results of the Biden presidency. In the exit polls, about three-fifths of voters said they disapproved of Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s performance, and two-thirds described the economy in negative terms. About 80% of the voters who disapproved of Biden voted for Trump, as did about 70% of those who expressed negative views about the economy, the exit polls found.As a result of those cross-cutting pressures, a critical share of voters who expressed concerns about Trump or his agenda in the two surveys voted for him anyway: For instance, one-fourth of women who described themselves as supporting legal abortion in the exit polls still voted for Trump. So did about one-fourth of Latinos who said in the exit polls they opposed mass deportation. About 1 in 8 voters who described Trump as too extreme, or said he would lead the US toward authoritarianism, likewise backed him anyway.Vavreck said it should be surprising that even many voters resistant to elements of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s agenda prioritized more immediate concerns \u201a\u00c4\u00ee particularly their frustration over the cost of living, as well as issues such as the border and crime. Those frustrations created an almost insuperable barrier for Harris.But in a little over two months, Trump, once again, will be the incumbent. And in Vavreck\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s phrase,heand his party will own the results of the coming years. If Americans feel he has made progress on the problems they elected him to solve, he will likely maintain a strong position. But if they feel he has not, or if they conclude he has created new problems with his policies, there could be a turn away from Trump and the GOP in the 2026 and 2028 elections that is just as uniform as the movement toward them last week."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Anatomy of three Trump elections: How Americans shifted in 2024 vs. 2020 and 2016", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/politics/2020-2016-exit-polls-2024-dg/", "content": ""}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "We asked Americans what they\u2019d heard about Trump and Harris throughout the campaign.

It may, in fact, suggest some limits as to how much a siloed news environment can affect vote choice in an election wherepartisans often divergedin their recounting of current events and where roughly 8 in 10 voters said in exit polling that they made up their minds sometime prior to September.But the project, conducted by SSRS and Verasight on behalf of a research team from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, provides one account of how the nation experienced the campaign. In the abbreviated race between Harris and Trump, the research found, the single presidential debate between the two nominees in September was perhaps the last campaign event to draw truly universal attention.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgGeorgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgWhat also stands out in the charts over time is the lack of a sustained narrative about either candidate. That partially echoes 2016, when researchers found that \u201a\u00c4\u00fathere was no single persistent negative theme that emerged when we asked people daily what they had read, seen or heard about Trump.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 That, Gallup\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Frank Newportwrote four years ago, \u201a\u00c4\u00fareflected his campaign\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ability to define news coverage through attention-getting tactics that defied existing norms of political decorum, and the inability of the opposing campaign \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 to come up with a powerful negative narrative to use against him.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9But the parallels to 2016 are far from absolute. In 2024, while no single story stuck to Trump, the overarching word \u201a\u00c4\u00falie\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 did, reaching the top five words associated with him in all but one week of the election\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s final two months. And notably, while impressions of Hillary Clinton in 2016 were consistently dominated by stories about her emails, no topic \u201a\u00c4\u00ec positive or negative \u201a\u00c4\u00ec filled a similar role for Harris in 2024.On average, over the 20 weeks The Breakthrough survey was fielded this year, roughly 76% of US adults said weekly they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d heard at least some news about Trump. In the 15 full weeks of data following Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 entry into the race, a slightly smaller share \u201a\u00c4\u00ec about 71% on average \u201a\u00c4\u00ec said they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d heard something about her. There was less of a disparity in the final week of the campaign when roughly three-quarters of Americans reported reading, hearing or seeing at least something about each candidate \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 76% for Trump and 74% for Harris.Those numbers also suggest that the scope of the public\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attention actually narrowed as the calendar moved further into the fall. In July, the share who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d heard news about Trump topped out at 89% following the first assassination attempt against him, while the share hearing about Biden peaked at 84% in the wake of his presidential debate performance and subsequent decision to leave the race. The share with something to say about Harris never rose higher than the 77% she hit in mid-August.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgThat pattern \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a peak focus during the summer and a decline during the election\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s final days \u201a\u00c4\u00ec also stands out from the past two elections. In 2020, the share of voters reporting they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d heard news about Trump and Biden rose modestly but mostly steadily throughout the fall; attention in 2016 was more sporadic but peaked in mid-October.The Breakthrough project also tracked the sentiment of survey responses \u201a\u00c4\u00ec that is, not the feelings Americans expressed about the candidates personally, but whether the terms and tone they used to frame what they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d heard tended to be more positive or negative. In the first months after Harris entered the race, her sentiment score was more positive than Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s, the poll found. But that distinction largely faded in the last month of the campaign. Although Harris saw a small uptick in the final week before Election Day, sentiment scores for both candidates remained well under water.Sentiments expressed by political independents when talking about the news surrounding Trump were negative throughout the campaign. Their sentiment when discussing what they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d heard about Harris, which was close to neutral at the start of her candidacy, declined modestly throughout the fall, undercutting her advantage over Trump on that metric.CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Jennifer Agiesta and Edward Wu contributed to this report."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "How Donald Trump completed a historic political comeback", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/how-donald-trump-won/index.html", "content": "West Palm Beach, FloridaCNN\u2014Donald Trump beganhis political comebackwhen many in his own party wanted him to go away.He announced his third White House bid days after Republicans underwhelmed in the 2022 midterm elections, a performance that prominent GOP figures laid squarely at his feet \u2014 for the candidates he supported, for lingering resentments over the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and for his unwillingness to recede from public lifein the aftermath of defeat.Surrounded at Mar-a-Lago by the close allies and aides that had yet to abandon him during his post-presidency exile, Trump assigned blame elsewhere, including the justice system that had raided his Palm Beach estate three months prior. He offered a dark assessment of the country after he left office and forecasted that before longvoters would turn against those in charge.\u201cI have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse, and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand the voting will be much different.\u201dBy early Wednesday morning, Trump\u2019s prediction had materialized. Millions of Americans, including pivotal voters in Midwest and Sun Belt battlegrounds, cast ballots that clinched Trump\u2019s historic comeback \u2014 one that promises to reshape American politics for the foreseeable future.Trump\u2019s victory, years in the making,is as notable for its breadth as for its method. His campaign aimed from the outset to remake the political coalitions that have underpinned American elections for generations. Trump reached out to constituencies traditionally loyal to Democrats: union households, wage workers, and Black and Latino men.At the same time, he courted the disillusioned \u2014 men scattered throughout America\u2019s forgotten places who had long given up on electoral politics altogether. And his allies exploited rifts between Democrats and their base of support. A Republican-tied super PAC, for example, aired ads on Detroit radio urging the area\u2019s Arab voters to support Green Party candidate Jill Stein over the Democratic ticket due to the Mideast conflict.Simultaneously, the Republican Jewish Coalition spent $15 million targeting Jewish voters anxious over the administration\u2019s support for Israel and the left\u2019s embrace of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses.Preliminary data suggests his team achieved even more than they anticipated. Trump\u2019s apparent gains among younger voters surpassed the rosiest of projections. When all the votes are counted, Trump appears likely to become the first Republican since 2004 to win the popular vote as well as the Electoral College.\u201cThe most important thing and what should inform what happens with the party moving forward: He built a broad and diverse coalition,\u201d senior adviser Brian Hughes said Wednesday morning just as Trump took the stage to delivery victory remarks. \u201cAnd now the exit polling reflects it.\u201dA stable group of campaign aides and a consistent messagePeople within and close to Trump\u2019s political operation credit his victory to a host of factors, not the least of which was a campaign that, from the start, appeared far more sophisticated and disciplined than its two predecessors. They argued that the campaign leadership, led by Florida guru Susie Wiles and veteran Republican operative Chris LaCivita, helped instill a sense of control over the candidate that extended to the Republican Party and helped counteract Trump\u2019s proclivity to get in his own way.The two managed to serve as the former president\u2019s campaign heads for the entire cycle \u2014 unheard of in Trump world \u2014 and kept the fringe influences within his orbit at bay.\u201cSusie and Chris have held it together,\u201d one longtime Trump confidant told CNN.But the scale of Trump\u2019s win points to forces at work beyond any single campaign maneuver or specific moment in a race marked by many unprecedented events, including multiple attempts on the Republican\u2019s life and the abrupt exit of Democratic President Joe Biden.Rather, the outcome reflects the very scenario Trump foreshadowed two years earlier: An American public beset by inflation, frustrated by years of immigration mismanagement and ultimately prepared to pivot away from the party in power \u2014 even if it meant putting the executive branch back in the hands of an unpopular, twice-impeached ex-president whose failed attempts to remain in office ended in a bloody riot in the nation\u2019s capital.For Vice President Kamala Harris, saddled with the baggage of an unpopular incumbent and sour views about the US economy, the race proved challenging, and her scramble to demonstrate her readiness for the role Trump once held ultimately fell short for enough Americans to tip the scales.Video Ad FeedbackLatino voters from battleground states react to Trump win01:34- Source:CNNSkeptics in and outside of the GOP proved wrongYet, skeptics within the GOP remained and cast doubt as to whether enough Americans would ever again turn to Trump to lead the country.A lineup of former allies, including Trump\u2019s first vice president, Mike Pence; ex-political protege Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis; and former ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, set out to test that case, even as the former president made clear he intended to seek the Oval Office once more. For a time, it appeared there was an opening for those candidates to pull the GOP from Trump\u2019s vise grip.Trump enraged his close allies by dining with a known neo-Nazi in the days following the launch of his presidential campaign, and his threat shortly after to terminate the Constitution sent his political team \u2014 and his public support \u2014 spiraling. The episode marked a low point, Wiles would later tell The Atlantic, leading to an ominously dark Christmas in Palm Beach. Wiles recalled Trump asked her during that stretch, \u201cDo you think I would win Florida?\u201dThen came a series of state and federal indictments targeting Trump\u2019s businesses, his failed attempts to maintain power and droves of White House documents he allegedly took with him to Mar-a-Lago. The response from Republican voters was almost instantaneous. With each new case came a wave of donations and renewed support from the politicians who had left his side.His Republican rivals, already straining to criticize Trump without alienating the GOP faithful, were stuck. All through 2023, Trump refused to attend a single Republican primary debate, leaving his opponents to fight among each other to establish themselves as an alternative.Trump\u2019s political team seized on their change in fortune, selling T-shirts with his mug shot and consolidating support throughout the country. Meanwhile, they set out to build a political machine that would pale in comparison to the disorganized and wayward operations of his first two campaigns.The first test came in Iowa. The campaign recruited and trained around 2,000 volunteer caucus captains across the state. Each was assigned a mission: Get commitments from 10 first-time voters in the Iowa caucuses from a list of 25 prospective supporters the campaign had identified in their neighborhoods.On January 15, Trump captured support from 51% of Iowa caucusgoers, leaving a wide chasm between him and the rest of the field. From there, Trump marched to the GOP nomination, losing only the Vermont and Washington, DC, primaries.Still, Haley had exposed lingering discomfort with Trump among some moderate Republicans, especially suburban women who had turned against the former president almost immediately after his 2017 inauguration.A new tactic for the general electionTrump\u2019s team concluded early that the economy and external forces were more likely to dictate how those voters viewed their decision in 2024 than any outreach he or they could make. Instead, his operatives set out to replace their support by building a new coalition across the battleground states most likely to decide the presidential election.He promised Libertarians a cabinet spot, and to Bitcoin enthusiasts he vowed to install a pro-crypto administration. He made repeated overtures to Michigan autoworkers. He held a rally in the Bronx geared toward Black and Latino voters. He visited deeply blue parts of the country, convinced expanding his efforts outside the traditional battleground map could put the popular vote within reach.Along the way he dangled financial incentives to key groups: no taxes on tipped wages to service workers in Nevada; no taxes on overtime wages for blue-collar workers; no taxes on Social Security for seniors. Mostly, he sought to convince each group that the flow of migrants through the US southern border threatened their jobs, safety and way of life.Former President Donald Trump poses for a photo with CNN and Warner Bros. Discovery in Atlanta on June 27.John Nowak/CNNHe also sat down for lengthy interviews with an emerging media ecosystem of male influencers and podcast hosts \u2014 comedians, athletes, pranksters and Joe Rogan \u2014 who his campaign believed touched men of all stripes, from the investor class to the industrial exurbs.The strategy was piloted in part by 27-year-old Alex Bruesewitz, who convinced Trump he could reach millions of unlikely voters on these shows. Trump ran some of the campaign\u2019s digital ideas by his son Barron, on whom he has increasingly relied for advice on connecting with younger voters, a source told CNN.Trump started a TikTok account, despite once having threatened to shut down the Chinese social media company, and attempted to build on his outreach through viral moments, including a photo op working at McDonald\u2019s and driving a sanitation truck on an airport tarmac in response to Biden seeming to call his supporters \u201cgarbage.\u201dThe campaign\u2019s intense focus on low-propensity voters, a term political operatives use for people who rarely, if ever, vote, rattled the nerves of longtime Republican operatives used to fighting for more reliable voters whose politics wavered from left to right every election cycle. Trump further alarmed the GOP faithful when his campaign helped orchestrate the ouster of Republican Party chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, threw out the party\u2019s battleground state plans and installed loyalists atop the RNC to help execute his campaign\u2019s vision.The decision to take over the party came with Trump on the heels of securing the nomination after his allies raised concerns about how McDaniel was spending its money.\u201cIt was a marketing operation for the party,\u201d a person involved in reviewing the party\u2019s activity and spending told CNN. \u201cWe needed to get the entire apparatus under one roof.\u201dTaking a riskWiles and Trump\u2019s political director, James Blair, had honed this targeted approach in campaigns they ran together in Florida, including the former president\u2019s successful 2020 operation there. Still, one person deeply involved in carrying out these plans acknowledged to CNN that if Trump lost, they would field considerable blame for their unconventional ways.\u201cWe\u2019re either going to be ridden out of town on a rail for this and a lot of other things,\u201d the person said. \u201cOr we\u2019ll be geniuses, and it will change things for a long period of time.\u201dTheir push relied in part on the work of outside groups, made possible by an FEC decision this year granting campaigns the ability to coordinate with outside political action committees on paid canvassing. Those groups included Turning Point Action, a group targeting younger voters run by Trump loyalist Charlie Kirk, and America PAC, a super PAC founded by tech billionaire Elon Musk, who in the final months steered his tremendous wealth and influence and his social media website X toward getting Trump reelected.By the end of October, Musk\u2019s super PAC had spent more than $140 million on boosting Trump, according to its disclosures with federal regulators, including more than $80 million the group categorized as spending on canvassing and field operations. The money went toward door-knockers, phone bankers and other canvassers, and included daily $1 million giveaways to registered voters in battleground states that prompted the Philadelphia district attorney to sue Musk.In Arizona, Turning Point spent tens of millions on a get-out-the-vote program it called \u201cChase the Vote.\u201d Full-time staff called \u201cballot chasers\u201d were trained to build relationships with 400 to 600 specific individuals over months and ensure they voted in the presidential election. They were instructed to drive them to the polls, help them mail in a ballot and encourage early voting.A week before the election, a person with knowledge of Turning Point\u2019s operation told CNN that it had banked votes from more than 125,000 of the low-propensity voters it had targeted in Arizona \u2014 a margin greater than Trump\u2019s defeat in the state four years prior.Video Ad FeedbackTrump's win made Elon Musk $15 billion richer01:10- Source:CNNA final vibe shiftIn the final stretch of the campaign, Trump\u2019s team grappled with uncertainty, unsure whether their months of groundwork would translate into the outcome they sought.Mounting concerns lingered over Trump\u2019s erratic behavior in the closing weeks \u2014 a pattern marked by chronic tardiness, a subdued energy, and lengthy, meandering speeches before thinning crowds. A particularly chaotic rally at Madison Square Garden, marred by incendiary remarks, risked reminding voters of the very conduct his advisers had carefully sought to keep out of the spotlight. A particularly offensive joke about Puerto Rico by a comedian sent Trump\u2019s political operation into a tizzy of finger-pointing because everyone knew how hard they had worked to build support in Latino communities.With the clock ticking down on Election Day, Trump and his allies appeared to develop last-minute jitters about their reliance on male voters. Kirk, Musk and others spent the day pleading online for men to match the turnout they had seen already. Trump himself sent out a robocall telling men to \u201cget off that beautiful couch\u201d and vote.In the end, though, the concerns were unwarranted. Trump\u2019s campaign had made substantial gains among every demographic his campaign set out to find new votes.\u201cThey came from all quarters: Union, nonunion, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, Arab American, Muslim American,\u201d Trump said in his victory remarks. \u201cWe had everybody, and it was beautiful.

Vice President Kamala Harris, on the other hand, underperformed by about 6.8 million votes compared with Joe Biden in 2020, according to CNN election results as of November 25.Here are seven charts and maps that explain how the US popular vote, turnout in individual states and ultimately turnout in the seven key battleground states \u201a\u00c4\u00ec where electoral votes were up for grabs \u201a\u00c4\u00ec tell the story of Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 loss.This year will end up being one of just two elections in the 21st century in which the Republican presidential candidate got more votes than the Democratic candidate. It is also one of only two times in the 21st century that the number of votes cast dropped compared with the previous presidential election. The other came in 2012, when about 2.2 million fewer votes were cast than in 2008.Another way to look at Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s narrow edge in the popular vote is that he got the vote of about a third of the citizen voting-age population. A slightly smaller portion backed Harris. Another third did not vote at all.While Democrats\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 portion of the vote has been up and down in recent elections, Trump has won more votesin each of the elections in which he was a candidate. Viewed in raw numbers, he got about 63 million votes in 2016, 74 million in 2020 and nearly77 million in 2024.The difference for Democrats was that turnout surged in 2020, the pandemic election.Harris got fewer votes than Biden in 45 of the 50 states and Washington, DC. While votes are still being added to the totals in some states, changes at this point would be marginal.Most of Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 drop-off came in populous states like California, New York and Florida, where a dip in support for Harris did not affect the Electoral College vote tally. Trump boosted his overall count in those population centers as well, padding his count by hundreds of thousands of votes in Texas, Florida and New York and to a lesser extent in traditional Democratic strongholds like New Jersey and Massachusetts.Zooming in on the hotly contested battleground states where the election was much closer, Harris and Trump both gained votes compared with 2020 in Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada. The population has also grown in all of those states in the past four years.Arizona\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s population has also grown, though the total number of votes cast in the state held about even. Harris got fewer votes there compared with Biden in 2020, and Trump carried it with his largest margin of victory across the seven battlegrounds.Pennsylvania and Michigan are battleground states where the population has not grown in the past four years and where Harris got fewer votes in 2024 than Biden got in 2020.Democrats lamenting the results have pointed out that the election was decided by about 230,000 votesin Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, battleground states won narrowly by Trump. But Harris lost votes compared with Biden across the country.Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 losses compared with Biden were biggest in Southern California, southern Florida and in the Northeast. The few places where Harris got more votes than Biden were largelyconcentrated in those seven battleground states, in particular Georgia and North Carolina, but it wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t enough to overcome Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gains. The only state where Harris gained votes on Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2020 performance, that was not also a battleground state, was Utah.Trump made gainsacross the seven battleground states in particular, but they weren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t limited to places with higher turnout. Trump also saw increases in support in a range of counties where fewer votes were cast overall.In Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, even in many counties where more people voted in 2024, Harris got fewer votes than Biden in 2020, although there were pockets in the swing states where Harris got more votes than Biden.Perhaps it shouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be surprising that in the states where the campaign was the most hotly contested, more people voted in 2024, whereas in states where one side or the other seemed more likely to win, turnout generallydropped."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump\u2019s 2024 victory revealed voter shifts that could reshape America\u2019s political landscape", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/10/politics/trump-voter-shifts-nationwide/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014President-electDonald Trumpwon across the map \u2014 improving on Republican margins nearly everywhere and delivering on his promises to win over more non-White voters on his way to defeating Vice President Kamala Harris.Now that the dust has settled on the 2024 presidential election, a dive intoCNN\u2019s exit pollsandcounty-by-county resultscompared with previous races offers an even more detailed glimpse at how Trump won.And perhaps more important for Democrats, the results paint a daunting picture of a party whose national coalition has fractured \u2014 with suburbs where they\u2019ve won squeezed as tight as they can be, Latinos rapidly realigning with the GOP, and Trump posting the sorts of marginal gains among both urban and rural voters that are difficult to overcome.Here are five takeaways on the voters Trump won and what it means moving forward:The Latino realignmentA trend with the potential to remake the American political landscape is the huge shift in Latino voters toward Trump. His gains were visible nationwide, but were particularly glaring in Florida.Trump cruised to a nearly 12-point win in Miami-Dade County, home to a massive population of Cuban Americans and a large and growing number of Venezuelan immigrants. He was the first Republican presidential nominee to win the county in 36 years.CNN 5 ThingsOne Thing: He Never Voted Republican. Trump 2024 Changed That.President-elect Donald Trump is claiming a mandate after making inroads with multiple demographics en route to a popular vote victory. In this episode, we hear from a formerly reliable Democratic voter about why he voted for Trump this time around.\u00a0\nGuest: Nevin SkalkoNov 10, 2024 \u2022 22 min...Apple PodcastsSpotifyTuneIniHeart RadioRadio.comPandoraAmazonRSSPerhaps more ominous for Democrats outside of the Sunshine State, though, was Trump\u2019s strong performance in the Orlando area, where the Latino population is largely Puerto Rican \u2014 and therefore the results more reflective of what\u2019s happening outside Florida as well. Harris\u2019 campaign had hoped the pro-Trump comedian referring to the island as \u201cgarbage\u201d at a Madison Square Garden rally would pay off with those voters. But the results showed they had moved hard in Trump\u2019s favor.Trump\u2019s 1.5-point win in Osceola County flipped a location that President Joe Biden won by 14 points four years earlier. Trump\u2019s performance similarly improved in Orange County, home of Orlando, where Biden won by 23 points in 2020 but Harris won by just 5.6 points this year.CNN\u2019s exit poll showed the dramatic swing in Latino voters over just a four-year period.In 2020, Biden won Latino voters nationally, 65% to Trump\u2019s 32%. For Harris, the advantage was just 52% to Trump\u2019s 46% \u2014 a huge slippage among a demographic that makes up 12% of the overall electorate.With Latino men, the numbers were even more stark. Trump won Latino men by 12 points \u2014 a 35-point swing from 2020. If the dramatic shift continues in future elections, it could remake the American political map, with consequences ranging from presidential races to state legislative battles and more.People listen as Trump participates in a roundtable discussion at the Latino Summit held at Trump National Doral Golf Club on October 22, 2024, in Doral, Florida.Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesGOP\u2019s big border gainsLatino voters\u2019 shift was also on display on the border \u2014 particularly in the Rio Grande Valley in southeast Texas.Starr County, which is 97% Hispanic, hadn\u2019t backed a Republican presidential nominee since 1892 \u2014 and it hadn\u2019t really been close: Hillary Clinton won there by 60 points in 2016. But Trump broke that streak this year, winning Starr County by 16 points. It was a vivid example of the valley\u2019s rapid political evolution.The tough-on-border-security message Trump hammered nationally hit home in the Texas borderland, where residents \u2014 many of whom have been in the United States for generations \u2014 feel the effects of border crossings acutely. Republicans\u2019 cultural appeals and organizing efforts have also paid dividends.There is reason for Democrats to believe they can stop, or at least slow, this shift. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz made gains but did not rack up the same huge border wins that Trump did. A Democratic incumbent, Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, narrowly held on to his Rio Grande Valley seat \u2014 though it was a much closer race than he\u2019d faced against the same opponent in 2022. So did Rep. Henry Cuellar, the most conservative Democrat in the House.The good news for Republicans: It wasn\u2019t just Texas. In the swing state of Arizona, Yuma County \u2014 a border county in the state\u2019s southwestern corner \u2014 went to Trump by 6 points in 2020. He won the county by 29 points this year.Migrants pass through razor wire after crossing the Rio Grande into El Paso, Texas, on February 1, 2024.John Moore/Getty ImagesTrump\u2019s urban improvementTrump criticized Detroit while he was in Detroit. He accused Harris of ruining San Francisco, where she\u2019d been district attorney. He held a rally in deep-blue New York City, despite the state not being in play.While the effectiveness of his campaign tactics is debatable, what\u2019s undeniable is that the former president tapped into a simmering discontent in urban areas, where local governments are led almost exclusively by Democrats.Trump\u2019s percentage of the vote in Wayne County, home of Detroit, ticked upward by 3.4 percentage points compared with 2020. Harris\u2019 percentage dropped by 5.7 points. And the Democratic ticket won the state\u2019s most populous county \u2014 one where racking up huge margins is critical to the party\u2019s hopes statewide \u2014 by 85,000 fewer votes than it had in 2020. Trump\u2019s gains are explained in part by his appeals to Black men, and his efforts to reach out to Arab American voters.The urban swings toward Trump were evident across the political map. He gained significant ground in New York City and the surrounding counties. But even small gains, like the 2 to 3 points he appears to have improved in Philadelphia compared to 2020, is significant: It chopped the Democratic raw vote edge there down by about 55,000 votes.Trump\u2019s improvement was fueled in part by Black men. CNN\u2019s exit polls showed just a 2-point shift among Black men toward Trump nationally. But the shift was much bigger in some key states, like Pennsylvania, where Biden\u2019s 89% to 10% edge turned into a 72% to 26% win for Harris, and North Carolina, where Biden\u2019s 91% to 8% advantage was just 78% to 21% for Harris.People vote in the presidential election on November 5, 2024, in Detroit.Rebecca Cook/ReutersHarris\u2019 suburban flatlineHeaded into Election Day, two potentially outcome-deciding questions loomed: Would Trump\u2019s yearslong efforts to appeal to men, particularly young and non-White men, show up at the polls? And would Harris be able to outpace him by further building on recent Democratic wins in the suburbs?The answers: Yes. And no.The only group with whom Harris improved on Biden\u2019s margins was college-educated women. Her campaign had hoped for big gains with those voters \u2014 people who helped drive Democratic midterm wins in 2018 and 2022, and who might have backed former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. It\u2019s why she campaigned alongside former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who lost her House seat in a 2022 primary after vehemently opposing Trump, in the race\u2019s closing days. But they were nowhere near enough to stop her overall slide.One window into Harris\u2019 failure is the counties surrounding Detroit. Oakland County, sprawling suburban territory that both campaigns had visited in the race\u2019s closing days. Harris won by 10 points and 85,000 votes \u2014 short of the 14-point, 114,000-vote win Biden had notched there in 2020. Macomb County, where Trump had won by 8 points and 40,000 votes four years ago, went to the former president by 14 points and 70,000 votes.Those marginal gains for Trump add up very quickly in a state where he defeated Harris by 78,000 votes.Trump also showed improvement in the Western battlegrounds, including Nevada \u2014 where different mail-in ballot counting rules means the vote is being tallied more slowly, but early indications are that Trump made significant gains, particularly among newly registered independent voters in and around Las Vegas. Independents made up a bigger share of Nevada\u2019s overall electorate than they did in 2020, and they swung 8 points in Trump\u2019s favor.Where Democratic presidential nominees can\u2019t winThe deep challenge the national Democratic Party faces with rural voters was on vivid display in two states the party hasn\u2019t won on the presidential level in a generation: Missouri and Kentucky.In Missouri, policies broadly backed by Democrats won popular support. Voters this year approved statewide ballot measures guaranteeing abortion rights, raising the minimum wage and mandating paid sick leave.Harris, though? Blown out by 15 points.In Kentucky \u2014 the same state that reelected a Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, last year in a campaign that focused largely on cultural battles like abortion rights and transgender rights \u2014 voters resoundingly rejected a proposed school voucher program.They also rejected Harris, handing Trump a 30-point victory.Virtually across the board, Trump picked up even more votes in the largely White, working-class, rural regions where Republicans have long dominated. Those marginal gains made the challenge for Harris of putting together a winning coalition even more daunting \u2014 and, ultimately, impossible.What Democrats will have to grapple with as the party enters a period of soul-searching is why the national party\u2019s brand is so toxic with voters who have sided with the party on policy, and at times handed the party local victories."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Sen.

The automatic recount had been trigged after unofficial results showed the margin between McCormick and Casey within one-half of 1%.Currently, McCormick leads by about 16,000 votes, or 0.2 percentage points. Counties must certify their final results by Monday.McCormick\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s victory is a major upset for the three-term Democratic incumbent in the key battleground state, which also swung back to Donald Trump on the presidential level this year.The Senate race had tightened in the final months of the campaign, but Casey had an edge in most polling of the race for much of his campaign against McCormick, a former hedge fund executive who lost a bid for the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s other Senate seat in 2022. Republicans and Democrats alike spent big in Pennsylvania as it emerged as a pivotal battleground up and down the ballot.McCormick frequently appeared with Trump at his rallies this year after losing out on the former president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s endorsement during the primary two years ago. And although the GOP Senate nominee often appeared to be running behind Trump in his contest with Vice President Kamala Harris in public polling of the race, he and his GOP allies leaned into the issue of immigration, which was at the center of the Republican Party\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2024 election strategy.Republicans hammered Casey on the issue, dedicating millions of dollars in attack ads tying the senator to the Biden administration\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s record on the border.McCormick, the former CEO of Bridgewater Associates, made an anti-incumbency argument, calling Casey \u201a\u00c4\u00fatoo weak\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and asking voters in one of his closing messages to \u201a\u00c4\u00famake a change,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 while recapping his bio as a West Point graduate.McCormick, whose wife Dina Powell worked as a national security adviser to Trump, was nearly onstage during a July assassination attempt against the former president in Butler, Pennsylvania. But Trump told him to stay seated for another few minutes, shortly before the gunman struck.McCormick\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s victory means Pennsylvania will, for at least the next four years, be one of the few states with senators from different parties.

CNN has not yet projected the race for control of the US House of Representatives.With Donald Trump winning Arizona, Gallego also becomes one of several Democrats who were able to win Senate seats this year while the president-elect was carrying their states.The Senate election in Arizona pitted Gallego, a fifth-term congressman who rebranded himself as a moderate in the general election, against Lake, the 2022 GOP nominee for governor and a close Trump ally who pushed false conspiracies about the 2020 election and her own loss two years later.Gallego on Monday thanked Republicans who voted for him, saying, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThey took a chance on me.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to agree all the time, and I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m going to always seek the input, and we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to find middle ground where we can,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said at a news conference shortly after the race was called. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut at the core, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m always going to defend the Constitution of the United States and the interests of everyday Arizonans.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Asked what he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d fight against with a Republican White House and Senate majority, Gallego said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time to fight we will fight the administration.

Rick Scott will win a second term in Florida, CNN projects, defeating Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in a race that demonstrated the strength of the GOP in a state once considered one of the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s premier political battlegrounds.With a return to the Senate next year assured, Scott is positioned to wage his uphill bid to succeed Mitch McConnell as Senate Republican leader in the new Congress. The secret-ballot vote is set to take place sometime after the election.Scott unsuccessfully challenged McConnell for his leadership position in 2022, as the Florida senator was coming off an underwhelming turn in charge of his party\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Senate campaign operation that cycle. But Scott\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s odds of succeeding McConnell this time could benefit from his close relationship with his state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most famous resident: former President Donald Trump.Scott\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s victory over Mucarsel-Powell caps what ultimately was the least competitive race of a political career defined in part by exceptionally hard-fought contests. Scott narrowly won two terms as governor by about 1 percentage point in 2010 and 2014 and then unseated Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in 2018 by 10,0000 votes out of 8.2 million ballots cast \u201a\u00c4\u00ee one of the closest statewide elections in Florida history.To win those races, Scott, a former health care executive and one of the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wealthiest elected officials, dipped deeply into his personal fortune, including a $63 million investment in his first Senate campaign. This time, though, he spent far less of his own money as Mucarsel-Powell, a former South Florida congresswoman, struggled to fundraise.Democrats made a late play for the seat as other paths to maintaining their Senate majority grew increasingly tenuous. In September, they announced a multimillion-dollar advertising push in Florida, a token investment in a historically expensive state to compete.There was hope, though, that Mucarsel-Powell could build on the enthusiasm surrounding Vice President Kamala Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 entrance into the race. Democrats remained optimistic, too, that ballot measures to legalize recreational marijuana and expand abortion access in the state could give their Senate nominee a boost. Mucarsel-Powell campaigned aggressively on abortion in a state where it is now illegal for women to undergo the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy, unless their life is at risk or they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re the victim of rape or incest.However, Scott benefited greatly from a favorable shift in the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s political makeup since he first entered the Senate.
