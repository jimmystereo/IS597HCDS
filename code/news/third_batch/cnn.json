And I hope that that means they can get access to the care they need,\u201d L. Williams, one of the minors challenging the law, told CNN, referring to other trans kids facing health care bans like Tennessee\u2019s.CNNRelated article26 states have passed laws restricting gender-affirming care for trans youthThe conservative-majority court will examine the law at a critical time for transgender Americans. Since 2020, Republican-led states around the country have passed a wave of laws regulating the lives of trans Americans, with a particular focus on minors. And though the community makes up a small fraction of the American public, it featured prominently duringthe 2024 election and its aftermath,with President-elect Donald Trump amplifying his pledge to further curtail civil rights for trans people during the closing days of the campaign.Depending on how the court rules, similar prohibitions on gender-affirming care \u2013 and, potentially, other laws targeting transgender people \u2013 would be at risk of falling altogether or receiving a powerful endorsement from the high court.Here\u2019s what to know about the case:Justices may decide how much protection transgender people haveThe case, known asUS v. Skrmetti,represents only the second time in recent years that the court has been tasked withdeciding the extent to which federal law protects transgenderpeople from discrimination.The last time the court tackled that question was in a case from 2020 calledBostock v. Clayton County. In that matter, the majority, led by conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, ruled that federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in the workplace applies to gay and transgender workers since such action \u201cnecessarily\u201d happens because of that person\u2019s sex.The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in US v. Skrmetti on December 4, 2024 in Washington, DC.Kevin Mohatt/Reuters/FileRelated articleHow a Supreme Court decision on health care bans for transgender youth could impact trans people nationwideSince then, lower courts around the country have grappled with how to apply the legal rationale that emerged inBostockin other cases dealing with transgender issues.This case will have an even greater impact on other laws concerning transgender people, legal experts say. That\u2019s partly because the court may decide whether trans Americans as a group are entitled to receive protection from discrimination.\u201cThis is going to be their first opportunity to address the rights of the transgender community under the equal protection clause, especially in view of the vast proliferation of state legislation targeting transgender individuals, and, in particular, transgender youth,\u201d said Katie Eyer, a professor at Rutgers Law School who joined a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the law\u2019s challengers.\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important case,\u201d she added. \u201cIt will set the tone for and set the law for what type of scrutiny these laws will be subjected to across the board.\u201dWhat the Tennessee law doesThe Tennessee law at the center of Wednesday\u2019s arguments wassigned by Republican Gov. Bill Lee in 2023.Known as SB 1, the measure bans hormone therapy and puberty blockers for minors in the state and imposes civil penalties for doctors who violate the prohibitions. It also bans gender-affirming surgeries, though that provision is not at issue in the case.CNN One ThingMeet the Trans Lawyer Making History at the Supreme CourtThe Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments today in a case that could reshape the landscape of transgender medical care for young Americans. One of the lawyers arguing for the plaintiffs will make history just by being there.\u00a0\nGuest: Chelsea Bailey, CNN Senior WriterDec 04, 2024 \u2022 21 min...Apple PodcastsSpotifyTuneIniHeart RadioPandoraAmazonRSSRadio.comSpecifically, the law prohibits providers in the state from administering such care if the purpose is to enable \u201ca minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex,\u201d or treat \u201cpurported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity.\u201dThe Republican lawmakers who crafted the law wrote in their legislative findings that \u201cminors lack the maturity to fully understand and appreciate the life-altering consequences of such procedures\u201d and that the state \u201chas a legitimate, substantial, and compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty.\u201dCrucially, the law makes an exception for doctors to provide the same otherwise prohibited care to cisgender minors seeking treatment for a congenital defect or early puberty, among other things.CNNRelated article26 states have passed laws restricting gender-affirming care for trans youthA slew of other GOP-led states havepassed similar health care bans in recent years.Today, more than 110,000 teenagers live in states where restrictions on puberty blockers and hormone therapy exist, according to theWilliams Institute at UCLA School of Law.\u2018Life-changing\u2019 careL. Williams told CNN this week that receiving gender-affirming care has been \u201clife-changing,\u201d giving her more confidence as she navigates adolescence.\u201cIt\u2019s been very helpful, very helpful \u2013 life-changing,\u201d she said. \u201cFor some people, it\u2019s even been life-saving.\u201dThe state\u2019s ban has forced her to travel out of state to continue receiving care for her gender dysphoria, the medical term for an uncomfortable conflict between a person\u2019s assigned gender and the gender with which the person identifies. The travel is a stressful reality that has caused the high school junior to frequently miss school.\u201cIt\u2019s also very terrifying because I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do without the care because it certainly left me in a much better place mentally than I was a few years ago,\u201d she said of the state\u2019s decision to restrict the care. \u201cI was just terrified of what would happen.\u201dWilliams will be in the courtroom on Wednesday to witness the historic arguments unfold \u2013 a unique position that seemed unlikely for the 16-year-old.\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine that I would be headed to the Supreme Court,\u201d she said.How the case got to SCOTUSSB 1 was initially challenged by three trans minors in Tennessee, their parents and a doctor in the state whose practice included intreating minors for gender dysphoria.The Biden administration later joined that lawsuit and a federal judge in Tennessee sided with the challengers in June 2023.Judge Eli Richardson, a Trump appointee, said in a ruling temporarily blocking the law that the measure violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. The judge reviewed the law under a standard of review known as heightened scrutiny and decided that since it \u201clikely is not substantially related to the state\u2019s asserted interest\u201d it is unconstitutional.Notably, Richardson ruled that SB1 \u201cdiscriminates based on transgender status and that transgender individuals constitute a quasi-suspect class\u201d that qualify for additional protections under the law.The state appealed to the Cincinnati-based 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which decided that the law should be subject to the lowest standard of review, called rational basis. A divided three-judge panel said that transgender people are not part of a \u201cquasi-suspect class\u201d and that the legal reasoning inBostockdoes not apply outside the context of workplace discrimination.The appeals court ruling was authored by Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton, a George W. Bush appointee, and joined by Judge Amul Thapar, a Trump appointee. Judge Helene White, a Bush appointee, dissented.The challengers filed separate appeals to the Supreme Court, which decided in June to review only the administration\u2019s case.What each side will argueThe case will turn on what level of scrutiny the justices decide is appropriate for examining SB 1. But that ruling, expected before July, will extend far beyond Tennessee\u2019s borders: It will help guide judges on lower courts who are handling disputes related to anti-trans laws on bathroom access, school sports and pronouns, among other things.The US Supreme Court is seen on the first day of a new term in Washington, DC, on October 7, 2024.Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleIn transgender care case, Supreme Court to consider how far equal protection goesLawyers for the Biden administration have asked the justices to consider whether the law passes constitutional muster under heightened scrutiny, which requires states to show they have an important government interest in banning treatment and that the law achieves that goal in a way that\u2019s \u201csubstantially related\u201d to its interest.Should the Supreme Court examine the law under that standard, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogarwrote in court papers,\u201cit should hold that SB1 cannot survive heightened scrutiny\u201d based on a long line of cases in which the court \u201chas consistently held that all sex-based classifications are subject to heightened scrutiny because such classifications too often reflect stereotypes about how men and women should look or act.\u201dThe administration told the court that \u201ctransgender individuals satisfy all of the hallmarks of a quasi-suspect class,\u201d a position that, if adopted by the high court, would also give the advocates for the community a powerful tool when challenging laws like SB 1 in court.Prelogar also told the justices that they could, alternatively, send the case back to the appeals court to consider whether SB 1 is constitutional under the higher standard of review it prefers.For its part, Tennessee has told the court that the law \u201cincludes no sex classification\u201d and that it instead draws an age- and use-based distinction that is permissible under the equal protection clause. In other words, the state says, the law bars the treatment for both boys and girls who want to transition.Attorneys for the state urged the justices to not \u201cget back in the fraught business of creating suspect classes\u201d and warned that doing so in this case would, in their view, wrongly give transgender women the same legal protections as cisgender women.\u201cIf the government\u2019s theory holds, men who identify as women could claim constitutionally based access to women\u2019s bathrooms, women\u2019s locker rooms, and women\u2019s sports,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAccepting that theory would perversely erode women\u2019s rights and jeopardize landmark statutes protecting women\u2019s equal access to schools, winners\u2019 podiums, and beyond.\u201dRoberts, Gorsuch among the justices to watchThe Supreme Courtlast touched on transgender rights in a substantive way four years agoin a surprising decision that held federal law bars discrimination against gay and transgender employees in the workplace.The reason: Such discrimination is necessarily based on sex.Part of the reason why theBostockdecisionwasunexpected was because of the author: Gorsuch. The Trump nominee was joined in the majority by Chief Justice John Roberts as well as the court\u2019s liberal wing. The court\u2019s other conservatives at the time \u2013 Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 dissented.\u201cIt is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex,\u201d the 6-3 majority said.Because the Biden administration is relying in part on Bostock, both Roberts and Gorsuch will be key votes to watch during the arguments.The Bostock majority stressed that the decision dealt only with the workplace. But trans rights advocates say it\u2019s difficult to see how the logic the court used in Bostock \u2013 that discrimination against transgender workers is necessarily discrimination based on sex \u2013 wouldn\u2019t apply in other contexts.Another justice to watch is Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 a Trump nominee who sometimes breaks with conservative ideology.Barrett wasn\u2019t sitting on the court when Bostock was decided. She was picked to fill the seat of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon whose death a few months afterBostockwas decided helped move the court further to the right.Justices will hear from trans lawyerChase Strangio, one of three attorneys who will be parrying questions from the justices over the course of the arguments, will make history as thefirst known transgender personto argue before the Supreme Court.Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, will be speaking on behalf of the three transgender minors and their families who initially challenged the Tennessee law.\u201cIt is not lost on me that I will be standing there at the lectern at the Supreme Court in part because I was able to have access to the medical care that is the very subject of the case that we\u2019re litigating,\u201d Strangio told CNN.Prelogar will argue first, representing the Biden administration. Widely respected for her advocacy among both conservatives and liberals, it is possible the trans case will be Prelogar\u2019s last major argument before the high court.Tennessee will be represented by J. Matthew Rice, a former clerk to Justice Thomas \u2013 and one-time professional baseball player \u2013 who is making his debut before the justices.A fight over medicineIntertwined with the legal arguments over the law is a fight over the thorny issue of modern medicine and which health experts the court should listen more closely to.Major medical associations \u2013 including theAmerican Medical Association, theAmerican Psychiatric Associationand theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\u2013 agree gender-affirming care isclinically appropriatefor children and adults, and research showsthe risk of suicideis high among youth who experience gender dysphoria.The Biden administration and a host of outside groups have leaned into those points as they\u2019ve asked the court to consider the impact of a ruling in favor of Tennessee.\u201cDenying access to medical care and treating transgender youth disparately because of their transgender status are correlated with substantially increased risks of suicide and negative mental health outcomes,\u201d the Trevor Project, a nonprofit that works to prevent suicide among LGBTQ youth, told the justices in one friend-of-the-court brief.On the other hand, Tennessee\u2019s attorneys describe the banned treatments as \u201crisky, unproven gender-transition interventions\u201d that they say can cause irreversible changes to minors.\u201cWhile the government is free to favor its transition-first, ask-questions-later approach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to that same choice,\u201d they wrote.Among the groups backing Tennessee\u2019s approach is Do No Harm, Inc., a conservative medical advocacy group whose chairman told CNN that while the organization doesn\u2019t oppose gender-affirming care for adults, it believes such care should not be administered to minors.\u201cAdults can do as they as they will, and there are perfectly fine people that have transitioned. That\u2019s their business,\u201d said Dr. Stanley Goldfarb. \u201cBut we feel that children just are really unable to do this in a way that involves informed consent, primarily, and that many of them are just children that are very troubled.\u201dTrump looms large over historic caseTrump ran for reelection in part on a message of ending \u201ctransgender craziness\u201d and he specifically attacked Vice President Kamala Harris for supporting \u201cthey/them,\u201d a reference to pronouns sometimes used by transgender and non-binary individuals. The Skrmetti appeal is likely to still be pending at the Supreme Court when Trump moves into the White House on January 21.If the incoming Department of Justice announces it is changing positions, that could give the Supreme Court an out \u2013 an opportunity to dismiss the appeal. On the other hand, with the case fully briefed and argued there\u2019s a good chance the court would simply proceed as planned.\u201cIt\u2019s not all that unusual,\u201d said Pratik Shah, a veteran Supreme Court attorney who is working with the ACLU on behalf of the trans clients. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t change anything in terms of the court\u2019s ability and process for deciding the case.\u201dCNN\u2019s Casey Gannon and Chelsea Bailey contributed to this report."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Democrats\u2019 flip in California concludes final unresolved US House race", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/04/politics/democrats-flip-california-house-race/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Republican Rep.

Lindsey Graham, are now wondering whether Hegseth can survive the tightrope walk to confirmation, sending an ominous signal for the incoming White House.Hegseth will need to limit defections to three GOP senators, assuming all Democrats vote against him, and there are already more than three senators who are uncertain if they\u2019ll back him.\u201cHe obviously has a chance to defend himself here. But some of this stuff is \u2013 it\u2019s going to be difficult,\u201d Graham, a longtime military veteran and South Carolina Republican, said on Tuesday. Hegseth, who has denied any wrongdoing, is under intense scrutiny amid a series of misconduct allegations, includinga sexual assault allegationfrom 2017, which he has denied and in which no charges were filed.\u201cHe has not been forthright with the Transition team staff and the president-elect and vice president-elect,\u201d a senior Trump transition source told CNN, noting that as of Tuesday evening, Hegseth\u2019s nomination is in trouble. The source pointed to Wednesday \u2013 when Hegseth is expected to be interviewed on Fox, after his mother appeared on the network in the morning \u2013 as \u201cabsolutely critical.\u201dAlso on Wednesday, Hegseth is set to meet with Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican and military veteran whose opinion of him is expected to be influential.Some Hill Republicans have said they are privately watching for potential alternatives, including Ernst, according to a person familiar with the conversations.Trump\u2019s allies involved in the transition process have been compiling a list of alternative candidates in recent days in the event Hegseth\u2019s road to confirmation appears destined to implode, multiple sources familiar with the discussions told CNN. Ernst and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are among the names under consideration.DeSantis, who served in the Navy as a JAG officer, is interested in serving as defense secretary if he is formally offered the job, two sources close to the Florida governor told CNN. His name was on the initial list of candidates for secretary of defense that Trump was shown, according to a person familiar, and the president-elect and DeSantis have discussed the Florida governor potentially leading the Pentagon. CNN has reached out to a representative for DeSantis for comment.Even as many GOP senators insisted to reporters this week that they haven\u2019t asked Hegseth about the allegations in private conversations with him, other GOP senators and senior aides are growing frustrated by the drip-drip of negative coverage about him.The incoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Roger Wicker, told CNN that he expects to see a whistleblower report outlining allegations of misconduct during Hegseth\u2019s time running a veterans\u2019 group. The New Yorker this weekdetailed the allegations in the report.\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see it,\u201d the Mississippi Republican told CNN. The New Yorker did not name the employees who compiled the whistleblower report and CNN has not independently reviewed the report. Other reports have also emerged about Hegseth\u2019s conduct while employed at Fox News.\u201cThere are significant concerns more accusations are going to come out from his time at Fox News,\u201d the transition source told CNN.Hegseth and his attorney remained defiant Wednesday morning.\u201cI\u2019m doing this for the warfighters, not the warmongers,\u201d Hegseth posted on X. \u201cThe Left is afraid of disrupters and change agents. They are afraid of@realDonaldTrump\u2014and me. So they smear w/ fake, anonymous sources & BS stories. They don\u2019t want truth. Our warriors never back down, & neither will I.\u201dTimothy Parlatore, an attorney for Hegseth, said they are \u201cgoing to address these concerns head on\u201d and said the nominee \u201cis not in any way considering withdrawing.\u201d\u201cAll of the claims that would form the basis of replacing him are false and are things that could be easily countered by the facts,\u201d Parlatore added.Alternate names emergePeople involved in Trump transition planning for the Pentagon started floating other options after the first allegations about Hegseth surfaced, driven in large part by concerns that he could face a similar \u201cmath problem\u201d as Matt Gaetz, who withdrew from consideration as Trump\u2019s attorney general pick last month.Trump\u2019s transition team was blindsided by the 2017 sexual assault allegation against Hegseth \u2013 and then again after the related police report surfaced. As an avalanche of media reports on Hegseth\u2019s alleged past transgressions have emerged, the patience of many in Trump\u2019s orbit has grown thin.And while Trump\u2019s team has carefully choreographed Hegseth\u2019s first few days on the Hill in an attempt to create a sense of positive momentum \u2013 what one Senate GOP aide described as \u201coperation warp speed coalition-building\u201d \u2013 expressions of doubt from Republican senators have continued to surface.Hegseth, a former conservative commentator, has devoted recent days to meeting many of Trump\u2019s closest allies, including some who appeared on Hegseth\u2019s own program during his time at Fox News.Some Trump advisers believe picking a senator to fill the slot would reduce the controversial nomination fights ahead and allow the president-elect\u2019s team to focus their efforts on the confirmation process for key law enforcement and intelligence roles.Ernst is widely viewed as willing to accept the role and, most importantly, confirmable, the sources said. She recently spent several days at Mar-a-Lago, where she discussed Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees as well as plans related to DOGE, according to her social media posts.Other Trump allies are floating Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty for the role, according to a fourth source familiar with the matter.CNN has reached out to representatives for Ernst and Hagerty.One source close to both Trump and Hegseth, however, pushed back on the notion that anyone else was being seriously considered for the role, or that there was any sort of official list being made of replacement candidates.Deepening questionsKey Senate Republicans have recently said they believe Hegseth must undergo an FBI background check and a confirmation hearing before they are ready to vote yes \u2013 comments that coincided with the transition announcing on Tuesday that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Justice Department that would unlock the government vetting process.Still, it is unclear how many of Trump\u2019s candidates to lead various agencies and departments will be submitted to the FBI for background checks.With the Senate\u2019s narrow margins next year, the focus will be on more moderate and establishment GOP voices like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, as well as incoming Sen. John Curtis of Utah.\u201cAs I\u2019ve repeatedly said to you, I believe that we need an FBI background check to evaluate the allegations,\u201d Collins told CNN on Tuesday, adding that Hegseth should complete the usual questionnaire about his background and participate in a public hearing. Collins has not yet met with Hegseth.The fact that allegations against Hegseth revolve around sexual assault and women serving in military combat roles \u2013 two issues Republicans have led the way in reforming \u2013 have only added to the anxieties that his nomination may be doomed.Commenting on the Hegseth selection, Graham said, \u201cLeadership comes from the top. And I want to make sure that every young woman who joins the military feels welcomed and respected.\u201dRepublicans are closely watching Ernst, who \u2013 as the first female combat veteran elected to the Senate \u2013 has raised concerns about Hegseth\u2019s prior comments that women should not serve in combat roles.Ernst has previously said that she wants to have \u201ca hard discussion\u201d with him about the role of women in combat roles.Hegseth told reporters on Tuesday whether he believed women should be in combat. His response: \u201cI think they\u2019re already in combat.\u201dBut the senior transition source underscored how critical Hegseth\u2019s meeting will be with Ernst,who\u2019s spoken outabout surviving mental and physical abuse by her former husband and being raped by a boyfriend in college and has worked to combat military sexual assault.\u201cIf she isn\u2019t comfortable with Pete and he doesn\u2019t answer her questions about women in the military and about sexual assault \u2013 and she\u2019s a survivor \u2013 if she doesn\u2019t leave the meeting supporting him, there are about 5 or 6 Republican senators who will oppose his nomination,\u201d the source said.And it\u2019s not just Graham in the Senate acknowledging the growing pileup of allegations against Hegseth.Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, another key Trump ally, said, \u201cSome new things that have come to light in the last 12 to 14 hours are things he needs to address.\u201d Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said \u201cof course\u201d the allegations are \u201cconcerning.\u201d Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma said he believed it was \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201cfair\u201d to ask about allegations that Hegseth was intoxicated at work events.\u201cThe president \u2026 should have the ability to make decisions on who they want as their advisers. But the Senate has a constitutional role as well,\u201d Lankford said.Sen. Bill Cassidy said the allegations \u201chave to be addressed,\u201d and emphasized the importance of a thorough vetting process for Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks. The Louisiana Republican added, \u201cmany people go through a rough period in their life.\u201dMany in the Senate GOP said their main line of questioning for Hegseth will be more about his plans to reform the Pentagon, while giving him the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d about allegations against him, as Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota put it.\u201cHe\u2019s denied any wrongdoing. My main interest is, what kind of cultural shift are we going to see in the Pentagon?\u201d Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri said, adding that no charges were ever filed against Hegseth.\u201cPresident Trump \u2026 has got a right to pick who he wants to lead the Department of Defense and I think that Pete Hegseth right now is in a pretty strong position,\u201d he added.This story has been updated with additional reporting.CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, Kaitlan Collins, Kristen Holmes, Sara Murray, Danya Gainor, Morgan Rimmer, Ali Main, Ted Barrett and Haley Talbot contributed."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump\u2019s DOGE push finds support from some Democrats on Capitol Hill", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/04/politics/trump-doge-democrats-capitol-hill/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Elon Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s promise to severely slash government spending has found glimmers of support from some unlikely allies: Democrats.Democratic Rep.

The DOGE caucus is emerging as a viable option for Democrats, presenting an opportunity for lawmakers to participate in a forum without having to take votes on official positions.Democrats are signaling that they want to be part of the conversation on overhauling government while also serving as a check on Republicans if they try to use their power in Congress and the White House to make cuts to programs like Medicare or Social Security.The new subcommittee on the House Oversight panel specifically tasked to work with DOGE and led by Trump ally GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, however, is a different story.\u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to be a part of anything Marjorie might be in charge of,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Moskowitz, who has a history of sparring with Greene, told CNN.As Democrats look to find instances where they can work across the aisle to cut government spending, there is broader skepticism about the overall effort, even from Republican appropriators who support the underlying principles of DOGE, but caution that arbitrary cuts without a full understanding of the functions of governmental programs are not the answer, a source familiar with the conversations told CNN.The Senate has launched a companion DOGE caucus, and House Speaker Mike Johnson is hosting joint meetings with Musk and Ramaswamy on Thursday with lawmakers from both chambers, in an effort to kickstart the work.Trump announced last month that Musk and Ramaswamy would lead the newly formed department.It was not immediately clearwhen Trump made the announcement how the department \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which he said would \u201a\u00c4\u00faprovide advice and guidance from outside of Government\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec would operate.Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, who is leading the Senate DOGE caucus, said Thursday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s meetings will be \u201a\u00c4\u00faa great collaboration I think to find out where we want to go as caucuses and to mesh that or nest that with the goals of the administration.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Sanders said he wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t join the caucus, but he said Musk makes a good point on the Defense Department specifically.\u201a\u00c4\u00faI think there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s massive amounts of waste \u201a\u00c4\u00b6. Let\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s go after that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo I will work with them on the specific areas where we can make some positive change.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9GOP Sen. Cynthia Lummis told CNN, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think that this commission that is chaired by Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk is the most exciting thing that has happened in government in decades.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is going to be, in my opinion, the true masterpiece of Trump 47,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said.Oversight Committee Democrats in search of a new leader \u201a\u00c4\u00ec since Rep.

He was alsoconvicted by a juryin June of illegally buying and possessing a gun as a drug user. The president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pardon explicitly granted clemency for the tax and gun offenses from Hunter Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s existing cases, plus any potential federal crimes he may have committed \u201a\u00c4\u00fafrom January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden walk in downtown Nantucket Massachusetts, on November 29, 2024.Jose Luis Magana/APRelated articleDemocrats left fuming over Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to pardon his son \u201a\u00c4\u00ee after he repeatedly said he wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4tIn thepardon announcementSunday night, Joe Biden claimed his son was one of many Americans \u201a\u00c4\u00fawho were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But, as the judge pointed out, as part of Hunter Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s guilty plea, he admitted to not paying his tax debts even after regaining his sobriety, and even though he had the funds to pay.The judge also rebuked the president for claiming his son was \u201a\u00c4\u00fasingled out\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for prosecution because of political reasons. Earlier this year, Scarsi rejected this exact argument from Hunter Biden, who wanted the indictment tossed on those grounds. (The judge in Hunter Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gun case also rejected the selective-prosecution theory.)Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s announcement claimed \u201a\u00c4\u00fano reasonable person\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 could conclude this wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t a politically motivated prosecution.

It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also an idea that some key members of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s incoming administration and the Republican Senate caucus have vocally supported for years.But some experts say the suggestion of sweeping changes resulting from a possible elimination of clock changes is overblown.\u201a\u00c4\u00faI think this is really an argument between morning people and nighttime people,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Dr. Jadrian Wooten, a collegiate associate professor at Virginia Tech\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Department of Economics who has studied the risk and benefits of Daylight Saving Time.The benefits espoused by people who prefer more light in the morning could inversely be true for the same as those who prefer more light later in the afternoon. For each study that shows a positive one way, another study can show one for the other.There are three different camps in the debate. One argues for leaving the time changes as they currently are, with most of the country changing their clocks forward in March and back in November. This approach attempts to balance the amount of sunlight people receive on any given day and strikes a compromise between those who prefer more sunlight in the morning and those who prefer more in the evening; each group gets their preference at different points in the year. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the Goldilocks solution.The second advocates for a permanent standard time, keeping the clocks as they are from November to March year-round. This would lead to parts of the country experiencing earlier sunrises and sunsets than they usually do during those five months \u201a\u00c4\u00ec leaving more light in the morning and less in the evening. This approach is supported by medical groups and professionals who say it most closely aligns with the body\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s natural circadian rhythm.\u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you get too much light too late in the evening, it disrupts your sleep, and we are essentially creating a months-long environment in which we are actually receiving light at a time that is later in the day than is optimal for our health,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Dr. Adam Spira, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies the benefits of healthy sleep habits.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re already a sleep-deprived society,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Spira said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faand we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re making it harder for people to fall asleep.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9This approach also resonates with parents who don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want their children waiting for the school bus under a dark morning sky.\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s kids getting ready to go to school,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Wooten, the Virginia Tech economist. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s kids getting on the bus. You know, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s really dangerous to put kids out waiting for the bus in the morning when it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s really dark outside, and so if you have that extra time in the morning, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a safer morning for most people, right?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9The third advocates for a permanent Daylight Saving Time. The sun would rise and set later, giving people less daylight in the morning and more in the evening. This approach is often supported by retail, business and restaurant groups and organizations that want people to have enough daylight left after work or school to be out and about and participating in the economy, and by those who say more daylight in the evening could reduce crime.The reasons for supporting any side in this debate are as disparate as each individual\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s own personal life experiences; some parents may prefer that their children not wait for the bus during a dark morning, while other parents may prefer there be some daylight while they watch their kids practice sports after school.While Musk and Ramaswamy both said they support ending the clock changes, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not clear whether they are proposing the country adopt permanent Daylight Saving Time or permanent standard time. Musk seemed to signal support for both conflicting ideas in his posts to X last week.\u201a\u00c4\u00faLooks like the people want to abolish the annoying time changes!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he wrote in response to an X user who made poll that showed wide support for abolishing Daylight Saving Time.Hours later, he responded with an enthusiastic \u201a\u00c4\u00faYes!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 when Florida Sen. Rick Scott touted the Sunshine Protection Act, legislation he supports which would \u201a\u00c4\u00falock the clock\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and make Daylight Saving Time the standard. That post, which said Daylight Saving Time \u201a\u00c4\u00faneeds to go,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 was eventually deleted because it contained what Scott\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office described as a typographical error.Scott, whose unsuccessful bid for Senate leadership was supported by Musk and who now sits on the DOGE Senate caucus, signed a state version of that bill into law when he was governor of Florida in 2018.\u201a\u00c4\u00faFloridians are sick of changing their clocks because we all want more sunshine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Scott said in an October statement touting the bill. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time for Congress to act, pass the Sunshine Protection Act and lock the clock.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Previous attempts to do so have faltered. Daylight Saving Time was first introduced during World War I to assist with the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s industrial productivity during the Great War \u201a\u00c4\u00ec not, as popular rumors frequently suggest, to give farmers more day time during harvest.Daylight Saving Time was kept permanent during most of World War II, also for reasons to do with industry and energy. During the gas crisis in the 1970s, the country once again tried making Daylight Saving Time permanent, only for public approval to plummet after complaints of children being hit by cars while waiting for the bus at night.States aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t required to change their clocks; Hawaii, most of Arizona and some US territories in the Pacific and Caribbean do not observe Daylight Saving Time. In 2022, the US Senate passed legislation making Daylight Saving Time permanent, but the House failed to vote on it. And last year, a bipartisan group of senators reintroduced legislation that would make a switch to daylight saving permanent. Now, with the possible support of one of the richest men in the world, the country may prepare to make another change \u201a\u00c4\u00ec one way or the other.Musk and Ramaswamy are expected to address Republican House and Senate members on Thursday afternoon, with the meeting expected to center on the newly formed efficiency department."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Kash Patel, Trump\u2019s pick to lead FBI, has been targeted in an Iranian hack, sources say", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/politics/kash-patel-targeted-iran-hack/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Kash Patel, President-electDonald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4spick to run the FBI, was recently informed by the bureau that he had been targeted as part of an Iranian hack, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.Hackers are believed to have accessed at least some of Patel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s communications, according to one of the sources.Trump transition spokesman Alex Pfeiffer declined to comment specifically on the hack in a statement to CNN.\u201a\u00c4\u00faKash Patel was a key part of the first Trump administration\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s efforts against the terrorist Iranian regime and will implement President Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s policies to protect America from adversaries as the FBI Director,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Pfeiffer said in the statement.Members of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s inner circle have been targeted by foreign hackers in recent months.

Among them is Florida governor and one-time Trump primary adversary Ron DeSantis, who is interested in the position if he is formally offered the job, two sources close to the governor told CNN\u2019s Steve Contorno.Hegseth\u2019s hopes appear to be ebbing ahead of a Fox News interview scheduled for Wednesday. A senior Trump administration source told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper late Tuesday night, \u201cTomorrow is going to be absolutely critical.\u201d The source suggested that Hegseth hadn\u2019t been forthcoming with the Trump team about his past behavior involving women and alcohol.Timothy Parlatore, an attorney for Hegseth, said, \u201cWe are going to address these concerns head on,\u201d adding, \u201cHe is not in any way considering withdrawing.\u201dTrump\u2019s criteria for picking Cabinet secretaries seems to depend on how willing they\u2019ll be to do exactly what he wants \u2014 in this case, to root out what he regards as \u201cwoke\u201d generals \u2014 and how good they look on TV. But Trump\u2019s subordinates enter a danger zone when they begin to come across as beleaguered and besieged and reflect poorly on him. That\u2019s what happened to short-lived attorney general pick Matt Gaetz last month, and Hegseth risks entering similar territory.His fate will not only depend on whether sufficient Republican senators will defer to the president-elect. Trump must decide how much of his considerable but limited political capital he wants to spend on getting Hegseth confirmed and even whether he\u2019s willing to go ahead with a surely explosive confirmation hearing early next year.As soon as he was picked, Hegseth was forced to explain revelations about an alleged sexual assault of a woman in 2017 that he denies. He\u2019s said the encounter was consensual, and he was not charged. But now he\u2019s facing new revelations after The New Yorker reported he was forced out of veterans\u2019 advocacy groups over allegations of mismanagement and personal misconduct, with the magazine describing a whistleblower report from former employees who claimed he was intoxicated at work events and pursued female staff. The magazine did not name the employees behind the complaints, and CNN has not independently reviewed the report. (A Hegseth adviser said the reports were \u201coutlandish claims\u201d from a disgruntled former associate).Hegseth has expressed views that might have endeared him to Trump but that could be problematic in his hearing. For instance, CNN\u2019s KFile reported Tuesday that when protests broke out in US cities in 2020, he suggested on Fox that troops should be sent into Seattle.Hegseth is one of a corps of Cabinet picks who reflect Trump\u2019s fury against the elite establishment in Washington and expressed desire for retribution. While he lacks top-level strategic, diplomatic and managerial experience, his distinguished war record would help him connect with the rank and file.But there\u2019s only so much any one Cabinet pick can stand before the drip, drip of controversy begins to reflect badly on the president-elect. And Hegseth\u2019s deepening troubles are now beginning to capture headlines that are detracting from Trump\u2019s bid to dominate the political narrative before he takes office.Republicans don\u2019t want a showdown with TrumpRepublican senators are not looking for a fight with Trump, who will take office next month as the most powerful new president in decades.But Hegseth can only lose the votes of three Republicans in the new Senate and still get confirmed. So the majority of GOP senators could back him and stand firm with Trump, and only a few dissenters could scuttle his nomination \u2014 even if they\u2019d surely prefer to not to have to cast a public vote against the president-elect. That dilemma is especially acute since concern among Republican senators helped derail the Gaetz selection last month.A sense that Trump\u2019s most unorthodox picks for senior posts are becoming accident-prone was bolstered on Tuesday when Chad Chronister, a Florida sheriff, withdrew from consideration to head the Drug Enforcement Administration. He said he decided to withdraw after the \u201cgravity of this important responsibility set in.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, arrives for a meeting with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito in the Russell Senate Office building on Capitol Hill on December 3.Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesHegseth faces key moment in Fox interviewHegseth\u2019s chances have hardly been helped by an email obtained by The New York Times in which his mother told him in 2018 that he was a man who \u201cbelittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego.\u201d (Penelope Hegseth has subsequently defended her son, first telling The Times that the email was written \u201cin anger, with emotion,\u201d and then defending his character on Fox News Wednesday morning. She has said she apologized in a follow-up email, though she did not elaborate in her interview on Fox.)The Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran is heading to his old patch at Fox News on Wednesday for an interview that hints at the building crisis around his hopes. (His mother is also slated to appear on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d) Trump will no doubt be watching one of his favorite channels to assess Hegseth\u2019s durability. And any questions about Hegseth\u2019s past and behavior will shed light yet again on the lack of vetting of some of Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks who were announced in a flurry as the nascent new administration aimed for a fast start.One key question is how much allegations of personal transgressions matter to Trump, who has faced his own allegations, all of which he\u2019s denied. The president-elect has been found liable for sexual abuse in a civil trial brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. The case of Gaetz may be instructive. It was no secret that the former Florida congressman was facing allegations, which he denied and over and in which he was not charged, of a sexual encounter with a minor. But when coverage of the issue turned into a major Capitol Hill battle over a House Ethics Committee report, his days were numbered, and he eventually withdrew his candidacy on the grounds that it was distracting from the president-elect.It became clear then that while Trump has built a Teflon hide that allows him to defy political gravity, some of his acolytes who model their political careers on his example lack his legendary impunity.And one aspect of Hegseth\u2019s story might give Trump pause, concerning allegations of past intoxication. The president-elect is a famous abstainer and has spoken about how alcoholism helped kill his brother, Fred. He \u201chad the best personality, better than mine, but he had a problem with alcohol and he would tell me \u2018don\u2019t drink, don\u2019t drink,\u2019\u201d Trump said in 2017.Hegseth confirmation will be \u2018difficult\u2019Pressure around Hegseth\u2019s nomination mounted after senators returned from the Thanksgiving holiday.South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a frequent Trump golf partner and military veteran, warned that some of the allegations about Hegseth were \u201cgoing to be difficult.\u201dIowa Sen. Joni Ernst, another veteran who has been mentioned as a possible alternative defense secretary pick, said she\u2019d have \u201ca really frank and thorough conversation\u201d with Hegseth. And Louisiana Republican Sen. Jon Kennedy said he\u2019d read all the articles and allegations about Hegseth and he was \u201cgoing to have to address them.\u201d Kennedy pointed to the email that Hegseth\u2019s mother reportedly sent her son \u2014 \u201cOf all the allegations I\u2019ve seen that\u2019s probably the most serious,\u201d he said.Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming said Hegseth needed to address the latest allegations, and Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma said he believed it was \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201cfair\u201d to ask about allegations that Hegseth was intoxicated at work events. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, meanwhile, acknowledged that some of his colleagues were \u201cvery worried\u201d about Hegseth\u2019s qualifications \u2014 but urged them to hear him out in a confirmation hearing.So far, only a small minority of Republican senators have raised questions about Hegseth. Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, for instance, told reporters Monday that he\u2019d talked to Trump\u2019s Pentagon pick about misconduct allegations and \u201cthere\u2019s not going to be anything to this at the end of the day.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump's secretary of Defense pick Pete Hegseth meets with Sen. Tommy Tuberville on Capitol Hill on December 2.Samuel Corum/Getty ImagesBut confirmation processes gather their own momentum in one way or the other, and the public comments made by some Republican senators look a lot like coded messages of concern to Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort. After all, Trump could find another defense secretary designate who might be almost as adept at fighting culture wars inside the Pentagon as Hegseth but who might not draw attention away from the shock-and-awe start to his administration that Trump is planning.New controversy over Hegseth came on a day when the Trump transition entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Justice Department. This move would pave the way for candidates for Cabinet jobs to undergo FBI background checks in order to receive security clearances. This does not necessarily mean that the president-elect will require such vetting for all his picks. But several Republican senators said they hoped such steps would be taken, especially in the case of Hegseth.\u201cI believe that we need an FBI background check to evaluate the allegations,\u201d Maine Sen. Susan Collins told CNN on Tuesday, adding that Hegseth should also complete the usual questionnaire about his background and participate in a public hearing.If he fails to win confirmation, Hegseth wouldn\u2019t be the first Republican defense secretary pick to see his candidacy founder over allegations involving women and drinking. In 1989, the Senate balked at confirming one of its own, John Tower of Texas, after he was asked to run the Pentagon by President George H.W. Bush.CNN\u2019s Manu Raju asked North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer whether standards had changed since those days.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much question that the tolerance for certain things has changed,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cIn many respects, grace abounds all the more. And I think that\u2019s not such a bad thing. That\u2019s why, I mean, I love a good redemption story, and I hope that\u2019s what Pete has.\u201dThis story has been updated with additional reporting."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Macron\u2019s Paris invite shows power fast flowing from Biden to Trump", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/politics/donald-trump-emmanuel-macron-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014There\u2019ll be a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu whenFrench President Emmanuel Macronlays the flattery on thick for Donald Trump in Paris this weekend.Few foreign leaders did more to woo Trump when he was the 45th president. In fact, Macron treated him with such deference at a Bastille Day parade on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es that Trumpcame home wanting a military parade of his own\u2014 on July Fourth.As Trump prepares to become the 47th president, Macron has surpassed himself,inviting Trumpto attend the year\u2019s most vaunted opening \u2014 the unveiling of the newly restored Notre Dame Cathedral five years after a savage fire.Putting Trump at the center of the star-studded VIP event, which will mark his big return to the global stage, says everything about the power fast flowing back to the president-elect six weeks before he begins his second term.Trump isn\u2019t waiting until January to launch his new foreign policy \u2014 he\u2019s already threatened a trade war with Canada and Mexico and showed who is boss when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rushed to Florida to appease him last week. And on Monday, he warned that there will be \u201cALL HELL TO PAY\u201d in the Middle East if Hamas doesn\u2019t release hostages in Gaza before Inauguration Day.Trump\u2019s starring role in Paris will also mark a poignant contrast with Joe Biden\u2019s increasingly ignominious long goodbye. The president came under fierce criticism Monday, even from within his own party, after he pardoned his son Hunter, undercutting a core principle of his term \u2014 that everyone is equal before the law.\u201cHe didn\u2019t need to tell the American public, \u2018I will not do this\u2019 and he did \u2026 and when you made a promise, you gotta keep it,\u201d Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney added: \u201cIt was a terrible decision and it just made me heart sick.\u201dThe announcement of Trump\u2019s trip to Paris came as Biden landed in Angola for an official presidential visit that is sure to include far more substance than Trump\u2019s journey. The president seeks to highlight US commitment to sub-Saharan Africa in the face of China\u2019s investment-led regional power play. Trump never made it to Africa as president and seemed more interested in insulting the continent than helping it. Biden\u2019s visit will also showcase one of the most successful US global policies in decades \u2013 the massive program fighting HIV/AIDS in Africa that faces an uncertain future when Trump returns to the White House.But the president-elect\u2019s far more visible jaunt to the City of Light will stress how he is again the American that foreign leaders want to court as Biden increasingly fades from the international scene.Trump\u2019s win presented every global leader with a dilemmaPerhaps most significantly, Trump\u2019s trip will highlight the dilemma with which every world leader is wrestling: how to deal with a new American president who is certain to be more aggressive and capricious on the world stage than he was even in his first turbulent term \u2014 and who often prefers the company of tyrants over allies.The president-elect is reveling in his return to the international spotlight after news broke of Macron\u2019s invitation Monday. \u201cPresident Emmanuel Macron has done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.The trip promises all that the president-elect most appreciates. A chance to seize the spotlight; the adulation of being an honored guest; and the fanfare of being part of a unique spectacle likely to attract millions of eyeballs across the globe.It\u2019s also the kind of eye-catching gambit for which Macron is known \u2014 but that sometimes comes unstuck. The French president\u2019s impulsive gesture earlier this year, for example, to call snap parliamentary elections backfired spectacularly and plunged the country into a governing crisis.France's President Emmanuel Macron talks to French media in Buenos Aires province on November 17.Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty ImagesMacron\u2019s invitation is the latest move in the never-ending tussle among European powers to be Washington\u2019s top conduit on the other side of the Atlantic. Macron has long sought to position France as the dominant European power \u2014 especially since the retirement of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was promoting her memoirs in Washington on Monday night alongside former President Barack Obama, who in 2016urged her to save the West from Trump.Trump\u2019s second coming has sparked a similar sense of crisis among Western powers, who are worried that he will desert Ukraine in order to please his friend, Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid rising expectations that the president-elect will threaten massive tariffs against the European Union. There\u2019s also concern that Trump will fracture NATO in his second term, after he said on the campaign trail that he\u2019d tell Russia it could do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to alliance members that don\u2019t meet guidelines for minimum defense spending.Macron, by deploying the power of symbolism and pulling off the coup of a first foreign visit even before Trump retakes office, seems to have a head start on his rivals. There\u2019s little competition from Germany, where Chancellor Olaf Scholz seems destined to soon follow Biden into the political wilderness after the collapse of his governing coalition with an election set for February. New British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is stronger but has a balancing act as Trump is deeply unpopular in his ruling Labour Party. And Britain lacks European clout after it left the EU in a populist outburst that delighted Trump and foreshadowed his 2016 victory. In a major foreign policy speech on Monday night, Starmer rejected the idea that the United Kingdom must pick between its friendships with the United States and Europe \u2013 a choice some observers fear Trump might force it to make. He also recalled his meeting with Trump in September, weeks before the US election. \u201cWhen President Trump graciously hosted me for dinner in Trump Tower, I told him that we will invest more deeply than ever in this transatlantic bond with our American friends in the years to come,\u201d Starmer said.Macron, hugely unpopular deep into his second term, is not the force he once was either. His invitation to Trump is rich in irony since the far-right Trump-friendly National Rally Party is threatening to topple Prime Minister Michel Barnier in a move that would further weaken the president and cause even more disarray. There are growing signs that Macron\u2019s legacy might end up mirroring Biden\u2019s \u2014 as a president forced to hand over power to nationalist, populist forces he defined his administration as fighting against. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, whose anti-immigrant ideology is similar to Trump\u2019s, may have her best shot yet at making it through France\u2019s two-stage presidential election system to win power in 2027.How the first-term bromance went all wrongMacron\u2019s daring new overture to Trump is likely to trigger an outpouring of mutual praise. But if history is anything to go by, it won\u2019t last.The first time around, the Macrons and the Trumps dined at the Michelin-starred Jules Verne restaurant at the Eiffel Tower, whispered to one-another at the Bastille Day parade, then kissed and held hands at the White House. In the Oval Office in April 2018, Trump said, \u201cWe have to make him perfect, he is perfect,\u201d as he brushed what he said was dandruff off the French president\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEmmanuel will go down as one of your great presidents,\u201d Trump told the French people.From left to right, Brigitte Macron, President-elect Donald Trump, Melania Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron at Le Jules Verne Restaurant at the Eiffel Tower, on July 13, 2017.Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesThe bromance didn\u2019t last, however, as Trump\u2019s hostility to Europe got in the way. Things really went off the rails during a visit by the US leader to France later in 2018. Trump reacted poorly to Macron\u2019s push for a European army \u2014 ironically, a partial response to the US leader\u2019s frequent complaints about the need for American taxpayers to bankroll the continent\u2019s defense. Trump called the idea \u201cvery insulting,\u201d later mocked Macron\u2019s \u201cvery low approval rating in France, 26%\u201d and tweeted support for his nationalist foes.While Trump seems prepared to give it another shot, Macron \u2014 who, like Biden, styles himself as a protector of democracy and a bulwark against far-right nationalism \u2014 is far from the president-elect\u2019s favorite European leader. That honor belongs to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, a frequent guest at Mar-a-Lago, whose blueprint for eroding democracy, curtailing press freedom and politicizing justice is far more to Trump\u2019s taste. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like him because he\u2019s too strong,\u201d Trump said during a rally in New Hampshire during his primary campaign in January. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a strong man at the head of a country.\u201dStill, both Macron and Trump place great importance on relationships between foreign leaders \u2014 so perhaps they can rekindle the spark where it all began.Trump will arrive in Paris shortly after selecting Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of his daughter Ivanka as the next US ambassador to France. On the one hand, this pick might be seen by some as an insult to America\u2019s longest diplomatic friendship since Kushner was convicted of tax evasion and witness retaliation charges and was pardoned by Trump. But the French long ago perfected the art of diplomatic discretion, and in some ways, Kushner\u2019s selection might be seen as a compliment \u2014 he is, after all, family for Trump \u2014 and therefore has his ear.Kushner\u2019s appointment may also offer the chance of a reentry to high society, on the world\u2019s most glittering diplomatic circuit, for Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, who now live in Florida, far from their former haunts in Manhattan where the name Trump became anathema to elite liberal chattering classes.This story has been updated with additional details."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Biden\u2019s pardon of his son pours fuel on Trump\u2019s claims of politicized justice", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/02/politics/hunter-biden-pardon-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014PresidentJoe Biden\u2019s pardon of his son Hunter deepened an entanglement of politics and the rule of law that has tarnished faith in American justice and is almost certain to worsen inDonald Trump\u2019s second term.TheSunday evening movewas a stunning development since Biden came to office vowing to restore the independence of the Justice Department, which had been eroded during Trump\u2019s first term, and because he had repeatedly said he wouldn\u2019t pardon his son.President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden disembark from Air Force One in Syracuse, New York, on February 4, 2023.Elizabeth Frantz/ReutersRelated articleBiden\u2019s pardon of his son makes presidential historyNow, weeks before he leaves the White House, Biden has wielded presidential power to absolve his son ahead of sentencings later this month over a pair ofgunandtaxconvictions that emerged from the due process of law.His decision came days after special counsel Jack Smithmoved to dismissthe federal cases against Trump \u2014 over election interference and the hoarding of classified documents \u2014 on the grounds that presidents can\u2019t be prosecuted.Taken together, the convergence of legal controversies raises questions about the bedrock notion that underpins the system of justice in the United States that everyone \u2014 even presidents and their families \u2014 are equal before the law.Until Sunday, Biden had not intervened in the cases against his son, and the White House always insisted that he wouldn\u2019t, even though the shifting political environment caused by Trump\u2019s election victory last month seemed likely to shift his calculations. Biden started informing staff of his decision on Saturday evening, a source familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Arlette Saenz, and his team regrouped on Sunday morning to iron out the details.Massive political reverberationsPolitically, Biden\u2019s reversal may be seen as a stain on his legacy and his credibility. It contributes to an ignominious end for a presidency that dissolved in his disastrous debate performance in June and that will now be remembered as much for opening the way for Trump\u2019s return to the White House as evicting him four years ago.Rep. Glenn Ivey, a Maryland Democrat, acknowledged to Kasie Hunt on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d Monday that the pardon will be wielded politically against Democrats.\u201cI\u2019ve got mixed views about it, frankly,\u201d Ivey said.The president also may have offered an opening for Trump\u2019s party to rally behind Kash Patel,the loyalist whom the president-elect pickedSaturday evening to lead the FBI and serve as an apparent agent of his campaign of political retribution.There is no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the president. An impeachment inquiry by House Republicans that looked at Biden\u2019s and his son\u2019s business relationships \u2014 which Democrats saw as an attempt to inflict political damage ahead of the election \u2014went nowhere. And the cases against Hunter Biden lack the constitutional gravity or historic importance of theindictments against Trumpand his frequent attacks on the rule of law.President Joe Biden, wearing a Team USA jacket and walking with his son Hunter Biden, heads toward Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, July 26, 2024.Susan Walsh/APRelated articleJoe Biden\u2019s pardon reversal reflects family loyalty over legacyBut the political impact of Sunday night\u2019s drama could be profound. Already, Republicans are arguing the Hunter Biden pardon shows that the current president, and not the next one, is most to blame for politicizing the system of justice by meting out favorable treatment to his son. Their claim may not be accurate, but it can still be politically effective.Trump used pardons to protect multiple political aides and contacts during his first term,including his daughter\u2019s father-in-law, who\u2019s now hispick for ambassador to France. But any time in the future that Trump is criticized for his use of pardon power, he will be able to argue that Biden did the same to protect his own kin.This could be especially significant as Trump comes under pressure from supporters in the coming months to pardon those convicted of crimes related to the January 6, 2021, mob attack on the US Capitol \u2014 many of whomare still in jail.Yet Biden, after a life of tragedies and heartache, asked Americans tojudge him as a fatherwho was clearly worried about the impact of a potential jail term on his son, a recovering addict.Trump and Biden now both argue that the Justice Department was politicizedHunter Biden was convicted by a jury in June of illegally buying and possessing a gun after a trial that exposed his drug abuse and family dysfunction. He pleaded guilty in September to nine tax offenses, stemming from $1.4 million in taxes that he didn\u2019t pay while spending lavishly on escorts, strippers, cars and drugs.There is some validity to the president\u2019s claim in his Sunday statement that his son was \u201ctreated differently\u201d because of who his father is. Charges relating to the illegal possession of a firearm while being addicted to a controlled substance and regarding a false statement on the matter are quite rare, for instance. And Republican congressional probes into the matter, which imploded over a lack of evidence, looked like naked attempts to damage the president.Hunter Biden, son of U.S. President Joe Biden, departs federal court after a  plea hearing on two misdemeanor charges of willfully failing to pay income taxes in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. July 26, 2023. REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstJonathan Ernst/ReutersRelated articleREAD: Statement from President Joe Biden announcing the pardon of his son Hunter Biden\u201cNo reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter\u2019s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2014 and that is wrong,\u201d Joe Biden said in the statement. \u201cThere has been an effort to break Hunter \u2014 who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they\u2019ve tried to break me \u2014 and there\u2019s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.\u201dHis statement is extraordinary because Biden is now arguing something rather similar to Trump \u2014 that his own Justice Department has been unfairly politicized. Biden was referring to the way that the Hunter Biden case was handled by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed US attorney from Delaware who originally investigated the president\u2019s son and was later appointed as a special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland.Yet at the same time, Hunter Biden put himself in a position in which he created a political vulnerability and potential conflict of interest for his father. In addition, his business activities in Ukraine and China while his father was vice president and afterward raised serious ethical questions, even though Republicans have failed to produce evidence for claims that the current president benefited from the transactions.It is significant, therefore, that Joe Biden\u2019s pardon includes any activity by his son starting on January 1, 2014 \u2014 the year that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company \u2014 while his father, who was then vice president, was deeply involved in US policy toward Kyiv.While the pardon is its own distinct controversy, it may not have happened but for the extraordinary circumstances of a fraught political moment, with Trump due to return to power at noon on January 20.Kash Patel speaks during a campaign event for Republican election candidates at the Whiskey Roads Restaurant & Bar on July 31, 2022 in Tucson, Arizona.Brandon Bell/Getty Images/FileRelated articleTrump plans to replace current FBI director with firebrand Kash Patel, drawing bipartisan fireGiven the selection of Patel to head the FBI and Trump\u2019s second pick for attorney general,Pam Bondi, there are reasonable grounds to expect that Hunter Biden may have been among those whom the president-elect\u2019s loyalists were likely to target, given their vows to use their powers to go after his enemies.And now that he\u2019s acted to protect his son, Joe Biden may face calls to cast a much wider net with his pardon authority, perhaps to include prosecutors who worked on cases against Trump, including over his attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 election.The president-elect moved quickly to capitalize on the situation in a comment that will raise expectations that he will issue pardons for January 6 convicts shortly after he takes office again.\u201cDoes the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Sunday. \u201cSuch an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\u201dAnd Trump\u2019s Republican allies sought to use the situation to bolster the chances of Senate confirmation for some of his most provocative picks. \u201cDemocrats can spare us the lectures about the rule of law when, say, President Trump nominates Pam Bondi and Kash Patel to clean up this corruption,\u201d Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton wrote on X.No moral high ground for TrumpStill, the idea that there is any moral high ground for Trump \u2014 who issued a string of apparently politicized pardons during his first term \u2014 is risible. Just on Saturday, for example, the president-elect announced that he had chosen Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of his daughter Ivanka, to serve as ambassador to Paris. Trump had pardoned him for tax evasion, one count of retaliating against a federal witness \u2014 Kushner\u2019s brother-in-law \u2014 and another count of lying to the Federal Election Commission.Trump also issued pardons to other associates and people well connected with his family and his inner circle, including longtime fixer Roger Stone and 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Massad Boulos listens as Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign office on Friday, October 18, 2024, in Hamtramck, Michigan.Evan Vucci/APRelated articleTrump\u2019s extraordinary selection of his daughters\u2019 fathers-in-law for key posts underscores his reliance on family membersThe most recent cloud of politicization surrounding the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation dates to 2016 and then-FBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision to reopen an investigation into Democratic nomineeHillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email serverjust days before the election. Many Democrats blame his move for Clinton\u2019s defeat and have never regained their faith in the bureau.Then, the investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia soured many of the 45th president\u2019s supporters on the justice system. The probe culminated in theMueller report, which found that while the Trump campaign expected to benefit from Russian interference, there was no evidence to prove collusion.Trump\u2019s obsession with the FBI and the Justice Department, which produced his vows to enact retribution, only got worse when he was investigated and indicted over his election interference scheme and his hoarding of classified documents \u2014 both on the basis of voluminous and damaging evidence.If Trump responds to those who he claims weaponized the system against him with further weaponization, it could leave faith in the system irretrievably damaged in the eyes of millions of Americans for decades to come.This story has been updated with additional reporting."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Biden\u2019s pardon of his son makes presidential history", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/politics/joe-biden-presidential-history-pardon/index.html", "content": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s What Matters newsletter.

With the pardon, Biden broke a clear public promise not to interfere with the justice system on his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s behalf, something that will now stain his presidential legacy.Only two other presidents have pardoned family members, according to Alexis Coe, author of \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00f1\u222b Bill Clintonpardoned his half-brother Rogerfor drug charges.\u201a\u00f1\u222b Trumppardoned his son-in-law\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s father, Charles Kushner, who had been convicted of witness tampering, tax evasion and illegal campaign contributions.

Now, the risk is a normalization of pardons as a sort of perk of access.Interestingly, the family member pardon was not the most controversial for either Clinton or Trump.Clinton\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pardon of thefugitive financierMarc Rich was more shocking than his pardon of his half-brother.Trump pardoned a long list of political allies, including his former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his former aide Steve Bannon, who was facing trial for defrauding investors in a private border wall. Bannon later was convicted andserved time in jailon separate federal charges related to his refusal to comply with a congressional subpoena. He alsofaces state chargesrelated to the alleged private border wall scheme.Now the debate over presidents and justice will pivot from the fact that Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s election erased many of his legal problems to Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to erase his own son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s legal woes after Democrats\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 devastating loss.

But in the case of his son, he said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a severe indictment of the justice system at a time when Trump is promising to significantly change things, includingputting loyalists in chargeof the Department of Justice and the FBI.

NO COMMERCIAL OR EDITORIAL SALES IN CHINAChina Daily/ReutersRelated article3 charts that help explain how Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s tariffs would workAfter an election where many voters thought they were voting for cheaper goods, the future president is essentially promising to raise prices on things like groceries, electronics and automobiles and potentially kick off a trade war with two of the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s closest trading partners.The tariffs might also violate the very trade agreementTrump negotiated with Mexico and Canadaduring his first term.Are these new threats a bargaining tactic meant to bring the countries to the table on immigration, or are they real promises? We shall see in time. Meanwhile, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s worth looking at why Trump can impose these tariffs without input from Congress.This is not what the Constitution envisionedAfter all, the Constitution specifically gives Congress, not the president, the power to \u201a\u00c4\u00faregulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9How does Trump have the power to impose tariffs without any input from Congress? It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pretty much the opposite of what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s in the Constitution, and it didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t happen right away.For insight, I talked to Doug Irwin, an economics professor at Dartmouth College and the author of multiple books about tariffs and trade policy, including \u201a\u00c4\u00faTrade Policy Disaster: Lessons from the 1930s.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Smoot-Hawley tariffs exacerbated the Great DepressionIn the years after World War I, Congress had embraced isolationism and imposed tariffs on imports into the US as a way to protect US companies and workers from competition. As the Great Depression was beginning, Congress went back to this tool and imposed a law named for then-Sen. Reed Smoot of Utah and then-Rep. Willis Hawley of Oregon. The additional across-the-board tariffs in theSmoot-Hawley Actkicked off a trade war that exacerbated the Great Depression.After Franklin D. Roosevelt took office along with a Democratic majority, lawmakers corrected in the other direction. In 1934, they passed theReciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which gave the president power to lower import duties for countries with which the US had trade agreements.In the 1960s, presidents got power from Congress to impose tariffs for national security reasons, something Trump made use of during his first term when dealing with China, Europe, Canada and Mexico.Irwin said it could take some time for Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Commerce Department to conduct that investigation and determine there is a national security threat from Canada and Mexico, but it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also possible Trump could try to sidestep such a report.In the 1970s, Congress gave the president new trade promotion authority power to negotiate trade agreements and then have Congress ratify them without amendment. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s something lawmakers have granted at key moments in the years since,including in 2015, when a much more free trade-oriented GOP gave then-President Barack Obama authority to negotiate with a group of countries in the Pacific region.Trump later killed that deal, but heused the fast-track authorityto negotiate the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement he may now violate with new tariffs.Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s tariffsFor tariffs, Trump has instead focused on that1962 law, which requires a report from his administration justifying tariffs as a national security matter but does not require a vote by Congress. Notably, President Joe Biden maintained Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first-term tariffs on China and evenincreased some.Workers stand in front of coils of steel wire at a depot on the outskirts of Shanghai on March 26, 2018.Qilai Shen/Bloomberg/Getty Images/File\u201a\u00c4\u00faCongress, basically starting in the 1930s, almost a century ago, has started giving away a lot of its tariff authority,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Irwin said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd so now we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in a situation where the president is really sort of the main driver on trade policy, and Congress, even though the Constitution gives it most of the authority, is in the back seat.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9If all of this sounds a little familiar, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s because Trumpultimately lifted tariffs he imposed on steel and aluminumfrom Canada and Mexico in 2019, on the way to finalizing that trade agreement.\u201a\u00c4\u00f2We know what works\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s aides see the first administration\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s tactics as a model for Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second administration, according to CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Priscilla Alvarez, who reports these threats are part of an effort to resurrect an old approach and do it early on.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe know what works,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 a Trump transition official told Alvarez.Alvarez adds there is belief among those in his orbit that the threats worked the first time in getting neighboring countries to comply on migration.

Vice President Kamala Harris, on the other hand, underperformed by about 6.8 million votes compared with Joe Biden in 2020, according to CNN election results as of November 25.Here are seven charts and maps that explain how the US popular vote, turnout in individual states and ultimately turnout in the seven key battleground states \u201a\u00c4\u00ec where electoral votes were up for grabs \u201a\u00c4\u00ec tell the story of Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 loss.This year will end up being one of just two elections in the 21st century in which the Republican presidential candidate got more votes than the Democratic candidate. It is also one of only two times in the 21st century that the number of votes cast dropped compared with the previous presidential election. The other came in 2012, when about 2.2 million fewer votes were cast than in 2008.Another way to look at Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s narrow edge in the popular vote is that he got the vote of about a third of the citizen voting-age population. A slightly smaller portion backed Harris. Another third did not vote at all.While Democrats\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 portion of the vote has been up and down in recent elections, Trump has won more votesin each of the elections in which he was a candidate. Viewed in raw numbers, he got about 63 million votes in 2016, 74 million in 2020 and nearly77 million in 2024.The difference for Democrats was that turnout surged in 2020, the pandemic election.Harris got fewer votes than Biden in 45 of the 50 states and Washington, DC. While votes are still being added to the totals in some states, changes at this point would be marginal.Most of Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 drop-off came in populous states like California, New York and Florida, where a dip in support for Harris did not affect the Electoral College vote tally. Trump boosted his overall count in those population centers as well, padding his count by hundreds of thousands of votes in Texas, Florida and New York and to a lesser extent in traditional Democratic strongholds like New Jersey and Massachusetts.Zooming in on the hotly contested battleground states where the election was much closer, Harris and Trump both gained votes compared with 2020 in Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada. The population has also grown in all of those states in the past four years.Arizona\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s population has also grown, though the total number of votes cast in the state held about even. Harris got fewer votes there compared with Biden in 2020, and Trump carried it with his largest margin of victory across the seven battlegrounds.Pennsylvania and Michigan are battleground states where the population has not grown in the past four years and where Harris got fewer votes in 2024 than Biden got in 2020.Democrats lamenting the results have pointed out that the election was decided by about 230,000 votesin Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, battleground states won narrowly by Trump. But Harris lost votes compared with Biden across the country.Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 losses compared with Biden were biggest in Southern California, southern Florida and in the Northeast. The few places where Harris got more votes than Biden were largelyconcentrated in those seven battleground states, in particular Georgia and North Carolina, but it wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t enough to overcome Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gains. The only state where Harris gained votes on Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2020 performance, that was not also a battleground state, was Utah.Trump made gainsacross the seven battleground states in particular, but they weren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t limited to places with higher turnout. Trump also saw increases in support in a range of counties where fewer votes were cast overall.In Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, even in many counties where more people voted in 2024, Harris got fewer votes than Biden in 2020, although there were pockets in the swing states where Harris got more votes than Biden.Perhaps it shouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be surprising that in the states where the campaign was the most hotly contested, more people voted in 2024, whereas in states where one side or the other seemed more likely to win, turnout generallydropped."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump\u2019s trade threats put the world on a precipice and may say a lot about his second term", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/27/politics/trump-trade-threat-second-term-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Global chaos delivered via social media is back.Between 2017 and 2021, Donald Trump had the world on a precipice, bracing for his next move, gaming out whether his bluster was a bluff, an overture to a deal or a break with history, as he sowed mayhem to push adversaries off balance.President-elect Donald Trump attends the America First Policy Institute gala at Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on November 14.Carlos Barria/ReutersRelated articleTrump tries to force other countries to negotiating table on immigration and trade with promise to hike tariffsThose days are here again, nearly eight weeks before his second term begins.The president-elect\u2019sonline threatsMonday of new trade wars with Canada, Mexico and China turned the United States back into an agent of instability, which can pitch a foreign friend or foe into a crisis in an instant.Trump said America\u2019s two Western Hemisphere neighbors would be punished if they didn\u2019t stop the flow of undocumented migration and fentanyl across their borders. And he demanded China stop shipments of the drug as well.His first major global brouhaha since winning reelection posed the following questions that will help define the character of his second term.Is Trump serious about massive tariff hikes that could increase prices for US consumers as soon as he begins a second presidency, which was won partly because voters were so frustrated with inflation and costs of housing and groceries?Or is the president-elect indulging his view that life and politics is one big real estate deal? And is he setting out an extreme position to create leverage for agreements that might be modest but polish his dealmaker\u2019s brand?There\u2019s a third possibility \u2014 that Trump feels liberated by his election victory and is determined to drive his America First project further than a first term in which his most volatile instincts were often restrained by establishment aides.Trump believes he has mandate for huge changeMany of Trump\u2019s voters deeply disdain the political, economic, trading and diplomatic systems that they believe have hurt them financially and serve US and global elites. They want their MAGA hero to tear them down, without much idea what would replace them.Trucks wait on a queue to cross to the US next to the border wall at the Otay commercial crossing port in Tijuana, Baja California state, Mexico on November 26, 2024.

Or he could have something more sweeping in mind. The second path could take America and the world into risky territory. The idea that he might go for broke could drag the US into trade wars that wreck the economy and spark dangerous standoffs in a world that is far more volatile since he left office four years ago.\u201cThere are plenty of examples (of) Trump\u2019s verbal threats forcing and compelling action on the part of other parties, particularly when it comes to foreign countries,\u201d Pete Seat, a former spokesman in President George W. Bush\u2019s White House, said on \u201cCNN News Central\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cThe real question is what will happen in these next two months?\u201d If all three nations make meaningful moves, Seat said, \u201cTrump may back off on this. Otherwise, we\u2019re all going to see price increases.\u201dThe issue of whether Trump is bluffing or is planning to go all in with a revolutionary presidency is not confined to trade.He has ambitious plans to gut the federal government with a new effort co-chaired by Elon Musk. But going all in would cause huge political and economic disruption that might backfire. Similarly, Trump vowed a mass deportation of up to 10 million undocumented migrants. But such an operation that would cost billions of dollars could buckle the agricultural sector and would also come with high political costs. This equation is mirrored abroad. Some in the West fear Trump will pull the US out of NATO or refuse to defend an alliance member attacked by Russia. Would the president-elect really blow apart the most successful military alliance in history \u2014 or is he just trying to wring more defense spending from some of Europe\u2019s lagging powers?In other words, does Trump have in mind a presidency driven by spectacle and brinkmanship that succeeds, like his first, in delivering mostly incremental change? Or is he really, as some of his fans want, trying to tear everything down?Video Ad FeedbackEnten explains how Americans view tariffs01:33- Source:CNNA quick startTrump\u2019s sudden warning on Monday of 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, with a further 10% hike above existing tariffs on Chinese goods, was the latest sign that the president-elect plans to quickly throw his muscle around.It caused a scramble in Ottawa, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jumped on the phone with Trump for what he insisted was a \u201cgood call.\u201d Within hours, Trump had got the attention of new Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, as she warned of like-for-like retaliation of Trump tariffs after January 20.The president-elect\u2019s gambit has created an immediate yard stick to judge whether his second presidency will be an attempt to push through far deeper disruption.There\u2019s no guarantee that Canada, Mexico and China will back down immediately.Still, deaths from overdoses of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are falling. And Trump\u2019s promises to impose hardline immigration policies are likely to deter many migrants from approaching the US southern border. Therefore, Trump could create an illusion of change to cover a decision to back down if he needs to.Trump\u2019s trade war rhetoric is a reminder that in his worldview, the United States has few friends \u2014 only adversaries against whom it can choose to win or lose. According to this view, it\u2019s fine for a big powerful country like the US to use its natural advantages to push around smaller neighbors, even if they are allies.But Trump must also size up his opponents both north and south of the border.Trudeau is politically weakened, and his Liberals are in danger of losing a general election due next year to Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre. The prime minister therefore has a huge incentive to avoid a trade war that could cause havoc in the Canadian economy. Both Canada and Mexico are dependent on their trade with the United States because of their geographical realities and may have no choice but to make concessions. But Sheinbaum is new in office, has plenty of political capital and may be keen to stand up to perceived bullying by a new US president.The case of China is distinct from Trump\u2019s threats to Canada and Mexico. The president-elect significantly stiffened policy toward America\u2019s new superpower rival in his first term. A trade war led to a deal, which again Trump hailed, but that largely dissolved during the pandemic and after China declined to buy the vast quantities of agricultural goods that the then-president said it would.Trade is only one source of friction between Washington and Beijing, and many of Trump\u2019s team \u2014 including Sen. Marco Rubio, his pick for secretary of state \u2014 believe that China poses an existential security and economic threat to the United States. This then could be the first salvo in a large and more intense period of confrontation across the Pacific rather  than merely a ruse to draw President Xi Jinping to the table.Other tensions are inevitableTrump\u2019s early turn against his neighbors will put other allies on notice \u2014 especially in Europe, where leaders are bracing for their own trade showdown with Trump, as well as dealing with tensions over how to end the war in Ukraine.Initial reaction to Trump\u2019s broadside against Canada and Mexico suggests that many observers see his outburst as a negotiating tactic. A Trump transition officialtold CNNon Tuesday, \u201cWe know what works.\u201d In his first term, Trump used the threat of a trade war to force Canada and Mexico to the table to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement was touted by Trump as a triumph \u2014 but it didn\u2019t fundamentally reshape the global economy or significantly improve a hollowed-out US industrial base that Trump pledged to revive in his 2016 and 2024 campaigns.It\u2019s a measure of his desire to foment discord that Trump is effectively threatening to tear up one of his own first-term achievements.\u201cWhat Donald Trump is proposing as an alpha-disrupter is to disrupt the largest trade market in the world,\u201d Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat, told CNN on Tuesday.Is he serious?Thanks to Trump\u2019s early setting of expectations, the world will soon find out."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Why green investments have become the last line of defense for Biden\u2019s climate agenda", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/26/politics/green-investments-red-states-biden-trump-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Can the green shoots of clean energy break through the \u201cbrown blockade\u201d?The brown blockadeis the phrase I\u2019ve used to describe the hardening tendency of the states most deeply integrated into the existing oil and gas economy, as either major producers or consumers of fossil fuels, to support Republican presidential and congressional candidates who are resolutely opposed to federal action to combat climate change.Those states moved sharply towardDonald Trumpand the GOP in this month\u2019s election. The president-elect won a stunning 26 of the 27 states whose economies are the most reliant on the fossil fuels that produce the carbon emissions driving global climate change. Each of the GOP\u2019s four Senate pickups also came in those higher-carbon states.In the campaign, Trump promised to take a wrecking ball to virtually all of PresidentJoe Biden\u2019s efforts aimed at reducing carbon emissions and accelerating the shift from fossil fuels to lower-carbon alternatives. The critical role that the states most tightly bound into the existing fossil fuel economy played in both Trump\u2019s victory and the GOP\u2019s success in recapturing the Senate, will only encourage him in that direction.CNNRelated articleIt\u2019s not just Democrats \u2014 Republicans are working to Trump-proof their climate moneyThe only dynamic that might complicate that offensive, even at the margins, may be the green shoots sprouting across large swathes of red America. This torrent of new investments in wind and solar power, the semiconductors used in clean energy, and especially electric vehicles and their batteries \u2013 triggered by the Inflation Reduction Act and other economic development bills signed by Biden \u2013 has flowed disproportionately into Republican-held states and congressional districts.Those huge current and planned investments in new manufacturing plants may represent the sole opportunity to preserve any elements of Biden\u2019s blueprint for growing the domestic clean energy industry.\u201cThe beauty of the Inflation Reduction Act is that there is a built-in defense system,\u201d said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, an environmental advocacy group. \u201cTo pull a quote from the \u201990s, \u2018It\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u2019 There\u2019s hundreds of thousands of new jobs that have been created. Manufacturing is back in the United States. There\u2019s nothing ideological about those jobs. Many of those clean energy workers voted for Trump, I have no doubt.\u201dThe relationship between fossil fuels and red statesAs I\u2019ve written before, the broadest measure of states\u2019 integration into the fossil fuel economy is theanalysis by the federal Energy Information Administrationof how much carbon each state emits in its energy consumption for each dollar of economic output that it produces. The top of that list is centered on two groups of states. One consists of the large producers of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas (including Wyoming, Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, Alaska, Montana, Oklahoma and Texas); the other big group is states that are large consumers of fossil fuels because they have either robust agricultural sectors (such as Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas) or big manufacturing industries (such as Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin). Whether as consumers or producers, the high-carbon states are predominantly located in the center of the country.The states that emit the least carbon per dollar of economic output are mostly coastal states that produce little oil, gas or coal and have transitioned more rapidly into the post-industrial economy of services and high-tech jobs, such as Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, Maryland, Washington, Oregon and California (which does produce some natural gas).Throughout the 21st century, the high-carbon states have become the foundation of the GOP\u2019s geographical strength in both the Senate and the Electoral College.The Republican dominance of those states dramatically solidified in 2024.After the 2024 election, Republicans now hold 37 of the 40 Senate seats in the 20 states that emit the most carbon per dollar of economic activity, per the Energy Information Administration. That\u2019s up substantially from the GOP\u2019s control of 32 of the 40 seats from the highest-emitting states after Trump\u2019s first election in 2016.Three of the Senate seats Republicans this year flipped from Democratic control rank in the top 20 highest-emitting states: West Virginia, Montana and Ohio, all of which have trended sharply toward the GOP over roughly the past 15 years. The fourth Democratic-held Senate seat Republicans captured was in the battleground of Pennsylvania, which ranks 27thin emissions per dollar of output, just above the national average.Across those 27 states with the highest carbon intensity in their economies, Republicans now control 48 of the 54 Senate seats. (The only Democratic senators in those states are two each in New Mexico and Michigan, as well as Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and John Fetterman in Pennsylvania.)The partisan balance is almost inverted in the remaining 23 states with the lowest level of carbon emissions per dollar of output: Democrats hold 41 of those 46 Senate seats, and Republicans just five. The two parties thus present an almost mirror image across this carbon divide: Ninety-one percent of all Republican senators come from the high-carbon states, while 87% of Democratic senators are elected by the lower-carbon states.The presidential race tells the same story. Among the 27 states with the highest level of carbon emissions per dollar of economic output, Trump lost only New Mexico. That restored the president-elect\u2019s dominance of the high-carbon states to its level in 2016 (when he also won 26 of the 27 highest-emitting states) after Biden held Trump to just 23 of the top 27 states in 2020.The three former \u201cblue wall\u201d Rust Beltstates that Trump recaptured in 2024 \u2013 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 all rank among those higher-emitting states.As in the Senate, Democrats dominate the lower-emitting states: Kamala Harris won 18 of the 23 on the bottom of the list, including all 11 states with the absolute lowest level of emissions.The politics of energy isn\u2019t necessarily the decisive factor in determining the partisan tilt of most of these states. The high-carbon states also usually have other characteristics that lean them toward the GOP. Most, for instance, have fewer racial minorities, immigrants and college-educated information-economy workers than the national average and more evangelical Christians and rural residents. The low-carbon states present the opposite picture on all of those dimensions.But whether or not energy policy is the principalcauseof the electoral divergence between high- and low-carbon states, theeffectis unmistakable. The low-carbon states tend to elect Democrats who back measures to advance the transition to a low-carbon energy supply and combat climate change. The high-carbon states overwhelmingly vote for Republicans who back expanded domestic production of oil and gas and who resolutely oppose federal action to reduce carbon emissions. That nearly indivisible phalanx of Republicans constitutes the\u201cbrown blockade\u201din Washington.Campaign contribution trends reinforce this pattern. As the debate over whether to respond to climate change has intensified over the past quarter-century, the oil and gas industry has shifted its giving almost entirely toward Republicans. In 1990, oil and gas interests split their political contributions about 2-to-1 toward the GOP. But in the last few election cycles, the oil industry has directed nearly 9 in 10 of its campaign dollars toward Republicans,according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign contributions and spending.Trumphas been especially close to midsize oil companiesthat remain focused almost entirely on drilling for oil and gas, as opposed to the multinational oil giants, such as ExxonMobil or Chevon, that have diversified more into lower-carbon energy sources. Chris Wright, Trump\u2019snominee for energy secretary, runs a company focused on fracking for natural gasand has flatly declared, \u201cThere is no \u2018climate crisis,\u2019\u201d and \u201cthe only thing resembling a crisis \u2026 is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.\u201dThese factors virtually ensure Trump will move to undo many Biden policiesopposed by the oil and gas industry. Trump, for instance, is likely to quickly begin the process of rescinding regulations the Environmental Protection Agency approved under Biden requiring auto companies and electric utilities to reduce their carbon emissions (by selling more electric vehicles and deploying more clean power, respectively). (Lee Zeldin, Trump\u2019s nominee to run the EPA,has saidhis priority for \u201cDay 1 and the first 100 days\u201d will be \u201cto roll back regulations.\u201d) And Trump will likely move rapidly to end theBiden administration\u2019s hold on exports of liquified natural gasand to make more public lands, both on- and offshore, available for oil and gas drilling.What will Trump do to clean energy?But while Trump is certain to take wide-ranging steps toboostthe oil and gas industry, it\u2019s an open question how far he will go to alsohobbleits competitors in the emerging clean energy space.Revoking the Biden EPA regulations for clean cars and electricity will hurt alternative energy producers by reducing demand. But, experts agree, the biggest blow Trump could strike against the growing clean energy industries would be to repeal the interconnected tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act that promote both the production and consumption of low-carbon alternatives.As Congress considers the future of those incentives, the growing importance of clean energy industries in Republican-leaning states and congressional districts could complicate the political equation for GOP lawmakers, even those who represent high-carbon states.An exclusive recent CNN analysis of datafrom the nonpartisan Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for instance, found that nearly four-fifths of the $243 billion in clean energy projects that are either completed or under construction are sited in GOP-held congressional districts. Republican districts are slated to receive an equally large share of another $435 billion in clean energy projects that have been announced but not yet built, the analysis found.A solar farm built by Rosendin Electric is seen on August 14, 2024, in Liverpool, Texas.Elizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle/Getty ImagesIn another recent analysis, Climate Power found Trump won 9 of the 10 states that since passage of the IRA have received the most new investment in manufacturing facilities for clean energy and semiconductors associated with those projects. (New York was the only exception.) Trump also won 7 of the 10 states that have seen the most new jobs created in those sectors since passage of the IRA, the analysis found. Eight of the states that rank in the top 10 for either new clean energy jobs or investment are also among the top 25 states that now emit the most carbon.If Trump and Congress repeal the IRA tax credits, \u201cI would expect to see announced manufacturing facilities \u2013 which are disproportionately [located] in Republican districts \u2013fold up,\u201d said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a group that works to unite environmentalists and labor unions. \u201cThese are not manufacturers who have economies of scale producing in this country yet. The idea was to give them a glide path with multiyear tax incentives, via the IRA. If that goes away, I think many of those facilities, if not most of them, go away.\u201dLodes noted that not only are most of the new clean energy investments flowing into red states, butresearch showsthat the new manufacturing plants are disproportionately sitting in economically distressed exurban and rural communities within those states. \u201cAre they really going to want to turn their backs on communities in their states that have been brought back?\u201d she asked. Moreover, she noted, given that Trump has committed to reducing Americans\u2019 energy costs, will he and GOP legislators \u201cwant to take energy off the board, which will just increase people\u2019s cost,\u201d by revoking the IRA subsidies triggering the clean energy manufacturing boom?Robert McNally, a Republican energy consultant who served as a White House adviser to President George W. Bush, believes the answer to Lodes\u2019 question will be a simple yes. He\u2019s dubious GOP legislators will fight to preserve many of the new IRA provisions beyond those benefiting a few energy options Republicans favor, such as nuclear power and carbon capture. Republicans, he believe, will also likely try to preserve some longer-standing incentives, like federal support for ethanol production.Beyond that, though, the sweeping new IRA incentives for producers and consumers of electric vehicles and solar and wind \u201cjust don\u2019t have deep roots,\u201d among Republicans, McNally said. The idea that auto companies \u201care building battery factories in, say, Georgia so therefore [Republicans from Georgia] will fight repeal of the IRA incentives \u2013 I don\u2019t see any sign of that.\u201dA Hyundai electric vehicle assembly and battery plant under construction in Ellabell, Georgia, September 9, 2023.Bloomberg/Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesCertainly Republicans have shown nothing but skepticism about the IRA so far. No Republican in either the House or Senate voted for the law when it passed Congress in 2022. After the GOP recaptured the House in 2023,every Republican representative votedto repeal it \u2013 even those whose districts were among the biggest beneficiaries of the new clean energy jobs and investments tied to the law.Still, environmentalists took heartfrom a letter 18 Republican House membersreleased in August expressing opposition to repealing the IRA\u2019s incentives for building new manufacturing plants \u2013 what they considered to be the first sign that the new jobs and investments might be softening ideological resistance to the law.Walsh said that in a stand-alone vote on the IRA\u2019s future, enough House Republicans might resist full repeal to protect the law \u2013 especially given the GOP\u2019s narrow majority.\u201cThe challenge we\u2019re facing is Trump and the GOP leadership in Congress is not going to present members with a simple up or down vote,\u201d Walsh said. Instead, he predicts, the administration will push to repeal key IRA provisions to partly offset the cost for \u201cthe trillions of dollars in tax cuts that is the highest priority for Trump and the GOP to pass. So in that context, which I\u2019m sure is the context we will face,the pressure on Republican lawmakers to redistribute money up to the wealthiest Americans is going to be enormous. And that will make the fight a hell of a lot harder.\u201dNo matter what happens to the IRA, experts agree that EVs and low-carbon power sources such as wind and solar will continue to expand their foothold because of technological advances and economic efficiencies.\u201cElectric vehicles are not Betamax,\u201d said University of California at Berkeley economist Joseph Shapiro, referring to a 1980s technology for recording television programs that was eclipsed by rival products. \u201cThis is not a technology that if it doesn\u2019t get a big (government) push it won\u2019t be adopted.\u201dFILE - California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks during a press conference in Los Angeles, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Thayer, File)Eric Thayer/APRelated articleCalifornia could keep the $7,500 EV credit alive if Trump kills the cost-saving measure, Newsom saysStill, Shapiro and others agree that government policy can enormously influence the pace of the transition from fossil fuels.In a recent paper, he and several colleagues calculated that repealing the IRA\u2019s $7,500 tax credit for purchasing a new electric vehicle, as Trump has pledged to do, would reduce the sales of new EVs by 27%. Domestically assembled EVs would suffer an even greater 37% decline, they forecast, because of the law\u2019s provisions benefiting vehicles built in the US.That\u2019s only one example of how the energy decisions made over the next four years could reverberate for decades. The US reliance on the fossil fuels driving climate change has been declining for years, but only at a modest pace. In 2000, fossil fuels provided 88% of the nation\u2019s energy,according to the Energy Information Administration; in 2023, the latest year for which figures are available, that number was 82.5%.Biden\u2019s agendawould unquestionably accelerate that change:The Rhodium Group has projectedthat if current policies remain in place, carbon-free sources within the next decade would provide three-fourths of the nation\u2019s electricity, while electric vehicles would comprise two-thirds to three-fourths of new car sales. In all, the group forecasts that under Biden\u2019s policies, fossil fuels over the next decade would fall to anywhere from 75% to as little as 58% of the nation\u2019s energy mix, according to Ben King, an associate director of Rhodium\u2019s climate and energy practice. That\u2019s a much faster pace of decline than in the past quarter-century.Even in that world, King notes, oil and gas producers are hardly facing an existential threat to their business in any medium-term time frame. \u201cIt is a more gradual energy transition than people initially think,\u201d King said.Yet interrupting that transition by repealing the federal policies benefiting clean energy remains a dangerous gamble. The result could be a vicious downward cycle: less investment in lower-carbon energy alternatives, which means less production, which yields fewer gains from advances in technology and manufacturing efficiency, which means less adoption, which translates into further reductions in clean energy investment and more years with fossil fuels entrenched as the nation\u2019s predominant energy source.All of that, in turn, would ensure years of greater carbon emissions \u2013 with ominous implications for extreme weather and other manifestations of climate change.\u201cIf the world adopts EVs in 2060 rather than 2020, it makes a giant difference for the planet because there is 40 years of burning gasoline rather than using a cleaner grid,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cSo the pace of adoption matters even if we end up at the same place in the end.\u201dThe brown blockade in Washington can\u2019t entirely stop the shift from fossil fuels to a low-carbon energy future \u2013 but, as the first months of Trump\u2019s second term may quickly demonstrate, it can significantly slow the change, and raise the cost of delay."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump\u2019s evasion of January 6 accountability will echo for next four years and generations to come", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/26/politics/trump-jack-smith-january-6-accountability-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Special counsel Jack Smith set out to prove in the United States of America v.

This is likely to reinforce Trump\u2019s belief that he will have almost unchecked authority and will therefore reverberate through the next four years and generations to come.And a president \u2013 who refused to accept the will of voters, the bedrock principle of democracy, after he lost an election and then told supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d before they invaded the US Capitol \u2013 will pay no lasting legal price.An unprecedented circumstanceSmith, in his downbeat legalese, sketched the enormity of America\u2019s reality.\u201cThe Department and the country have never faced the circumstance here, where a federal indictment against a private citizen has been returned by a grand jury and a criminal prosecution is already underway when the defendant is elected President.\u201d He added that Justice Department policy means the case cannot go ahead because the Constitution prohibits the indictment or prosecution of sitting presidents. But he also made clear that the outcome is not \u201cbased on the merits or strength of the case against the defendant.\u201dIn this January 6, 2021 photo, then-President Donald Trump speaks to supporters from The Ellipse near the White House in Washington, DC.Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleTakeaways from Trump\u2019s victories over special counsel Jack SmithIn other words, voters have elected a president under federal criminal indictment even though he is still accused of one of the most serious crimes against democracy in American history. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.And by voting the way they did, Americans effectively exonerated him in the federal cases \u2014 on charges that could have landed him in jail. Ironically, the very democracy that Trump had tried to subvert produced his legal deliverance.The cases were doomed anyway since Trump vowed to fire Smith as soon as he takes office.But Smith\u2019s move on Monday validated Trump\u2019s high-wire legal and political strategy, which involved repeated delays, sometimes with the help of conservative judges, and an absolute imperative to win the presidential election \u2014 a feat that looked unlikely when he was first charged.Special counsel Jack Smith delivers remarks on a recently unsealed indictment including four felony counts against Donald Trump in Washington, DC, on August 1, 2023.Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesWhat the thwarting of accountability meansThere will be short- and long-term consequences from Trump escaping accountability.His second term, which he already pledged to devote to \u201cretribution,\u201d has the potential to unfold in an even greater atmosphere of impunity than his first one.  After all, Trump enters office for the second time having seen that his method of testing the rule of law to its limits had little downside, aside from the symbolism of his second impeachment by the US House.\u201cFor Donald Trump, his strategy of delay, delay, delay and then win the election to do away with the litigation, proves to be one of the ultimate success stories,\u201d James Sample, a law professor at Hofstra University, told Julia Chatterley on \u201cFirst Move\u201d on CNN International. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a win in terms of avoiding accountability, which means it is a loss for the rule of law that it took so long to bring these cases to trial that they never in fact got to trial before the election.\u201dSmith\u2019s inability to bring the president-elect to account \u2014 for the most flagrant attack on the integrity of elections of modern times \u2014 will also echo down the ages.Many Republicans are convinced by now that Trump was unfairly targeted. But some future president, decades from now, might decide to meddle in the result of an election that they lost in the knowledge that a predecessor got away with it.Smith\u2019s gamble has failedIn Washington, Judge Tanya Chutkan, who was set to preside over the political trial of the century in the federal election interference case, quickly agreed to Smith\u2019s request to dismiss the case without prejudice \u2014 meaning that theoretically Trump could face the same charges again when he leaves office. But the chances of a revival of the trial in four years are far-fetched, even if a Democrat is in the White House.The folding of the federal prosecutions also poses searching questions for Smith and the Justice Department.Democrats have long complained that Attorney General Merrick Garland waited too long to appoint a special counsel to investigate Trump for his election meddling in 2020. After all, a congressional select committee under the previous Democratic House majority spent months probing the issue. The case might have come to trial had Garland moved more quickly. Certainly, there would have been more time for Supreme Court appeals to play out that Democrats thought were tainted by politicized delaying tactics by the conservative majority.There has all along been another profound consideration hanging over the case. Despite the horror of what unfolded on January 6, 2021, and the shock of a president using his vast powers to try to steal an election he lost, a decision to prosecute was always going to rock the nation and its tortured politics.Smith followed the evidence where he thought it led and secured indictments through grand juries who were convinced there was probable cause that criminal activity had occurred in both cases. That is standard prosecutorial practice.But even some legal scholars sympathetic to the idea that Trump should face accountability for trying to overturn an election wondered whether the legal theories on which Smith relied were somewhat novel. But how could they not be? No president before dared to do what Trump tried.And the business of putting a former president on trial was always going to raise a more acute dilemma: Was it really in the national interest to try to bring a former commander in chief into a courtroom trial, given the tumult such a crossing of the historic Rubicon was always destined to cause?At the same time, however, failing to act against an attempt to steal an election and the alleged unauthorized storage of classified documents would have enshrined an un-American principle that presidents can break the law but every other citizen cannot.It was not Smith\u2019s job to consider the political implications of his indictments. But charging Trump in two separate cases ahead of the election year, when the ex-president was already a candidate, was always going to stoke partisan uproar. There\u2019s a good argument that this course revived Trump\u2019s political career.The impact of the two federal cases \u2014 and two other prosecutions in a hush money case in New York, in which Trump was convicted, and another election interference matter in Georgia that is still awaiting trial \u2014 was to unify the Republican Party around Trump in the primary. By the general election, millions of Republican voters bought his argument that he was not only innocent but was effectively a dissident persecuted by a weaponized justice system. \u201cI\u2019m being indicted for you,\u201d he had said.Donald Trump appears in court for his hush money trial at Manhattan Criminal Court on May 30, in New York City.Steven Hirsch/Getty ImagesPerhaps Smith\u2019s cases would have been less politically radioactive had Trump not also faced multiple other cases. Trump\u2019s mug shot in the Georgia matter, for example, was a galvanizing moment for his supporters. And the spectacle of FBI agents searching his Florida club for classified documents provided a powerful image for a former president who declared he was unfairly prosecuted.The once-and-future president put the cap on his reality warping narrative that he was the victim, rather than the perpetrator, of election interference. \u201cIt was a political hijacking, and a low point in the History of our Country that such a thing could have happened, and yet, I persevered, against all odds, and WON. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.The Capitol will be the backdrop to Trump\u2019s validationFour years ago, a nation sickened by a once-in-a-century pandemic was being put through another ordeal because of one man\u2019s inability to face up to the fact that he lost the 2020 general election.So, it\u2019s worth going back to Smith\u2019s original indictment to recall the grave and unprecedented conduct that was charged in the election interference case and for which Trump will now almost certainly not be held accountable.\u201cThe Defendant lost the 2020 presidential election,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cDespite having lost, the Defendant was determined to remain in power. So, for more than two months following election day on November 3, 2020, the Defendant spread lies that there had been outcome-determinative fraud in the election and that he had actually won. These claims were false, and the Defendant knew that they were false. But the Defendant repeated and widely disseminated them anyway\u2014to make his knowingly false claims appear legitimate, create an intense national atmosphere of mistrust and anger, and erode public faith in the administration of the election.\u201dEven Trump\u2019s own Justice Department ruled that there was no meaningful fraud in the 2020 election that would have altered the result. Almost all of Trump\u2019s legal challenges failed, and Joe Biden was duly inaugurated, two weeks after his predecessor\u2019s crowd tried to halt the congressional certification of his victory.Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat who served as a lead counsel in Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial, said he understood why Smith had followed Justice Department guidance. But he also portrayed Trump\u2019s evasion of a trial as a dark day for America. \u201cI think this is a shame for justice in this country.

Why would you vote for a guy like that?\u201dThe response usually follows these lines, Boyer said: \u201cBecause he tells it like it is, and that resonates with me.\u201d\u2018The quiet resistance\u2019Boyer\u2019s suggestion to channel disappointment into activism is already part of Darrell Ann Murphy\u2019s post-election plan \u2014 one she adopted with friends after a few days of crying.\u201cFriends of mine have started groups, we\u2019re calling it the quiet resistance,\u201d Murphy said in an interview at her home in suburban Palmer Township, a short drive from Easton. \u201cWe still have a voice. This is, you know, November of 2024, we still have a voice, not sure about 2025, but this is still America.\u201dMurphy, 84, teaches the Chinese tile game Mahjong, and says she was blindsided by the election results \u2013 in Northampton County and nationally \u2013 because most of the fellow seniors taking classes were Harris supporters. Three weeks later, she\u2019s still trying to understand and is most worried about reproductive rights and a Trump tone Murphy sees as toxic.\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m going to be around,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI need to feel for my kids and grandchildren and the next generation, I need to feel some hope, some hope. Means more, means more to seniors. You know it really does.\u201dPennsylvania voters Darrell Ann Murphy, Pamela Aita and Catherine Long reflect on the outcome of the election over a game of Mahjong in Easton, Pennsylvania.CNNOur recent visit was the third time we sat in on a Mahjong game at Murphy\u2019s home \u2013 the third time she and Catherine Long sparred feistily with Pamela Aita, a Republican and Trump supporter.\u201cI don\u2019t have to have dinner with Donald Trump,\u201d Aita, 72, said when character questions came up. \u201cI don\u2019t care what he does. Just keep me safe, keep my grandkids safe, and have money in our pockets. That\u2019s all. That\u2019s what, that\u2019s my concern. I think the man can do that job. \u201cLong, 68, took issue.\u201cI have a problem having a man keep me safe who is a convicted felon and doesn\u2019t believe in the laws of the land,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m scared to death of what he\u2019s going to do.\u201dAita reminds her friends Trump was president before. \u201cDid anything horrible happen to the country?\u201d she asked.Long and Murphy said Trump was incompetent handling the Covid-19 pandemic.That they can spar, and smile, is sadly rare in today\u2019s polarized politics. Aita at first blames Trump\u2019s critics, but then agrees he, too, often stokes the fighting.\u201cI\u2019m saying both parties, both parties,\u201d she said. \u201cKnock it off. \u2026 Just let\u2019s all come together for this country. It\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t like the division and everything.\u201dMurphy can agree on that point.\u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is affecting every family, every friendship.\u201dBut the disagreement stirs again as Aita tries to wrap that point.\u201cWe have to just knock it off,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s president for four years. We\u2019ll have another election.\u201dLong interjects.\u201cWe hope,\u201d she said. \u201cI have fears that he won\u2019t leave.\u201dAita: \u201cCome on. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dLong: \u201cI\u2019m not kidding. I have fears that he won\u2019t leave.\u201dThe CNN visitor suggests it can be a topic of polite Mahjong debate for the next four years.\u201cIf we\u2019re still here on this earth,\u201d Murphy said.\u201cYes,\u201d Aita echoed. \u201cWe might not be here, John.

You can\u2019t even get pizza delivered where we live.\u201dKellerton is in Ringgold County, along the Iowa-Missouri border. Trump won 75% of the county vote. Ebersole said the reasons why are straightforward.\u201cCare about all of us, don\u2019t prioritize small individual groups first,\u201d she said. \u201cWe felt as though Washington and the far edges of our country were governing the rest of middle America.\u201dEbersole wasn\u2019t as bullish about Trump at the outset of the presidential campaign. Yes, she voted for him in 2016 and 2020, but she supported former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the Iowa caucuses because while she approves of most Trump policies, she believed it important that Republicans find a new leader who could be both president and role model.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t as respectful as I think our president should be,\u201d Ebersole told us when we first met in December 2023. \u201cBecause he didn\u2019t bring us together. Because of the divisiveness. Because of my liberal friends who were literally scared for their safety.\u201dOnce Trump clinched the nomination, Ebersole said her choice was easy because of Biden-Harris administration farm and climate policies she says punish small operators like her family business. \u201cThose policies made it a no-brainer for me,\u201d Ebersole said. \u201cMy only reticence was wanting to bring us together.\u201dNow, with Trump preparing to return to the White House, Ebersole again stressed her hope for a less confrontational politics. But her tone about Trump and the sources of division is different.\u201cThey are still scared,\u201d she said of her liberal friends. \u201cThe fear tactics of the left make them more afraid of Trump. \u2026 The point that I would really tell my liberal friends to understand is just because we voted in a very conservative president, that means that we don\u2019t want to put rules on you either. We just care about our own liberties.\u201dEbersole is among the voters who participated in ourAll Over the Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters in key voting blocs or from key campaign battlegrounds. Iowa was our first stop, back when the first question of the 2024 campaign was whether Trump retained his grip on the GOP. We visited three times during the campaign, and then returned after the election to get a sense of what these Republican voters want and expect when Trump returns to the White House in January.Ebersole said she hopes the president-elect reads his mandate as an urgent call to focus on the economy and immigration.\u201cDeportation is necessary because we have allowed way too many undocumented people to come in,\u201d Ebersole said. \u201cBut we also need a path, a path for those people to become Americans.\u201dShe is an unabashed fan of Trump\u2019s call for tariffs on foreign products.\u201cWhy are we bringing Argentinian beef in?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy are we bringing in New Zealand and Australian beef in and then exporting some of our beef? Why don\u2019t we first just feed our beef to our Americans?\u201dAnd she hopes Trump looks at his victory in the popular vote and understands that voters like her want him to set aside the campaign talk about rooting out \u201cthe enemy within\u201d or seeking retribution. \u201cWe are not letting him be a bully, but we want him to stand firm,\u201d she said.After considering Biden, she\u2019s trusting TrumpLike Ebersole, Betsy Sarcone began the election cycle believing it was time for Republicans to move on from Trump. She was so adamant that she initially said she would vote for President Joe Biden if it came down to a rematch of the 2020 race.\u201cI just can\u2019t put my rubber stamp on Trump having more influence over this country,\u201d Sarcone told us in August 2023. \u201cBecause I view Trump as not having any personal accountability.\u201dBut Sarcone viewed Vice President Kamala Harris as too liberal and inauthentic and ended up \u201cactually excited\u201d to cast her vote for Trump.\u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I don\u2019t love Donald Trump as a person, but I do think he is right for the country right now and that he is going to chart a different course.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m feeling relieved,\u201d she said in an interview at her home in suburban Des Moines last week. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s nice to not have to feel like you are silent anymore.\u201dThat last part is instructive; Trump\u2019s win in the popular vote alongside his battleground state sweeps is emboldening to his supportersJohn King pictured with Betsy Sarcone and her son.CNNWhen we first met Sarcone, Trump\u2019s toxic language and temper were reasons she cited in searching for a different Republican candidate. Now, though, when asked about Trump\u2019s angry words at campaign rallies, she offered a different take.\u201cWhat I see is him being mad at an open border, being mad at the crime rates, being mad at the economy,\u201d Sarcone said. \u201cI\u2019m completely OK with that.\u201dHer priorities: lower interest rates to help her real estate business, and lower grocery prices. \u201cI\u2019m a mom, single mother of three kids,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that does make a huge difference in my life.\u201dShe does not have amnesia about Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cWhen Trump gets off track, off his train of thought, that\u2019s when we get in trouble. If we are focused on the goals, focused on what we really need to fix this country, I think we are going to be OK,\u201d Sarcone said.Her patience is already being tested, though Sarcone said she has a different perspective on how to cope.Some early Trump Cabinet picks, especially former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, have triggered eye rolls or worse.\u201cNot necessarily excited,\u201d Sarcone said. \u201cWorried? I wouldn\u2019t say I am worried. \u2026 I\u2019m just going to put my trust in him at this point.\u201dShe stays calm by remembering she could not vote for Harris.\u201cI voted for change, as did the majority of people, and that is what we are going to get,\u201d Sarcone said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think worrying about it every day is going to do me any good.\u201dExcited for Trump even if business takes a hitChris Mudd is a Team Trump original \u2014 going back to 2015.He owns Midwest Solar and his vote could hurt his business; the startup has benefited from Biden administration clean energy incentives.\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Mudd said of taking a hit if Trump ends those incentives. \u201cI sell value. I sell saving money, not selling the green energy side of the business.\u201dBut he urged Trump to go full speed ahead, including with tariffs that could raise prices on Chinese components he needs for some big solar installations.\u201cMost of our stuff is tariff free,\u201d Mudd said in an interview at his Waterloo office last week. \u201cSo, I want to see more products and services get built in this country.

I never mentioned doing that, never even thought about such a thing,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the former presidentposted on XThursday.Facts First:Trump is trying to rewrite history. Repealing and replacing the landmark health reform law, popularly known as Obamacare, was among his top campaign promises when he first ran for president in 2016, and he spent the initial months of his term pushing Congress to pass legislation to do just that. Trump revived the idea early in the current campaign before backtracking. At September\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presidential debate with Harris, he called the Affordable Care Act \u201a\u00c4\u00falousy\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and said \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are working on \u201a\u00c4\u00fathings\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to replace it.Even before he ran for office, Trump was crusading on Twitter, now known as X, to repeal the law signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama.Duringhis 2016 campaign, he promised supporters that he would quickly dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Within hours of taking office in January 2017, he issued anexecutive orderaimed at rolling back the law.After the GOP-led House of Representatives passed a repeal bill in May 2017, Trump called them to the White House for a celebratory appearance and said Obamacare was \u201a\u00c4\u00faessentially dead.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is a great plan. I actually think it will get even better. This is a repeal and replace of Obamacare. Make no mistake about it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trump said.However, even though Republicans controlled Congress and the White House that year, they\u00ac\u2020failed to unite\u00ac\u2020behind a plan to do so, ending any serious attempts to completely jettison the Affordable Care Act. Trump spent the rest of his termchipping awayat the law.The former president revived the debate over the law\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fate in November 2023, when he\u00ac\u2020wrote\u00ac\u2020on his Truth Social platform that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faseriously looking at alternatives\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and that the failure to terminate it \u201a\u00c4\u00fawas a low point for the Republican Party, but we should never give up!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Trump has recently tried to change his tack \u201a\u00c4\u00ec promising to come up with a health care plan that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s better.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat we will do is we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re looking at different plans,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trump said at September\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s debate, noting that he had \u201a\u00c4\u00faconcepts of a plan.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faIf we can come up with a plan that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to cost our people, our population, less money and be better health care than Obamacare, then I would absolutely do it.

He has both come up with new falsehoods on pressing issues, most notably the federal response to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, and repeated old favorites about subjects he has been railing about since his 2016 presidential campaign.We went through the speeches Trump made at his two Wednesday campaign rallies in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, one in Scranton and one in Reading. In those two addresses alone, he uttered at least 40 separate false claims.Here is a fact check.FEMA and migrants: Trumpfalsely claimedof the Federal Emergency Management Agency: \u201cThey have no money. You know where they gave the money? To illegal immigrants coming in.\u201d He alsosaid, \u201cThey spent all their funds; they have no funds to take care\u2026\u201dThis is false in two ways. FEMA doeshave moneyfor the immediate responses to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, though a string of recent disasters has depleted its disaster relief fund; the fundhad about $11 billionremaining as of Wednesday. And FEMAdid notgive all of its disaster relief money to undocumented people; rather, as mandated by Congress, FEMA also administers an entirely separate pool of money for sheltering migrants.FEMA and employees: Trump added another false claim about FEMA,saying: \u201cThey have no workers, they have no nothing.\u201d FEMA hasmore than 20,000 employees.Harris and the response: Trump falselyclaimedthat as desperate people tried to survive Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, Vice President Kamala Harris \u201cdidn\u2019t send anything or anyone at all\u201d to help them. There were extensive federal and state rescue and relief efforts in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Helene. It\u2019s true that some residents died and others were stranded for days, but the state was not ignored by Harris or the Biden administration; North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, has repeatedlythankedPresident Joe Biden for his assistance.Schools and transgender children: Trump told a slightly vaguer version of his usualfalse storyabout schools supposedly obtaining or performing gender-affirming surgeries for transgender children behind their parents\u2019 backs,saying, \u201cYour child go goes to school, and they take your child. It was a \u2018he.\u2019 And comes back a \u2018she.\u2019 And they do this\u2026And often without parental consent.\u201dThere is no evidence that US schools have sent children into gender-affirming surgeries without their parents knowing or performed gender-affirming surgeries on site; Trump\u2019s own presidential campaign could not provide a single example of any of this ever happening. Even in states wheregender-affirming surgeryis legal for people under age 18, parental consent\u00a0is required before a minor can undergo such a procedure.Trump\u2019s opponents and the election: In Reading, Trump falselyclaimedof his election opponents: \u201cThey are cheatin\u2019 dogs, I will tell you that.\u201d In Scranton, he falselyclaimed, \u201cTheir first meeting is: \u2018How do we cheat?\u2019\u201d This is all nonsense. There is no basis for the claim that Trump\u2019s opponents are election cheaters.Harris\u2019 previous presidential campaign: Trump repeated his falseclaimthat, when Harris ran for president in 2020, \u201cshe was the first one to drop out, of like 22 people\u201d in the Democratic primary. In fact, 13 other Democratic candidates dropped out of that primary before Harris exited in December 2019 \u2013 including\u00a0the\u00a0sitting\u00a0or former governors ofWashington,MontanaandColorado; the\u00a0sittingmayor of New York City;andsittingorformermembers of the House of Representatives andSenate.Harris and the press:Trump falselyclaimedof Harris: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t do any interviews.\u201d Trump is entitled to argue that Harris has not done a sufficient number of interviews as the Democratic presidential nominee, but the assertion she doesn\u2019t do \u201cany\u201d iswrong; Harris has done multiple interviews in recent weeks. Notably, Harris did an interview with the CBS News show \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which aired Monday, whileTrump backed outof his own interview with the show.Harris-Walz and the Supreme Court: After correctly noting that Harris\u2019 running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, recentlyexpressed supportfor getting rid of the Electoral College, Trump falselyclaimed, \u201cThey want to add\u2026 they\u2019re thinking about \u2013 first time I heard this number \u2013 25: they want to have 25 Supreme Court justices.\u201d There is no basis for the claim that Harris or Walz is pushing for a 25-justice Supreme Court.Walz and menstrual products in schools: TrumpdisparagedWalz as \u201cTampon Tim,\u201d then said, \u201cYou know why they call him that? \u2019Cause they sell tampons, with special legislation, in boys\u2019 locker rooms.\u201d Trump\u2019s claim is false. The law Walz signed in 2023 requires schools to provide free menstrual products in bathrooms, not the sale of menstrual products in locker rooms \u2013 and all 18 public school districts that responded to CNN\u2019s questions about the law say they do not provide the products in boys\u2019 bathrooms.

The Biden administration has made a push to get automakers to reduce emissions and adopt electric vehicles, but there is not a mandate for consumers; thetailpipe rulesfor automakers that were unveiled by the administration earlier this year aim to have electric vehicles make up 35% to 56% new vehicles sold in 2032.The Paris climate accord and emissions: Trumprepeatedhis false claim that under the Paris climate accord, the US \u201chad to pay a trillion dollars\u201d while some other countries didn\u2019t have to pay.Trump\u2019s \u201ctrillion\u201d figure is a wild exaggeration.Under the Obama administration,the US paid$1 billion of a $3 billion commitment it originally made in 2014. After Trump pulled the country out of the Paris accord, the US paid nothing to theglobal finance goal. And while Bidenpledged $11.4 billion annuallyfrom the US, this level of funding hasn\u2019t materialized. That\u2019s because Congress, responsible for appropriating the nation\u2019s budget, has allocated onlya fraction of that\u2013 roughly $1 billion in 2022.Harris\u2019 comments on fracking: Trump said, \u201cListen to Kamala in her own words very recently,\u201d then played two video clips in which Harris said she was in favor of banning fracking. But those clipsare from 2019, beyond any reasonable definition of \u201cvery recently.\u201d Harris hassaidduring the 2024 campaign that she no longer favors banning fracking.Venezuela, prisons and migration: Trump falselyclaimed, \u201cIn Venezuela, many countries, they\u2019re emptying their prisons into our country.\u201d This is false. Trump has never corroborated this claim about Venezuela, let alone \u201cmany countries,\u201d and experts have told CNN,PolitiFactandFactCheck.orgthat they know of no evidence for it.\u201cWe have no evidence that the Venezuelan government is emptying its prisons or mental health institutions to send them outside the country, in other words, to the U.S. or any other country,\u201d Roberto Brice\u00f1o-Le\u00f3n, founder and director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, an independent organization that tracks violence in the country, said in an email to CNN in June, after Trump made similar claims.Venezuela, criminals and migration: Adding another colorful story about Venezuela, Trump falselyclaimedthat \u201cthey take the criminal gangs from Caracas off the streets and they bus them into the United States and drop them.\u201d This is false. There is no evidence of Venezuelan authorities somehow busing gang members into the US.The world prison population: Trumprepeatedhis false claim that \u201cthe prison population all over the world is down, because they put them in our country.\u201d The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from at least about10.77 million peopleto at least about10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom.\u201cI do a daily news search to see what\u2019s going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,\u201dHelen Fair, co-author of the prison population list and research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London, said in June, when Trump made a similar claim.The number of migrants: Trump, speaking about migration, falselyclaimedthat \u201c21 million people \u2013 plus \u2013 came into our nation\u201d under the Biden-Harris administration.Through August, the country hadrecordedabout 10.3 million nationwide \u201cencounters\u201d with migrants during the Biden-Harris administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country; even adding in so-called \u201cgotaways\u201d who evaded detection,estimatedby House Republicans as being roughly 2 million, there\u2019s no way the total is \u201c21 million.\u201dHarris, migrants and criminals: Trump, criticizing Harris on immigration, againwrongly describeda set of statistics that was released in September.

CNN affiliate KDKA in Pittsburghreportedthat the Secret Service put the crowd at 24,000 people, while the Trump-supporting sheriff of Blair County, Pennsylvania, James Ott,saidin his speech at the rally itself (more than three hours before Trump took the stage) that he was looking out at \u201c21,000-plus people.\u201dTrump\u2019s response to the assassination attempt: Trump, speaking of his response to the attempted assassination in July, falselyclaimed, \u201cI said as I was getting up \u2013 before\u00a0I even got up \u2013 I said, \u2018How many people were killed?\u2019 Because, you know, it was wall to wall people, and\u00a0I said, \u2018How many people were killed?\u2019 They said, \u2018We\u00a0think three, sir,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s not good.\u2019\u201dTrump\u2019s rally microphonepicked up what was saidby Trump and Secret Service agents while he was on the ground and just after, and he did not ask, before or after he got up, how many people were killed. It\u2019s possible he did so after he was whisked off stage (and, of course, possible he was genuinely misremembering what happened in such a traumatic moment).Trump and firefighters: Trump falselyclaimed, \u201cWe got the firefighters endorse us, you probably heard.\u201d But the actual recentnational newswas that the International Association of Firefighters had decided not to endorse any candidate in the race; while Trump is free to argue that this was a victory for him, given that the union endorsed Biden in 2020, it was not an actual endorsement. And while there were some people in the Scranton crowd holding \u201cScranton Firefighters for Trump\u201d signs, the Scranton chapter of the union also has not issued an endorsement.

It did publish a post-electionletter, from then-executive editor Dean Baquet and publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., that said the election had raised several questions, including this: \u201cDid Donald Trump\u2019s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?\u201d But the letter did not include an apology, to Trump or anyone else.Trump and the defeat of ISIS: Trump repeated his falseclaimthat \u201cwe defeated ISIS in four weeks; it was supposed to take four or five years.\u201d The ISIS \u201ccaliphate\u201d was declared fully liberatedmore than two yearsinto Trump\u2019s presidency.Military equipment surrendered to the Taliban: Trumprepeatedhis false claim that \u201cwe gave $85 billion worth\u201d of US military equipment to the Taliban. Trump\u2019s figure is a massive exaggeration; the Pentagon hasestimatedthat the equipment abandoned to the Taliban by Afghan forces upon their 2021 collapse was worth about $7.1 billion \u2013 a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021.Biden and foreign income: Trump repeated his falseclaimthat \u201cBiden got a lot of money from China.\u201d After years ofinvestigationby House Republicans, there is still no evidence Biden has received any Chinese money.Chris Wallace and a question about the Biden family: Trumptoldhisfamiliarfalse story about how he had asked Biden at a 2020 presidential debate why the wife of a mayor of Moscow had paid Biden $3.5 million \u2013 in fact, the money was sent to a firm connected to the president\u2019s son Hunter Biden, not to the president \u2013 but moderator Chris Wallace, then of Fox News and now of CNN, had interjected to say, \u201cWell, please don\u2019t ask him that question.\u201d Wallace never did that. As the transcriptshows, Wallace interjected during this debate exchange to try to get Trump to\u00a0allow\u00a0Biden to answer Trump\u2019s question about the payment, not to stop Trump from asking.Inflation: Trump repeated his falseclaimthat inflation under Biden and Harris is \u201cthe worst inflation in the history of our country.\u201d Trump could fairly say that the USinflation ratehit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the all-timerecordof23.7%, set in 1920, and the rate has since plummeted; the most recent available inflation rate at the time Trump spoke here was2.5%in August.Mortgage rates: Trump falselyclaimedthat young people can\u2019t buy a house because interest rates are higher than 10%: \u201cIt\u2019s not 10%, it\u2019s 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 percent.\u201d This is false. The average rate on a standard 30-year fixed mortgagewas 6.12%in the week ending October 3, according to mortgage financing provider Freddie Mac, and6.32%in the week ending October 10.Trump\u2019s tax cut: Trump repeated his falseclaimthat \u201cI gave you, as you know, the largest tax cut in the history of our country.\u201d Expert analyses havefoundthat his 2017 tax cut law was not the largest in US history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or in inflation-adjusted dollars.Tariffs on China: Trump repeated two of his regular false claims about tariffs on imported Chinese products. He falselyclaimedthat China \u201cpaid hundreds of billions of dollars\u201d in these tariffs during his presidency, then falselyclaimedthat before his presidency, \u201cnobody ever brought in 10 cents, not one other \u2013 not 10 cents, you check those records.\u201dWe\u2019ve checked, and the truth is that the US wasgenerating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on China before Trump took office; in fact, the US has had tariffs on Chinese imports since the 1700s. Second, US importers pay these tariffs, not China, andstudy after studyhas found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump\u2019s tariffs.The 1890s and tariffs: Touting the supposed benefits of tariffs, Trump falselyclaimedthat in the 1890s, when the UShad very high tariffs, \u201cOur country was the richest it ever was.\u201d The US is far richer today than in the 1890s; per capita gross domestic product isnow many times higherthan it was then.The trade deficit with China: Trumprepeatedhisfrequent false claimthat the US trade deficit with China has averaged \u201c$500 billion\u201d per year. The US hasnever\u00a0had a $500 billiontrade deficit with China even if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade in which the US traditionally runs a surplus with China; the all-time record, about $418 billion, was set under Trump in 2018.Harris and taxes: Trumpplayeda deceptively editedvideoshowing \u201cThe View\u201d co-host Meghan McCain saying to Harris in 2019, \u201cEverything from a 70 to 80% tax rate,\u201d and Harris responding, \u201cI think that\u2019s fantastic.\u201dThis video cuts out key words from theexchange; Harris was not specifically endorsing high tax rates when she made the \u201cfantastic\u201d comment.Here\u2019s the transcript of the 2019 exchange:McCain: \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the party. She officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi. She wason \u201860 Minutes\u2019 this weekendproudly calling herself a radical. And she\u2019s promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car, should be eliminated within the next 11 years, everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. Do you agree that she could possibly \u2013 and this ideology, of the socialist left \u2013 could splinter your party?\u201dHarris: \u201cNo. You know, I think that she is challenging the status quo. I think that\u2019s fantastic. I think that \u2013 you know, I used to teach, before, especially before \u2013 in the last few years \u2013 and the thing that I always loved about teaching was when you teach, it requires you to defend the premise. And it requires you to re-examine the premise. And question, is it still relevant? Is it \u2013 does it have impact? Does it have meaning? And I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. And I think it\u2019s good for the party, I frankly think it\u2019s good for the country. Let\u2019s look at the bold ideas. And I\u2019m eager that we have those discussions. And when we are able to defend status quo, then do it, and if there are \u2013 you know, if there\u2019s not merit to that, then let\u2019s explore new ideas.\u201dBiden\u2019s documents case: Trump falselyclaimedin Reading that, in an investigation into Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents, \u201cBiden was essentially convicted\u201d and in Scrantonthat\u201cthey ruled on him, they said he\u2019s guilty.\u201d Biden was not convicted, \u201cessentially\u201d or not, and was not found guilty; in fact, Biden was not even charged with a crime. The special counsel in the case, Robert Hur,wrotein his public report that \u201cthe evidence does not establish Mr. Biden\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d adding that \u201cseveral defenses are likely to create reasonable doubt as to such charges.\u201dA supposed Biden gaffe: Mocking Biden\u2019s gaffes, Trump falselyclaimed, \u201cBut the worst was when he was in New Hampshire and he said, \u2018It\u2019s great to be in Florida.\u2019 That\u2019s palm trees.\u201d This never happened.

While Musk has recently favored closer ties, Ramaswamy has called for an economic decoupling from China.As a presidential candidate in the 2024 GOP primary, Ramaswamy was often critical of US economic ties to China. While he claimed other companies such as Apple and Black Rock were enabling and making political concessions to China, he often singled out Musk for some of his harshest criticism.\u201a\u00c4\u00faElon Musk has, I think, demonstrated his willingness to change his political tunes based on the favors that he gets to be able to do business in China,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ramaswamy added on the 2022 Fox News podcast.Examining potential for DOGE partnershipCNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s KFile reviewed Ramaswamy\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments on Musk when looking into how the two might operate DOGE, the nongovernmental entity.

Hegseth strongly deniesher allegations.President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth speaks to reporters as he leaves the Russell Senate Office Building on November 21, 2024 in Washington, DC.Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesRelated articleThe New Yorker: Pete Hegseth forced out of veterans\u2019 advocacy groups over misconduct allegationsA New Yorker articlepublished Sundayalleged Hegsethwas pushed out as the head of two veterans\u2019 advocacy organizations amid internal allegations of financial mismanagement and personal misconduct.Hegseth\u2019s lack of experience has also raised concerns about his ability to manage a large organization like the Pentagon with its nearly $1 trillion annual budget.But his views on certain aspects of military policy, albeit expressed from the confines of his job as a cable news co-host, strike some experts as outside the mainstream, not in keeping with classic military doctrine, and all but impossible to implement.\u201cIf he came into the secretary of defense job trying to institute all these policies, boom, boom, boom, the place would stop functioning and he would find himself an irrelevant secretary of defense,\u201d said retired Army Maj. Gen. James \u201cSpider\u201d Marks, a CNN military analyst.In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for the Trump-Vance transition touted Hegseth\u2019s record of military service and defended his past comments as a Fox News host.\u201cPete has shared points of view in the past as a private citizen and media personality, but as nominee for Secretary of Defense, he\u2019s committed to upholding the Constitution and President Trump\u2019s Make America Strong Again agenda,\u201d the statement read.An early Trump criticA Princeton and Harvard graduate, Hegseth, 44, joined the Army National Guard in 2002 and served for nearly 20 years before retiring as a major. He deployed to Guantanamo Bay, where he served as an infantry platoon leader, and later served combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was awarded two Bronze Stars, among other awards, for his service.He frequently appeared on Fox News while working at veterans-related nonprofits and later became the weekend co-host of \u201cFox & Friends\u201d in 2017.During the 2016 presidential election, Hegseth initially supported Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. He harshly criticized Trump\u2019s grasp of national security issues and forsayingthat he got his military advice from people like himself on Fox News.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want a top-tier presidential candidate getting all of their military advice from watching \u2018Meet the Press.\u2019 There\u2019s a lot more nuance. There\u2019s a lot more detail,\u201d Hegseth said in August 2015.\u201cForeign policy, national security is not about TV shows. [The campaign is] going to have to walk back a little bit from this idea that he gets it from the political shows.\u201dBefore Trump secured the 2016 Republican nomination, Hegseth also attacked him for his five draft deferments during the Vietnam War, calling him an \u201carmchair tough guy.\u201d\u201c[Trump is] all bluster, very little substance. He talks a tough game. But then when pressed he\u2019s an armchair tough guy,\u201d Hegseth said on Fox Newsin March 2016, notingthat Trump sought his \u201cown five military deferments.\u201dIn this December 2016 photo, Fox News contributor Pete Hegseth arrives at Trump Tower in New York City.Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesInOctober 2015, Hegseth further attacked Trump for flip-flopping his position on the war in Afghanistan \u2013 first saying he never supported the war and calling it a mistake before reversing that position \u2013 and condemned Trump\u2019s stance on the Iraq War and the veterans who fought in it.Hegseth on numerous occasions was critical of Trump\u2019s stances on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which the president-elect has shifted multiple times over the years. However, Hegseth has since embraced Trump\u2019s skepticism of those two wars and his \u201cAmerica First\u201d ethos.\u201cIf you step back for a moment and look at what was our return on investment, you start to realize, I can eat \u2013 I need to eat some humble pie. Put America first and realize that our orientation in the Middle East is ultimately not making us safer right now,\u201d Hegseth said in September 2020.War criminals and waterboardingIn 2019,CNN reportedthat Hegseth was privately courting Trump to pardon some servicemen accused and convicted of war crimes. Against theadvice of his Pentagon officials, who worried the pardons would undermine the military justice system, Trump pardoned two service members and restored the rank of a Navy SEAL who had been demoted.Hegseth reiterated his support for not criminalizing soldiers on a podcastin June 2024.\u201cDonald Trump pardoned a bunch of guys I advocated for in his last couple years in office. They killed the right guys in the wrong way, according to somebody. I\u2019m done with that,\u201d Hegseth said. \u201cWe need to fight total war against our enemies when we do. And yeah, you don\u2019t kill civilians on purpose, but you kill bad guys. All of \u2019em, you stack bodies, and when it\u2019s over, then you let the dust settle and you figure out who\u2019s ahead.\u201dHegseth also pushed Trump to take further action against Iran after the presidentordered a drone strikein January 2020 that killed Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani.In a Fox News segment, Hegseth suggested Trump should take further action by targeting cultural sites that may harbor dangerous weapons \u2013 a violation of both international law and theDepartment of Defense\u2019s policy.\u201cIf we want to defeat them, we have to think smart about how we navigate within these rules, without playing a game rigged to help them,\u201dhe said in January 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hit cultural sites on purpose. If you are using one to harbor your most dangerous weapons, that should be on the list.\u201dLikeTrump, Hegseth has also praised waterboarding as an \u201ceffective\u201d tactic. He said it was \u201cabsolutely a mistake\u201d to take waterboarding off the table in 2016 and said the president had the power to bring it back.\u201cIf it\u2019s gonna keep us safe, all it would take is an executive order by the next president to change that law,\u201d Hegsethsaidin 2016.Congress codifieda ban on waterboarding in 2015.CNN\u2019s Winter Hawk and Ileya Robinson-Williams contributed to this report."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump\u2019s extreme dislike of FBI directors, explained", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/23/politics/donald-trump-fbi-what-matters/index.html", "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s What Matters newsletter.

That said, Trump has never shied away from firing someone he once backed.FBI directors get those 10-year terms as the result of a post-Watergate law that was in response to J. Edgar Hoover\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s much-too-long and controlling 48-year leadership of the FBI.The term length is supposed to inoculate the director from political pressure. But it never works out that way.If Trump fires Wray, he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d be first president to fire 2 FBI directorsTrump famouslyfired then-FBI Director James Comeymonths after taking office for his first term in 2017. Comey was also a Republican, although he was nominated to the position by Democratic President Barack Obama. (Comeylater said in 2018that he \u201a\u00c4\u00facan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be associated with\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the Republican Party due to Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s influence on the GOP.)Presidents before Trump pushed FBI directors outIn 1993, Bill Clintonfired then-FBI Director William Sessionsafter an internal ethics report emerged during the prior year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presidential campaign. It included questions about a $10,000 fence installed around the director\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s home and flights he had taken, among other issues.Earlier, Jimmy Carter suggested during the 1976 presidential campaign that he would have firedthen-FBI Director Clarence Kelleyover revelations about window drapery valances improperly installed at his home, among other things. Carter did not immediately fire Kelley when he took the White House, but Kelley was ultimately forced to resign, according to Douglas Charles, a history professor at Penn State University, who noted that the drapery scandal \u201a\u00c4\u00fatoday seems like very small fry stuff.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9But at the time, it would have tested the new law, which Congress passed in 1976, for Carter to fire Kelley.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere certainly was the question, can any president fire an FBI director when there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a legislated 10-year term,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Charles said.While that question has clearly been answered now, those previous firings were about ethics and personal failings. Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s are about policy differences, including over the role of the Justice Department overall.Why did Trump fire Comey?The stated reasons for Comey\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s firing,laid out in a memoprepared for Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Justice Department, were contradictory. Comey was criticized both for not prosecuting Hillary Clinton over her treatment of classified material and then for releasing \u201a\u00c4\u00faderogatory\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 information about Clinton at a press conference.The real reason Comey was fired,as Trump admittedto NBC News at the time, was Comey\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s investigation into ties between Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2016 campaign and Russia.Former FBI director James Comey takes his seat at the beginning of the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in Washington, DC, on June 8, 2017.Andrew Harnik/APThen Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s troubles cascadedIn the furor that followed Comey\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s firing, it was the author of the Justice Department memo recommending Comey\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s firing, then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, whoappointed a special counselto follow up on the Russia investigation.Rosenstein appointed the special counsel because Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, hadrecused himselffrom any investigation related to Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2016 campaign. Sessions did so because he had failed during Senate confirmation hearings to disclose preelection contacts he had with Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ambassador to the US at the time.Enter another former FBI directorWho did Rosenstein pick as special counsel to lead that Russia investigation? Robert S. Mueller III, who happened to be the former FBI director. Mueller was widely respected and had taken charge of the FBIdays beforethe 9/11 attacks in 2001. Congress passed aspecial lawto extend his term by two years during the Obama administration.Anyone who remembers Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first term can recall that speculation about the Russia investigation sucked up much of the oxygen in Washington and led to the prosecution of several of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s top 2016 campaign aides, including campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who Trump later pardoned. Trump has complained that the investigation was part of a \u201a\u00c4\u00fadeep state\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 effort to undermine him.Unintended consequencesThecooperationby Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s former fixer Michael Cohen with Mueller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s investigation is what led to revelations about hush money payments for which Trump was convicted in New York earlier this year. Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sentencing for his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records has beendelayed indefinitelyafter his election win.What the Mueller report concludedThe release of Mueller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s report wasslow-walkedby Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second attorney general, Bill Barr, who gave the impression that Mueller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s report exonerated Trump. It did not.Mueller was constrained by Justice Department rules that bar the prosecution of a sitting president. When the full report was released in April 2019, Mueller said there was not enough evidence to prove collusion between Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign and Russians. It also specifically did not exonerate Trump.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhile this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9the report said. It also concluded that while Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign in 2016 expected help from Russia, it didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t conspire with Russia. That gets forgotten after years of Trump referring to Mueller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s investigation as the \u201a\u00c4\u00faRussia hoax.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9There are things that helped generate the Mueller investigation, notably thediscredited Steele dossier, that will forever anger Trump.Then-special counsel Robert Mueller makes a statement about the Russia investigation on May 29, 2019, at the Justice Department in Washington, DC.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesTrump targeted FBI officialsThere were also related scandals, such as the release of anti-Trump texts by an FBI agent at the time, Peter Strzok, who initially played a role in Mueller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s inquiry, and Lisa Page, who was then an FBI attorney with whom Strzok was having an affair. TheFBI agreedin July of this year to pay $2 million to Strzok and Page to compensate for the release of those text messages.Another FBI official, Andrew McCabe, who served briefly as acting director after Trump fired Comey, was fired by Sessions days before his retirement. McCabe, now a CNN contributor, ultimatelywon back his pension in court.Trump turned on WrayWray wasoverwhelmingly confirmedto succeed Comey in August 2017 in part by promising during confirmation hearings to maintain independence from the White House. Trump, meanwhile, prizes loyalty.Even while Trump was still presidentin 2020, he had already turned on Wray, in part because he felt Wray was not cooperating with special counsel John Durham \u201a\u00c4\u00ec who was appointed by Barr, Sessions\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 replacement, to investigate the Mueller investigation.In this 2017 photo, then-President Donald Trump sits with FBI Director Christopher Wray in Quantico, Virginia.Evan Vucci/AP/FileAll of that adds up to why Trump wants loyalists at the Department of Justice, including the FBI.Douglas said that about 100 years ago, in the wake of the Teapot Dome scandal that exposed corruption within the federal government, there was talk in the Senate of taking the Department of Justice, including the FBI, completely out of politics and making it and all of its employees an independent part of the civil service.Trump wants to go in the opposite direction today and bring the FBI more under the control of the president."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "The common national experience that explains Trump\u2019s 2024 gains", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/trump-wide-gains-2024-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014The most impressive aspect ofDonald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris last week was the uniformity of his gains across the electoral landscape.But paradoxically, the very magnitude of his gains may offer Democrats their best hope of recovery in the next few elections. The across-the-board nature of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s improvement suggests that his victory wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t primarily driven by the two campaigns\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 tactical choices, messaging decisions or advertising strategies.Trump gained ground in urban, suburban and rural counties and improved on his vote share, as of the latest counts, in 49 of the 50 states.A preliminary CNN analysisconcluded that Trump ran better than he did in 2020 in fully 9 in 10 of the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s counties where results are available.Those sweeping gains document how much ground Democrats lost this year \u201a\u00c4\u00ee not only in places where they were bracing for further retreat (including both in rural communities and urban centers) but also the racially diverse, well-educated suburbs that had earlier keyed the resistance to Trump. Those losses leave Democrats in a weaker electoral position, in most respects, at the start of the second Trump presidency than at the outset of his first.But the scale of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s advance this year points toward a common national experience in all regions of the country \u201a\u00c4\u00ee a shared disappointment in the results generated by PresidentJoe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s administration, primarily on inflation, but secondarily around other issues led by immigration and crime. The evidence that the outcome was driven largely by a negative verdict on Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s performance underscores the possibility that Democrats could recover sooner than now seems possible if Americans one day conclude that Trump hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t delivered the better results he has promised.A flag is left at an event held by Vice President Kamala Harris at Howard University in Washington, DC, on November 6, 2024.Daniel Cole/ReutersRelated articleStill-stunned Democrats begin to squint toward their futureThe consistency of the Democratic decline this year \u201a\u00c4\u00fareflects a very broad sense of discontent across many different demographic groups, across every major population group, with the direction of the country under Biden,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz. Trump and the GOP, he said, face the same risk of reversal if the president-elect pursues some of the policies that voters remained uneasy about even as they voted for him \u201a\u00c4\u00ee especially if he can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t ease the cost-of-living squeeze that drove much of this year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s result.Experts agree that factors beyond disappointment in the Biden administration\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s outcomes also influenced the results. These ranged from a widening cultural gap between Democrats and Latinos, especially men, to continuing resistance among some voters to entrusting the presidency to a woman, to the GOP\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s successful efforts to portray Harris as an extremist cultural liberal largely through attacks on views about transgender issues she expressed during her 2020 presidential campaign.But more targeted dynamics can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t explain a shift as comprehensive as the one the country experienced last week. Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 loss, as a quasi-incumbent, followed a well-established pattern: When an outgoing president faces widespread discontent over his performance, his party has almost always failed to hold the White House in the election to succeed him. (That dynamic applied when Democrats Harry Truman in 1952 and Lyndon Johnson in 1968 stepped down rather than seek reelection, and again in 2008 with Republican George W. Bush leaving office after his two terms.)\u201a\u00c4\u00faPeople struggle to find explanations for what is going on with Hispanic men, or with young people, but the most common explanation [to all of them] is the right one,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck, the co-author of well-respected books on the 2016 and 2020 elections. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNobody thinks things are going well, and if you are the incumbent you own that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Two sophisticated new geographic analyses of the results underscore just how powerful and pervasive the movement toward Trump was this year. One comes fromthe Daily Yonder websitepublished by the nonpartisan Center for Rural Studies.The center has developed a system that categorizes the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s roughly 3,100 counties into six categories from the most urban (major metro core counties) to the most rural (nonmetropolitan counties). In between, the center divides counties into the categories of suburbs of those major cities; medium-sized cities; the suburbs of those medium-sized cities; small communities; and the rural, nonmetropolitan counties.President Donald Trump arrives to speak during an election night event at the Palm Beach Convention Center on November 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Florida.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesANALYSISTrump is already wielding power and causing massive disruptionAccording to the preliminary analysis of the election results the group provided to me, Trump gained in all six kinds of counties \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and by strikingly similar amounts. Trump improved his vote by 4 percentage points in each of the two most populous categories \u201a\u00c4\u00eethe major metro core counties and their suburbs \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and by 3 percentage points in each of the other four groupings of smaller places.This was a more consistent rise than the center has recorded across the spectrum of urban-rural counties in any recent election. From 2004 to 2008, Barack Obama improved on John Kerry\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s performance in all six kinds of counties, but Obama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gains varied more \u201a\u00c4\u00ee from about 3 points in the smallest places to roughly double that in the largest. From 2008 to 2012, Obama improved slightly in the three groupings of largest places but lost ground in the three smaller categories. In 2016, Hillary Clinton ran better than Obama in the largest places, but Trump ran far better than Mitt Romney, the GOP\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2012 nominee, in the smaller ones.Tellingly, the closest recent comparison to Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s uniform gains this year was Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4sperformance four years ago. Biden improved on Clinton\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s share of the vote by between 1.5 to 2 percentage points in all of the center\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s categories of midsized counties, and by 0.5 points in the two poles of their scale: the very largest urban centers and the smallest rural places.Biden in 2020did not gain ground across the countryin as large a percentage of counties as Trump did in 2024. But, as the center\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s data showed, Biden then, like Trump now, improved quite consistently across the map, from the most urban to the most rural places.Abramowitz says the state-level results send a similar message about how much Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s electoral recovery this year resembles his decline four years earlier. In 2020, five states flipped from Trump to Biden; in 2024, they all flipped back to Trump (as did Nevada, which narrowly backed Biden four years ago). In 2020, Biden won Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,the three former \u201a\u00c4\u00fablue wall\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 statesthat decided the election, by a combined 257,029 votes. As of last weekend, Trump led in those three states, all of which he won, by a combined margin of 256,940 votes.In all, Biden in 2020, according to the CNN analysis, improved over Clinton\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s showing four years before in 42 states. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not as many as moved toward Trump this year; but both elections, Abramowitz noted, look quite different from the much more mixed results of 2016, when Trump improved on the GOP\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2012 performance in 38 states but lost ground in 13 others.Vavreck said Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first election in 2016 produced a lasting ideological and demographic \u201a\u00c4\u00fareshuffling\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that moved states with large populations of non-college White voters (such as Iowa and Ohio) toward the GOP while cementing the Democratic advantage in diverse and well-educated states that became light blue during the Obama years (Colorado and Virginia).But since then, she said, the similarly uniform shift away from Trump in 2020 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and then back toward him in 2024 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee points toward voter assessments of performance, rather than big further ideological shifts, as the main driver of the results. Just as Trump, as the incumbent, suffered from a negative verdict on his performance in 2020, Harris, as the quasi-incumbent successor to Biden, suffered from a negative verdict on the president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s performance four years later.Former President Donald Trump holds a news conference from inside trash hauler at the airport in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on October 30, 2024.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesRelated articleWe asked Americans what they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d heard about Trump and Harris throughout the campaign. Here\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what they told us\u201a\u00c4\u00faA lot of that is kind of pure retrospective voting: Things are not going well, so kick the incumbent out,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Vavreck said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn 2020, Biden picks up everywhere. Now we look from \u201a\u00c4\u00f420 to \u201a\u00c4\u00f424 and the Democrats are losing [ground] everywhere.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9A second new geographic analysis of the 2024 election results also underscores the comprehensive nature of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gains. The center-left Brookings Metro think tank for several years has correlated the election results with federal data that records how much each county contributes to the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s total economic output.Those analyses consistently have foundthat Democrats now dominate the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highest-output counties, which tend to be large metro areas that have transitioned the fastest into the 21st century information-age economy. Republicans, meanwhile, run best in places generally on the outskirts of the major metro areas that are more dependent on the powerhouse industries of the 20th century: agriculture, energy extraction and manufacturing.The group\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s new analysisshows those divisions largely holding this year.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe first thing to say is that the country remains extremely divided economically,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro who directs this research. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t changed.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9But the results this year also show Trump establishing what Muro called a \u201a\u00c4\u00fatoehold\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most productive metro areas, particularly across the Sun Belt. In 2020, Trump won just five of the 100 counties that contributed the most to the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s overall economic output, while Biden carried an astounding 95. This year, Trump has already won 17 of the 100 most productive counties and Harris 78 (with five still to be called).Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gains in those very high-output counties, as well as his success in flipping at least another roughly 70 counties from blue to red, has dramatically increased the share of national economic output contributed by the places that support him. In 2020, Biden won only a little more than one-sixth of the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s counties, but the places he captured generated over 70% of the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s total economic output. This year, Trump has already won counties that account for 40% of the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s economic output (with 161 counties still to be called at the time Brookings conducted this analysis late last week).The highest-output counties Trump flipped were almost entirely in the Sun Belt: from Hillsborough (Tampa) and Tarrant (Fort Worth) to Maricopa (Phoenix).Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recapture of Maricopa was especially dramatic, after Biden in 2020 became the first Democratic presidential nominee to carry the county since Truman in 1948.Muro says Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gains in high-output metros across the Sun Belt, like his support fromElon Muskand other conservative Silicon Valley leaders, show Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s potential to establish a beachhead in new-economy bastions that almost all viewed him with suspicion during his first term. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is the sort of the leading edge of the Trump governing base that now has picked up a number of significant economic centers in addition to its literally thousands of small-town and rural places,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Muro said.The question, Muro said, is whether Trump can preserve that beachhead while pursuing policies he pledged,such as the mass deportationof undocumented immigrants, sweeping tariffs, rescinding theBiden-passed incentives for clean energyand possibly also semiconductor manufacturing, and potentially moving to restrict civil rights and liberties. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Trump agenda,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Muro said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fadoes not seem like one conducive to maximizing the output of the country and particularly the dense blue metros.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Donald Trump talks to reporters at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters headquarters in Washington, DC, on January 31, 2024.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesRelated articleWhy Trump surged in New York, but House Democrats succeeded in the stateMuro\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s question about the high-output metros applies more broadly: While disappointment with Biden provided a huge lift for Republicans last week, moving forward Trump will need to sustain support on the strength of his own agenda, leadership style and results.The exit pollsconducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN,as well as the VoteCast studydone by NORC in partnership with the Associated Press and other media organizations, made clear that even as voters returned Trump to the Oval Office, many of them retained doubts about his agenda and personal style. Across the two studies, a majority of voters described Trump as \u201a\u00c4\u00fatoo extreme\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and likely to steer the US toward authoritarianism, while majorities also expressed opposition to his mass deportation plan; majorities also indicated support for legal abortion and a greater government role in ensuring health care coverage for Americans.The surveys made clear that those concerns were submerged by the towering discontent with the results of the Biden presidency. In the exit polls, about three-fifths of voters said they disapproved of Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s performance, and two-thirds described the economy in negative terms. About 80% of the voters who disapproved of Biden voted for Trump, as did about 70% of those who expressed negative views about the economy, the exit polls found.As a result of those cross-cutting pressures, a critical share of voters who expressed concerns about Trump or his agenda in the two surveys voted for him anyway: For instance, one-fourth of women who described themselves as supporting legal abortion in the exit polls still voted for Trump. So did about one-fourth of Latinos who said in the exit polls they opposed mass deportation. About 1 in 8 voters who described Trump as too extreme, or said he would lead the US toward authoritarianism, likewise backed him anyway.Vavreck said it should be surprising that even many voters resistant to elements of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s agenda prioritized more immediate concerns \u201a\u00c4\u00ee particularly their frustration over the cost of living, as well as issues such as the border and crime. Those frustrations created an almost insuperable barrier for Harris.But in a little over two months, Trump, once again, will be the incumbent. And in Vavreck\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s phrase,heand his party will own the results of the coming years. If Americans feel he has made progress on the problems they elected him to solve, he will likely maintain a strong position. But if they feel he has not, or if they conclude he has created new problems with his policies, there could be a turn away from Trump and the GOP in the 2026 and 2028 elections that is just as uniform as the movement toward them last week."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump cites Hunter Biden pardon in latest legal attempt to throw out hush money conviction", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/politics/trump-hush-money-hunter-biden-pardon/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Defense lawyers for President-elect Donald Trump are usingPresident Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pardon of his son Hunterto argue that Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conviction in his Manhattan hush money case should be dismissed.\u201a\u00c4\u00faYesterday in issuing a 10 year pardon to Hunter Biden that covers any and all crimes whether charged or uncharged, President Biden asserted that his son was \u201a\u00c4\u00f2selectively, and unfairly prosecuted\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and \u201a\u00c4\u00f2treated differently,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Trump lawyers wrote in a motion filed Monday.FILE PHOTO: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump attends a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket, in Brownsville, Texas, U.S., November 19, 2024 .

And Democrats may need to win over some of those very same voters to find their way out of the political wilderness.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe mood is slightly different than the last time and there is a sense that if you are freaking out about everything, it becomes really hard for people to sort out what is worth worrying about,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, told CNN.Now, Democrats are looking to implement a deliberate and disciplined strategy in Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second term: pointing out the places where they could work with a nominee when they see fit and forcing Republicans to defend Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s picks when a nominee faces ethics questions, has a history of controversial statements or doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have what Democrats view as the necessary qualifications for the job.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have to acknowledge something even if we are disappointed that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s true: Trump won. He is the president. We have to accept that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sen. Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are going to approach this in a very straightforward way.

But several Democrats CNN spoke to said they are also reticent to needlessly delay confirmations or \u201a\u00c4\u00faplay games,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 knowing that doing so could risk a GOP backlash and could embolden Trump to use what are known as recess appointments, essentially bypassing Congress altogether.Democrats stress that a measured approach shouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be mistaken for Democratic support for Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most controversial picks. In the course of conversations with more than a dozen Democrats, members and aides saidit\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s clear that some of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most contentious picks from Pete Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense to his Director of National Intelligence selection, Tulsi Gabbard, are unlikely to win over many of their members. But Democrats believe their only real strategy to move the needle on these canbdidates is to give their GOP colleagues space to make the decisions about their futures on their own and not engage in partisan battles just for the sake of the exercise.Democrats are also acutely aware that they will be in the minority and Republicans have a comfortable three-seat margin.\u201a\u00c4\u00faSometimes all you can do is create a record that shows people \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Ok, this is what you are getting,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sen.

Democrats similarly used procedural hurdles in the Senate Judiciary Committee to force Republicans to reconvene one day later to vote on Jeff Sessions to be the attorney general.At the time, Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell blasted Democrats for the moves, saying, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is time to get over the fact that they lost the election..none of this is going to lead to a different outcome.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faI can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t predict what tactics may be adopted.

Richard Blumenthal said.For committees, a key question emerges with Trump shifting normsDemocrats are also clear they won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t cease reminding voters of the ways Trump and his incoming administration are defying precedent if they decline to have nominees undergo FBI background checks. On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer penned a letter to incoming GOP leader Sen. John Thuneinsisting that Thune maintain the process of confirming nominees, including FBI background checks.Schumer wrote that the Senate should work \u201a\u00c4\u00fain a bipartisan fashion to process each nominee by reviewing standard FBI background-investigation materials, scheduling hearings and markups in the committees of jurisdiction, and considering nominees on the Senate floor.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Democrats are grappling with how much they need to do behind the scenes if Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s transition team follows through with their suggestion they won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have nominees go through the normal FBI vetting process.\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is not like we can substitute the work of the FBI,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 one Democratic source told CNN on background to discuss internal deliberations.Sen.

Democrats warn that with some of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s picks having never worked before in government, the checks are even more essential,especially as questions have been raised about the past behavior of some, including Hegseth, who was accused in 2017 of sexual assault. Police did not press charges andHegseth has denied the incident was an assault.Others suggested the question of whether Democrats engage in their own vetting is still very much up for discussion.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere have to be investigations so whether it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the FBI or our committee staff, there have to be,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kaine said while acknowledging\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt can be challenging\u201a\u00c4\u00f9especially as Democrats are seated to lose power over those committees in a matter of weeks.Democrats will remain in the majority until January, but unlike the FBI, which is well versed in conducting the nominee background checks, committees would have to stand up a plan for an investigation and execute it in short order.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe shouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t do that. We should get the FBI background check,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Welch said.In the end, Democrats say they are going to stay flexible, recognizing some of the strategy is going to be born of organic and unforeseen circumstances in the months ahead.\u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think there is an overall answer. (Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s) labor nominee is for example very different than his nominee for the Department of Defense and the approaches should be tailored to the individual nominees,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faDemocrats are here to carry out our Constitutional duties to advise and consent.

The families say the money Hungary received when it liquidated the property it stole from Jewish families was comingled with other funds and that some portion of that money was then spent in the US.Because of that, the families argue, the exception should apply.But their position drew sharp questioning from Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, two conservatives who sit at the center of the court and most often wind up with the majority when decisions are handed down.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is really just throwing out the whole sovereign immunity principles under which the rest of the world operates,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Roberts said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faCongress had in mind a much narrower exception than that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Kavanaugh said he was concerned about the foreign policy implications of a ruling for the families, worrying other nations might reciprocate and make it easier for people to sue the United States.\u201a\u00c4\u00faNo other country in the world has an expropriation exception to begin with, right?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kavanaugh pressed Dvoretzky. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a big deal to haul a foreign country into US court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Several of the court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s liberals also appeared to have reservations with the families\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 argument. Justice Sonia Sotomayor recounted a hypothetical about a parent depositing $100 to start a bank account for a newborn and then arguing that same money remained part of the account after a lifetime worth of transactions.\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s an interesting concept that that $100 that my mother put in that account the day I was born \u201a\u00c4\u00ec that a piece of it is still there 60 years, or 70 years or 80 years later,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sotomayor said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a fiction that takes quite an imagination.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Justices Elena Kagan and Samuel Alito, a liberal and conservative, respectively, worried that immunizing foreign countries that simply mix expropriated property into general funds would render the exception Congress approved useless because countries would have an easy path to avoiding scrutiny from federal courts.\u201a\u00c4\u00faDoesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t this provide a roadmap to any country that wants to expropriate property?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kagan asked the attorney representing Hungary, Joshua Glasgow. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn other words, just sell the property, put it into your national treasury \u201a\u00c4\u00ec insulate yourself from all claims for all time?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9At one point Alito appeared to brush aside Kavanaugh\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s concerns about foreign reciprocation, questioning whether Washington would really have to worry about such suits.\u201a\u00c4\u00faIs the United States going around expropriating the property of foreign nationals?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Alito asked an attorney representing the Biden administration, which has sided with the Hungary in the appeal.photo illustration by Alberto Mier/CNN/Getty ImagesRelated articleHe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the first known transgender lawyer to argue before Supreme Court.

We remember the stolen men and women and children who were brought to our shores in chains and subjected to unimaginable cruelty,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden said in remarks at the National Museum of Slavery, which is built near the chapel where enslaved individuals were forcibly baptized before being sent to America.The museum was built on the property of \u221a\u00c5lvaro de Carvalho Matoso, one of the largest slave traders on the African coast.Biden told the attendees that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proud to be the first president to visit Angola and that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fadeeply optimistic\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 about the future relationship between the nation and the US.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe story of Angola and the United States holds a lesson for the world.

We seek a better way, transparent, high standard, open access to investment that protects workers and the rule of law and the environment. It can be done and will be done,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the president said.Biden delivered his remarks even as he was grappling with an unexpected situation in South Korea, where President Yoon Suk Yeoldeclared martial lawin a surprise late-night address Tuesday. The US is closely monitoring the situation and is in touch with the South Korean government, and Biden told reporters after his remarks that he would be getting a full briefing soon.The president also reflected on a theme that he has mentioned throughout this presidency: his belief that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the United States\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 duty to both acknowledge and face its history.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhile history can be hidden, it cannot and should not be erased.

He thenpleaded guiltyin September to nine tax offenses, stemming from $1.4 million in taxes that he didn\u2019t pay whilespending lavishlyon escorts, strippers, cars and drugs.Sources familiar with Hunter Biden\u2019s legal strategy said he would not have agreed to plead guilty in September to all nine charges in the federal tax case \u2014 exposing himself to the possibility of 17 years in prison and more than $1 million in fines \u2014 without the expectation of clemency.The legal pressure on Hunter Biden mounted as his sentencing dates in December neared. People close to the president\u2019s son said they didn\u2019t want him to have to undergo sentencing.In the days before the pardon was issued, Hunter Biden\u2019s attorneys circulated a 50-page document outlining the six-year investigation of the president\u2019s son and blamingDonald Trumpand Republican allies for being the driving force behind his legal problems.President Joe Biden speaks on the South Lawn of the White House on December 1, in Washington, DC.Nathan Posner/Anadolu/Getty ImagesanalysisBiden\u2019s pardon of his son pours fuel on Trump\u2019s claims of politicized justiceThough controversial, Joe Biden\u2019s move to pardon a close family member or associate is not unheard of.

The organization was established in November 2022 as a more long-term extension of the work of 18th Airborne Corps, which deployed to Europe to reinforce NATO\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s eastern flank after Russia invaded Ukraine.In a military career that has spanned more than three decades since his graduation from West Point, Donahue has deployed 20 times, including time in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, North Africa and Eastern Europe, according to his Army biography.Mullin was one of the most vocal Republicans calling for accountability after the Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 US service members during the final days of the evacuation from Afghanistan. On the third anniversary of the bombing, Mullin said that \u201a\u00c4\u00fanot one person has been held accountable for the disaster\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and explicitly named Donahue.

A number of Democrats who were once willing to wait their turn on the leadership ladder have suddenly lost their patience. After watching President Joe Biden wait months to step aside only to hand over the White House to Trump, those Democrats are now more eager to challenge their party\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conventions \u201a\u00c4\u00ee including the sacrosanct principle of seniority in leadership.In public, Jeffries, a reserved leader who is known for being selective about when he puts his thumb on the scale, has not weighed in on whether he would back Rep. Jamie Raskin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenge to Rep. Jerry Nadler, the long-serving top Democrat on the influential House Judiciary Committee.But several Democrats at Jeffries\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 leadership table have privately been egging on Raskin, who is 16 years\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 Nadler\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s junior, as they hunt for the best attack dog in Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Washington, according to four people familiar with the discussions. Raskin, who currently holds the top Democratic spot on the House\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Oversight panel, is choosing to instead run for Judiciary because he considers it the \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe headquarters of Congressional opposition to authoritarianism.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faOur unified Caucus must strategize and organize like never before\u201a\u00c4\u00eeevery single one of us working together every single day until we win the House back in 2026 and then beyond that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Raskin wrote in a letter to fellow Democrats on Monday.From left, Reps.

If that is any indication of how he would do leading the Judiciary Committee, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be something that a lot of Democrats want to see,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Huffman, who is supporting Raskin, told CNN.Nadler \u201a\u00c4\u00ee who led both impeachments against Trump and has spent seven years as top Democrat on the panel \u201a\u00c4\u00ee has his own loyalties within the caucus. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s revered by many progressives and has already endured a number of cutthroat campaigns, including a nasty congressional primary against a fellow Democratic chairman just two years ago.Throughout the impeachment investigation, Jeffries appeared to defer to committee Democrats at every turn and only got involved when needed. Behind the scenes, Democrats were constantly deliberating when to respond to Republican claims and when doing so would only amplify the GOP efforts.By challenging Nadler, Raskin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vacancy on Oversight offers an opportunity for a deep bench to throw their hats in the ring. Democratic Reps. Stephen Lynch and Gerry Connolly, who have both run for the top post before, are considering trying again, sources tell CNN.But they will have to contend with younger members like Rep.

In describing the industry\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s argument, conservative Justice Clarence Thomas suggested the method the FDA used was \u201a\u00c4\u00faa moving target.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faEither they weren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t clear or you changed the guidance as time went on,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Thomas said.Curtis Gannon, a deputy solicitor general representing the FDA, disputed that framing and said the law itself was clear about what evidence the agency required.The US Supreme Court is seen on the first day of a new term in Washington, DC, on October 7, 2024.Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleIn transgender care case, Supreme Court to consider how far equal protection goesConservative Justice Samuel Alito more directly questioned the FDA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s review process, suggesting the agency told the vaping industry that they might be able to present some evidence of public health benefit to win approval but that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to tell you concretely what that something else might be.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9But Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another member of the court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conservative wing, repeatedly signaled he could support the FDA.\u201a\u00c4\u00faYou agree that, at the end of the day, the agency has to make a choice and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be a choice with uncertainty?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kavanaugh asked the lawyer arguing for the companies.The court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s three-justice liberal wing appeared to be on the side of the agency.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe know nicotine is addictive.

In 2016, the FDA decided that e-cigarettes qualified as tobacco products and it began reviewing authorization applications for millions of vaping products.The industry says that the FDA changed its method in the middle of the process, requiring companies to show that flavored products are more effective than tobacco-flavored products at helping smokers quit or cut back on cigarettes.Theconservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the industry in January, finding that officials had perpetrated a \u201a\u00c4\u00faregulatory switcheroo,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 sending manufactures on a \u201a\u00c4\u00fawild goose chase\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in to get approval.Seven other appeals courts have rejected similar challenges of the agency\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s denials.President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.Getty ImagesRelated live-storyBiden pardons son Hunter as Trump forges ahead with presidential transitionThe case is one of several pending before the Supreme Court that faces an uncertain future in part because of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s election last month.

It also alleges that he sexually pursued female staffers, and that the organization ignored another staffer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s alleged sexual misconduct.The report is the latest scrutiny into Hegseth, a veteran and former Fox News host with no prior government experience, ahead of what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s expected to be a tough Senate confirmation process. It comes on the heels ofreports detailing a sexual assault allegationfrom 2017, which Hegseth has denied and in which no charges were filed.Asked by CNN for comment about the magazine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reporting, a Hegseth adviser said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to comment on outlandish claims laundered through the New Yorker by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s. Get back to us when you try your first attempt at actual journalism.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s team had provided The New Yorker with an identical statement.The seven-page whistleblower report was compiled by former employees of Concerned Veterans for America, the advocacy group where Hegseth was president from 2013 to 2016, and sent to its senior management in February 2015, The New Yorker reported. The magazine did not name the employees, and CNN has not independently reviewed the report.The report, according to The New Yorker, alleges that Hegseth had to be restrained from joining the dancers on stage at a Louisiana strip club where he had brought his team \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and that the organization ignored a female employee\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s allegation that another member of Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s staff attempted to sexually assault her at that strip club.It claims that his management team \u201a\u00c4\u00fasexually pursued\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 employees and divided the organization\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s female staffers into two groups \u201a\u00c4\u00ee \u201a\u00c4\u00faparty girls\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fanot party girls,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The New Yorker reported.In a separate complaint, which The New Yorker reported was emailed by a different employee to Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s successor as head of Concerned Veterans for America in late 2015, the employee alleged that while on a work trip to Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, Hegseth and someone traveling with the group\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Defend Freedom Tour closed down a hotel bar and yelled multiple times, \u201a\u00c4\u00faKill all Muslims!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9In the letter, the staffer criticized Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fadespicable behavior\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and said it \u201a\u00c4\u00faembarrassed the entire organization.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The staffer also wrote about another incident where Hegseth \u201a\u00c4\u00fapassed out\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the back of a party bus and then urinated in front of a hotel where the organization\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s team was staying, according to the magazine.The New Yorker reported that when reached for comment, the author of the letter, who was not named by the magazine, said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you print that, I will deny I wrote it.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time running Concerned Veterans for America came after an earlier, controversial tenure leading Vets for Freedom, a nonprofit backed by Republican billionaire megadonors.A former associate of the group, the magazine reported, said the group\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s donors became concerned about money being wasted on rumored parties that \u201a\u00c4\u00facould politely be called trysts,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and other inappropriate expenses. With the group mired in more than $500,000 in debt by early 2009, donors chose to wind it down and transfer most of its management to another veterans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 group. Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s role was reduced, and he ultimately departed years later.Margaret Hoover, a CNN political commentator who was an adviser to Vets for Freedom between 2008 and 2010, told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Erin Burnett last month that Hegseth ran the organization \u201a\u00c4\u00favery poorly\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and lost donors\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 confidence.

The accuser told police that Hegseth physically blocked her from leaving a hotel room, took her phone and then sexually assaulted her.The Monterey County district attorney told CNN last month said that her office declined to file charges against Hegseth in January 2018 because \u201a\u00c4\u00fano charges were supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She declined to comment further. Hegseth insists that the encounter with the unnamed woman was consensual.Years later, Hegseth paid the accuser in a settlement agreement that included a confidentiality clause, his attorney Timothy Parlatore told CNN in a statement last month. Parlatore said Hegseth settled because it was during the \u201a\u00c4\u00faMe Too\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 movement and he didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to lose his job at Fox News if the accusation became public. The statement did not share how much the accuser was paid as part of the settlement, although Parlatore said it was \u201a\u00c4\u00faa significantly reduced amount.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Hegseth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s alleged conduct toward women came under further scrutiny over the weekend, when The New York Times reported thathis mother sent an emailto her son in 2018 that sharply criticized his treatment of women.Penelope Hegseth told her son in the email that there are \u201a\u00c4\u00famany\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 women whom he has \u201a\u00c4\u00faabused in some way\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and encouraged him to \u201a\u00c4\u00faget some help,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the email published by The Times.According to The Times\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 report, Penelope Hegseth wrote, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego.

The judges overseeing his cases will likely cancel the sentencing hearings, which were slated for December 12 in the gun case and December 16 in the tax case.The broadly crafted pardon explicitly grants clemency for the tax and gun offenses from his existing cases, plus any potential federal crimes that Hunter Biden may have committed \u201cfrom January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024.\u201d This time frame, importantly, covers his entire tenure on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma and much of his other overseas work, including in China. Hehad faced scrutinyfor his controversial foreign business dealings, and Trump has repeatedly said he should be prosecuted for his activities in Ukraine and elsewhere.Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers on Sunday night formally notified the judges in his criminal cases about the pardon \u2014 and he said in a sworn affidavit that he has accepted the pardon from his father.In new court filings, Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers told the judges in both of his cases that the pardon \u201crequires dismissal of the Indictment against him with prejudice and adjournment of all future proceedings in this matter.\u201dJoe Biden said in his statement that he decided to issue the pardon because his son was \u201cselectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\u201d saying that \u201cHunter was treated differently\u201d from people who commit similar crimes.The president said his political opponents in Congress \u201cinstigated\u201d the charges \u201cto attack me and oppose my election.\u201dPresident Joe Biden speaks on the South Lawn of the White House on December 1, in Washington, DC.Nathan Posner/Anadolu/Getty ImagesanalysisBiden\u2019s pardon of his son pours fuel on Trump\u2019s claims of politicized justiceHe said in his statement, \u201cI believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice. \u2026 I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.\u201dThe president further claimed Hunter Biden was \u201csingled out\u201d for prosecution \u201conly because he is my son\u201d \u2014 allegations that were previously raised by Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers and resoundingly rejected by two federal judges.

He also argued that many people who pay back all of their late taxes, like Hunter did, are allowed to resolve their problems through civil enforcement, instead of facing criminal charges.This is the latest instance of an outgoing president using the pardon power to help a family member: Shortly before they both left office, Bill Clinton pardoned his brother and Donald Trump pardoned the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner.\u201cAs sympathetic as Hunter Biden\u2019s circumstances might be, a pardon from Joe Biden would still be an abuse of the clemency power,\u201d said Jeffrey Crouch, a leading expert on pardons who teaches at American University. \u201cPresidents should not use clemency to help out their friends, family and allies in order to further their own personal interest.\u201dHoliday decisionAs much as Joe Biden had hoped to remain deferential to the judicial system \u2014 and even after promising to stay out of the case \u2014 sources told CNN the president decided after Thanksgiving that a pardon was the right move.\u201cHe feels Hunter was targeted in order for his political opponents to hurt him and that was cruel and he endured enough,\u201d a White House official familiar with the situation told CNN on Sunday. \u201cOnce he made it, there was no sense in delaying it further.\u201dOne thing that particularly swayed the president: a belief that Republicans were trying to \u201cbreak Hunter,\u201d as he said in his statement, while his son was still recovering from addiction.

The language mirrored much of what the president said in his Sunday statement explaining his decision to pardon his son.In the wake of Trump\u2019s election victory last month, White House aides began to sense that a pardon \u2014 or a commutation of the younger Biden\u2019s sentences \u2014 was a distinct possibility.
