Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., the boot last month in favor of a young, energetic and successful businessman who says he's ready to defend their interests in the nation's capital.\nRepublican Rep.-elect Rob Bresnahan, 34, tells Fox News Digital in an interview that \"kitchen table issues\" helped him connect with northeastern Pennsylvanians and oust Cartwright, a progressive who had served in Congress for more than a decade.\n\"When we were knocking on doors and talking to people every single day over a period of 13 months, the first thing anyone had to say was, \u2018I can\u2019t afford my bills. I can't afford rent. I can't afford my mortgage. I can't afford school property taxes. I can't afford groceries,'\" Bresnahan said.\nRising prices for food and gas have made living costs unaffordable for Pennsylvanians, he explained. And as voters have watched illegal immigrants overrun the southern border and be provided free food, housing and benefits, while billions in foreign aid flows out from the U.S. to other countries, they felt that foreigners were being treated better than Americans by their government, said Bresnahan.\nPENNSYLVANIA DEMOCRAT REP. MATT CARTWRIGHT CONCEDES RACE TO GOP CHALLENGER\nDemocratic Pennsylvania Rep. Matt Cartwright and Republican Pennsylvania House candidate Rob Bresnahan.(Getty Images/Rob for PA)\n\"We're looking around at our neighbors saying, \u2018hey, what about us here?\u2019 And they couldn't help but feel that they have been put second for a long time.\"\nBresnahan was a success story before he won election to theHouse of Representatives. A fifth-generation native of Luzerne County, at just 19 years old he was entrusted to be CFO of his grandfather's construction company, which builds electrical infrastructure for municipalities and highways throughout Pennsylvania.\nHe spent his college years at the University of Scranton dashing back and forth between the office and class as he worked to help the business recover from the global financial crisis. His hard work paid off, the business grew and Bresnahan became CEO after graduating in 2013.\n\"I was still living at home with my parents and I was in and out of a dorm room and running a company with 58 employees even though I couldn\u2019t legally drink a Coors Light yet,\" he told the Citizen's Voice in 2021. \"The combination was a heavy workload but it was a sacrifice that I would make again in a second.\"\nBut as the years passed, Bresnahan, like many Americans, felt the country was headed on the wrong track. The decisions coming from Washington, D.C., were bad for his business, his employees and the people they serve. And so, he decided to enter politics to make a difference.\n\"I felt that the country was not heading in the right trajectory with what is happening on our southern border. We had life essentially unaffordable for the average person. And I've always been a person to roll up my sleeves and throw myself into fire,\" Bresnahan said.\nPA DEM IN DISTRICT THAT VOTED FOR TRUMP SAYS HE'S A MODERATE, BUT VOTING RECORD TELLS ANOTHER STORY\nRob Bresnahan, Republican nominee for Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District, takes the stage during a Trump campaign rally at Riverfront Sports on Oct. 9, 2024 in Scranton, Pennsylvania.(Getty Images)\nHis winning congressional campaign focused on securing the border, cutting taxes and trimming government spending, creating \"family-sustaining jobs\" in the Keystone State and supporting law enforcement. In April, Bresnahan received an endorsement from President-electDonald Trump.\n\"A successful Businessman, Rob has worked hard to Create Jobs and Grow the Economy, unlike his opponent, Matt Cartwright, who is completely beholden to Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.\nWith the campaign behind him, Bresnahan says he and the other members of the incoming Republican majority in Congress are ready to hit the ground running with a pro-growth agenda in January.\n\"Securing the border. That needs to be done day one, Jan. 3 at 12:01 p.m., the day after we are all sworn in,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I think there's going to be a big playbook, but that is a tangible win right off the bat.\"\nSINGLE HOUSE RACE STANDS BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND 1-SEAT MAJORITY\nA view of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 4, 2024, ahead of the 2024 presidential election.(Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nOn inflation, Bresnahan says Congress and the Trump administration can tackle unaffordable prices by lowering energy costs. \"Talking about just Pennsylvania alone, 52% of homes are heated from natural gas. $45 billion a year are generated from the natural gas industry, and $76 billion in GDP comes out of the fracking and natural gas industry,\" he said, insisting that policymakers must stop \"vilifying natural resources.\"\nThe rising national debt, at $36 trillion, is another burden on the economy Bresnahan says Congress must address. \"We're spending more on debt servicing \u2013 just our national debt and the interest \u2013 than we are on our national defense budget.\"\nThe young lawmaker said there will be \"tough votes\" on discretionary spending when Congress convenes in January. But two of the largest contributors to the federal debt and deficit will remain untouched.\n\"Obviously, we can't cut Medicare. We can't cut Social Security. We have to preserve that for our current generation, and we have to find ways to preserve it for our generation and the next generation. But I don't believe that there's a one-size-fits-all policy on any circumstance, let alone the national debt and the expenditures of the federal government,\" Bresnahan said.\nHowever, he added that illegal immigrants should not benefit from programs that Americans have paid in to, including Social Security and Medicare.\nREPUBLICANS PROJECTED TO KEEP CONTROL OF HOUSE AS TRUMP PREPARES TO IMPLEMENT AGENDA\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., is expected to keep his job after Republicans held on to their House majority.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\nRepublicans are expected to extend the 2017 tax cuts that became law during Trump's first term in office. Bresnahan says he supports those tax cuts and insists that economic growth spurred by deregulation and investments in infrastructure and American jobs can make up for any potential revenue losses.\n\"We have to get people back to work,\" he said. \"We have to create economic climates that are conducive to the American people to incentivize them to go to work.\"\nPart of that is to support jobs that don't require a college degree, such as carpenters, plumbers or electricians. \"These are great, family-sustaining careers with annuities starting on day one, with health insurance for your family, and you're earning while you learn.\"\nTurning to foreign policy, Bresnahan said the United States must remain a global superpower and pursue \"peace through strength.\"\n\"But we have to be strong as the United States,\" he added. Asked about growing GOP opposition to foreign aid, including to Ukraine, Bresnahan emphasized that he supports efforts to push back against Russian aggression \u2013 but he wants to do so responsibly.\nYOUNGEST HOUSE REPUBLICAN-ELECT REVEALS HOW GOP WON BACK AMERICA'S YOUTH\n\"Putin is a war criminal and needs to be stopped,\" he said. \"I am all supportive of providing weapons, missiles, rockets \u2013 actually, there's a big manufacturing facility inside of my district. But where I do want accountability is the raw, hard dollars that have been sent. I want audits done on those to ensure they're going to the right causes.\"\nEchoing Trump's beliefs about putting America first, Bresnahan said there is a point where \"enough is enough\" and that Europe has to match U.S. contributions to foreign aid.\n\"Again, I'm looking at, you know, 25% of my bridges are structurally deficient. We have aging infrastructure levees that protect over $1 trillion of property here in the United States. You're talking about power distribution grids that haven't been re-invested in since the 1950s with 50 years of usable life. And, you know, we were without power for multiple days now, going on which could possibly be a week (Editor's note: A blizzard in Breshanan's district had postponed this interview). Europe didn't come and send over trucks to help us rebuild our grids.\"\n\"Ukraine obviously has a lot going on, but we need to take care of our own people. We have to take care of our own Americans. And I believe Donald Trump had that narrative and that's why he just won an election in a landslide, because it's about us,\" he added.\nBresnahan hopes to bring \"common sense\" solutions to the complex problems facing Americans. He has pledged to work with whomever has a good idea, Republican or Democrat, and has earned endorsements from both No Labels and the moderate Problem Solvers Caucus. Though he calls himself a \"fiscal conservative,\" he rejects political labels because \"I don't think confirmation bias is the right way to solve any issue.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I believe most challenges can be overcome through healthy and solid debate,\" he added.\nAnd what about those issues that inflame passions on both sides? Before this interview, Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., made national headlines after she put forward a resolution that would bar Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., a transgender lawmaker who is biologically male, from using the women's bathrooms in the capitol.\nBresnahan said that while he believes biological men should not play in women's sports or use their facilities, the flare up between Mace and McBride distracts from other important issues facing Americans \u2013 like crumbling infrastructure and expensive living costs.\n\"I don't want the 119th Congress to be hijacked by what bathrooms we should be using when we have been elected to provide real solutions for the real American people. And that's what I'm going down to Washington, D.C. to do.\"\nFox News Digital's Emma Colton contributed to this report.\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.\nChris Pandolfo is a breaking news reporter for Fox News Digital.

Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., the boot last month in favor of a young, energetic and successful businessman who says he's ready to defend their interests in the nation's capital.\nRepublican Rep.-elect Rob Bresnahan, 34, tells Fox News Digital in an interview that \"kitchen table issues\" helped him connect with northeastern Pennsylvanians and oust Cartwright, a progressive who had served in Congress for more than a decade.\n\"When we were knocking on doors and talking to people every single day over a period of 13 months, the first thing anyone had to say was, \u2018I can\u2019t afford my bills. I can't afford rent. I can't afford my mortgage. I can't afford school property taxes. I can't afford groceries,'\" Bresnahan said.\nRising prices for food and gas have made living costs unaffordable for Pennsylvanians, he explained. And as voters have watched illegal immigrants overrun the southern border and be provided free food, housing and benefits, while billions in foreign aid flows out from the U.S. to other countries, they felt that foreigners were being treated better than Americans by their government, said Bresnahan.\nPENNSYLVANIA DEMOCRAT REP. MATT CARTWRIGHT CONCEDES RACE TO GOP CHALLENGER\nDemocratic Pennsylvania Rep. Matt Cartwright and Republican Pennsylvania House candidate Rob Bresnahan.(Getty Images/Rob for PA)\n\"We're looking around at our neighbors saying, \u2018hey, what about us here?\u2019 And they couldn't help but feel that they have been put second for a long time.\"\nBresnahan was a success story before he won election to theHouse of Representatives. A fifth-generation native of Luzerne County, at just 19 years old he was entrusted to be CFO of his grandfather's construction company, which builds electrical infrastructure for municipalities and highways throughout Pennsylvania.\nHe spent his college years at the University of Scranton dashing back and forth between the office and class as he worked to help the business recover from the global financial crisis. His hard work paid off, the business grew and Bresnahan became CEO after graduating in 2013.\n\"I was still living at home with my parents and I was in and out of a dorm room and running a company with 58 employees even though I couldn\u2019t legally drink a Coors Light yet,\" he told the Citizen's Voice in 2021. \"The combination was a heavy workload but it was a sacrifice that I would make again in a second.\"\nBut as the years passed, Bresnahan, like many Americans, felt the country was headed on the wrong track. The decisions coming from Washington, D.C., were bad for his business, his employees and the people they serve. And so, he decided to enter politics to make a difference.\n\"I felt that the country was not heading in the right trajectory with what is happening on our southern border. We had life essentially unaffordable for the average person. And I've always been a person to roll up my sleeves and throw myself into fire,\" Bresnahan said.\nPA DEM IN DISTRICT THAT VOTED FOR TRUMP SAYS HE'S A MODERATE, BUT VOTING RECORD TELLS ANOTHER STORY\nRob Bresnahan, Republican nominee for Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District, takes the stage during a Trump campaign rally at Riverfront Sports on Oct. 9, 2024 in Scranton, Pennsylvania.(Getty Images)\nHis winning congressional campaign focused on securing the border, cutting taxes and trimming government spending, creating \"family-sustaining jobs\" in the Keystone State and supporting law enforcement. In April, Bresnahan received an endorsement from President-electDonald Trump.\n\"A successful Businessman, Rob has worked hard to Create Jobs and Grow the Economy, unlike his opponent, Matt Cartwright, who is completely beholden to Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.\nWith the campaign behind him, Bresnahan says he and the other members of the incoming Republican majority in Congress are ready to hit the ground running with a pro-growth agenda in January.\n\"Securing the border. That needs to be done day one, Jan. 3 at 12:01 p.m., the day after we are all sworn in,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I think there's going to be a big playbook, but that is a tangible win right off the bat.\"\nSINGLE HOUSE RACE STANDS BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND 1-SEAT MAJORITY\nA view of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 4, 2024, ahead of the 2024 presidential election.(Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nOn inflation, Bresnahan says Congress and the Trump administration can tackle unaffordable prices by lowering energy costs. \"Talking about just Pennsylvania alone, 52% of homes are heated from natural gas. $45 billion a year are generated from the natural gas industry, and $76 billion in GDP comes out of the fracking and natural gas industry,\" he said, insisting that policymakers must stop \"vilifying natural resources.\"\nThe rising national debt, at $36 trillion, is another burden on the economy Bresnahan says Congress must address. \"We're spending more on debt servicing \u2013 just our national debt and the interest \u2013 than we are on our national defense budget.\"\nThe young lawmaker said there will be \"tough votes\" on discretionary spending when Congress convenes in January. But two of the largest contributors to the federal debt and deficit will remain untouched.\n\"Obviously, we can't cut Medicare. We can't cut Social Security. We have to preserve that for our current generation, and we have to find ways to preserve it for our generation and the next generation. But I don't believe that there's a one-size-fits-all policy on any circumstance, let alone the national debt and the expenditures of the federal government,\" Bresnahan said.\nHowever, he added that illegal immigrants should not benefit from programs that Americans have paid in to, including Social Security and Medicare.\nREPUBLICANS PROJECTED TO KEEP CONTROL OF HOUSE AS TRUMP PREPARES TO IMPLEMENT AGENDA\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., is expected to keep his job after Republicans held on to their House majority.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\nRepublicans are expected to extend the 2017 tax cuts that became law during Trump's first term in office. Bresnahan says he supports those tax cuts and insists that economic growth spurred by deregulation and investments in infrastructure and American jobs can make up for any potential revenue losses.\n\"We have to get people back to work,\" he said. \"We have to create economic climates that are conducive to the American people to incentivize them to go to work.\"\nPart of that is to support jobs that don't require a college degree, such as carpenters, plumbers or electricians. \"These are great, family-sustaining careers with annuities starting on day one, with health insurance for your family, and you're earning while you learn.\"\nTurning to foreign policy, Bresnahan said the United States must remain a global superpower and pursue \"peace through strength.\"\n\"But we have to be strong as the United States,\" he added. Asked about growing GOP opposition to foreign aid, including to Ukraine, Bresnahan emphasized that he supports efforts to push back against Russian aggression \u2013 but he wants to do so responsibly.\nYOUNGEST HOUSE REPUBLICAN-ELECT REVEALS HOW GOP WON BACK AMERICA'S YOUTH\n\"Putin is a war criminal and needs to be stopped,\" he said. \"I am all supportive of providing weapons, missiles, rockets \u2013 actually, there's a big manufacturing facility inside of my district. But where I do want accountability is the raw, hard dollars that have been sent. I want audits done on those to ensure they're going to the right causes.\"\nEchoing Trump's beliefs about putting America first, Bresnahan said there is a point where \"enough is enough\" and that Europe has to match U.S. contributions to foreign aid.\n\"Again, I'm looking at, you know, 25% of my bridges are structurally deficient. We have aging infrastructure levees that protect over $1 trillion of property here in the United States. You're talking about power distribution grids that haven't been re-invested in since the 1950s with 50 years of usable life. And, you know, we were without power for multiple days now, going on which could possibly be a week (Editor's note: A blizzard in Breshanan's district had postponed this interview). Europe didn't come and send over trucks to help us rebuild our grids.\"\n\"Ukraine obviously has a lot going on, but we need to take care of our own people. We have to take care of our own Americans. And I believe Donald Trump had that narrative and that's why he just won an election in a landslide, because it's about us,\" he added.\nBresnahan hopes to bring \"common sense\" solutions to the complex problems facing Americans. He has pledged to work with whomever has a good idea, Republican or Democrat, and has earned endorsements from both No Labels and the moderate Problem Solvers Caucus. Though he calls himself a \"fiscal conservative,\" he rejects political labels because \"I don't think confirmation bias is the right way to solve any issue.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I believe most challenges can be overcome through healthy and solid debate,\" he added.\nAnd what about those issues that inflame passions on both sides? Before this interview, Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., made national headlines after she put forward a resolution that would bar Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., a transgender lawmaker who is biologically male, from using the women's bathrooms in the capitol.\nBresnahan said that while he believes biological men should not play in women's sports or use their facilities, the flare up between Mace and McBride distracts from other important issues facing Americans \u2013 like crumbling infrastructure and expensive living costs.\n\"I don't want the 119th Congress to be hijacked by what bathrooms we should be using when we have been elected to provide real solutions for the real American people. And that's what I'm going down to Washington, D.C. to do.\"\nFox News Digital's Emma Colton contributed to this report.\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.\nChris Pandolfo is a breaking news reporter for Fox News Digital.

These are some of the controversies he has been engulfed in over the decades.\nSharpton has built a reputation for playing fast and loose when it comes to his taxes.

Skrmetti,centers on a Tennessee lawthat bans gender-transition treatments for adolescents in the state. The law also takes aim at health care providers in Tennessee who continue to provide gender-transition treatments to transgender minors, opening them up to fines, lawsuits and other liability.\nThe petitioners in the case are the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which sued to overturn the Tennessee law on behalf of parents of three transgender adolescents, and a Memphis-based doctor who treats transgender patients. The petitioners were also joined by the Biden administration earlier this year under a federal law that allows the administration to intervene in certain cases certified by the attorney general to be of \"general public importance.\"\nThe petitioners argue the law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The state has responded by insisting the law does not discriminate based on gender, arguing it sets parameters on age- and use-based restrictions on certain drugs and is thereforenot a violation of the Constitution.\nBIDEN'S SWEEPING HUNTER PARDON AT ODDS WITH LONGTIME RHETORIC ON EXECUTIVE POWER: 'NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW'\nPro-transgender protesters rally for inclusion. Petitioners in U.S. v. Skrmetti will argue before the Supreme Court that transgender individuals have all the hallmarks of a \"quasi-suspect class\" under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.(Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images)\nAccording to the U.S. Supreme Court website, the key question posed in the case is \"whether Tennessee Senate Bill 1 (SBl), which prohibits all medical treatments intended to allow 'a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex' or to treat 'purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity,' Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1), violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\nWednesday's oral arguments mark the first time the Supreme Court will consider restrictions on puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery for minors, giving the case importance in Tennessee and in other states across the country.\nTennessee passedits law, Senate Bill 1, in March 2023. But it is just one of at least 25 U.S. states that has banned gender transition care for transgender adolescents, making the case \u2014 and Wednesday's oral arguments \u2014 one of the most high-profile cases to be heard this session.\nThe oral arguments have beenanticipated for months.The controversial case comes at a time in Washington when Republicans will regain control of the White House and both chambers of Congress next month, giving them heavy influence and, some fear, more control over the federal judiciary.\nHere's what you need to know ahead of Wednesday's oral arguments.\nWho's arguing the case?\nThe petitioners will be represented by U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar and Chase Strangio, an ACLU attorney who represented the original parties in the lawsuit.\nStrangio, the deputy director for transgender justice for the ACLU\u2019s LGBTQ and HIV Project, will be the first openly transgender person to argue before the Supreme Court.\nThe respondents in the case, namely the state of Tennessee, will be represented in court by Tennessee Solicitor General J. Matthew Rice and the state attorney general, Jonathan Skrmetti.\nIn a court filing submitted ahead of Wednesday's oral arguments, Prelogar's office argued the Tennessee law has a deliberate focus on \"sex and gender conformity,\" asserting Senate Bill 1 \"declares that its very purpose is to \u2018encourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex' and to ban treatments \u2018that might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.'\"\n\"That,\" the federal government wrote, \"is sex discrimination.\"\nCounsel for the petitioners willargue that the Tennessee lawimposes \"differential treatment based on the sex an individual is assigned at birth,\" triggering a higher level of scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.\nHUNTER BIDEN GUN CASE TERMINATED AFTER PARDON, BUT FEDERAL JUDGE STOPS SHORT OF FULL DISMISSAL\nThey will also argue that upholding the ban will represent a \"dangerous and discriminatory affront\" to transgender minors not just in Tennessee, but across the country, a point that has been emphasized by Strangio.\nThe state argued in a court filing that the law \"contains no sex classification\" warranting the heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. Rather, it said, it \"creates two groups: minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes.\"\nThe question of scrutiny\nThe Supreme Court has determined three different levels of scrutiny that help determine whether a law is permissible under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution: Strict scrutiny, heightened scrutiny and rational basis. The highest level, strict scrutiny, requires a law be passed to serve a compelling government interest and be narrowly tailored to minimize harm.\nThe second level of scrutiny, or \"heightened scrutiny,\" requires the governmental body to prove its actions further an \"important government interest\" by using means \"substantially related to that interest.\"\nThe lowest bar, rational basis, is the most deferential of the tests and requires the law only serve a legitimate interest with a \"rational connection\" to the means and goals of the statute.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court at sunset(Aaron Schwartz/SIPA USA)\nOverview of the arguments\nWednesday's oral arguments will center on whether banning gender transition care for minors violates protections under the Equal Protection Clause, either via gender discrimination or discrimination against their transgender status.\nThe petitioners in the case will argue that the Tennessee law discriminates against individuals and their right to receive the same medical treatments based on their sex. Under the law, the petitioners argued in their court filing, \"an adolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or testosterone to live as a male, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can.\"\nTRUMP'S AG PICK HAS \u2018HISTORY OF CONSENSUS BUILDING\u2019\nSeparately, they will argue that discriminating against individuals based on their transgender status is also sufficient to trigger higher scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, noting that transgender individuals \"satisfy all of the hallmarks of a quasi-suspect class,\" including being subject to discrimination, representing a \"discrete and identifiable minority\" and other components outlined by the Supreme Court, thereby necessitating that heightened scrutiny be applied.\nThe respondents will argue that Senate Bill 1, places age- and use-based restrictions on certain drugs and, therefore, is not an example of unconstitutional discrimination.\nFurther, they will argue that the law easily passes even the test of heightened scrutiny. The state contends it has \"compelling interests\" to protect the health and safety of minors in the state and \"in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession.\"\nThe U.S. Supreme Court(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\nCase history\nU.S. District Judge Eli Richardson, a Trump appointee, granted a preliminary inunction for part of the Tennessee ban in June, siding with the petitioners' assertion that \"parents have a fundamental right to direct the medical care of their children, which naturally includes the right of parent[s] to request certain medical treatments on behalf of their children[.]\"\nHe said the ban on most types of gender care for transgender minors would likely not survive the heightened scrutiny test under the Equal Protection Clause, since the same treatments were not banned for their non-transgender peers.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit later overturned the district court's decision and reinstated the full ban, using the lowest test of rational basis. The petitioners appealed that decision to the Supreme Court, which agreed in June to review the case.\nThe petitioners have asked the Supreme Court to remand the case to the 6th Circuit Court to hear it again, this time using the test of heightened scrutiny.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nStrangio hasrepeatedly stressedthe wide-ranging impact the Supreme Court decision could have on \"countless transgender youth\" of current and future generations and has described the bans as a \"dangerous and discriminatory affront to the well-being of transgender youth across the country.\"\nNext steps\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule on United States v. Skrmetti by July 2025.

And they don\u2019t trust the media to deliver basic facts about Washington without bias and blunders.\nThese sentiments have basically been growing for the last 60 years, since the lies about Vietnam merged with the lies about Watergate and forced Richard Nixon to resign.\nBIDEN, TRUMP BOTH RIP DOJ AFTER PRESIDENT PARDONS HUNTER\nBut the most sensitive federal agency, everyone would agree, is theJustice Department, including the FBI. Donald Trump has been attacking these agencies for years (along with the \"fake news\"), accusing them of politically persecuting him. He campaigned outside courthouses by telling reporters the prosecutors and judges were awful people who were out to get him solely because he was the leading candidate to win back the White House.\nJoe Biden, by breaking his promise not to pardon his son Hunter, did more than just lie. He ripped his own DOJ for \"selectively and unfairly prosecuting\" his son.\nI used to patrol the endless hallways of the J. Edgar Hoover building as the Justice Department beat reporter. On the criminal side, it is supposed to be independent, since Justice often winds up investigating the administration. Back in the day it was filled with fair-minded career prosecutors who pursued legitimate leads regardless of party.\nU.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump are pictured in front of the United States Department of Justice Headquarters.(Getty Images)\nIn sayingthat Hunter Bidenwas singled out for harsh treatment, the outgoing president is making the same argument as the incoming president, that the department is badly biased. Little wonder that so many people don\u2019t trust DOJ.\nAll Biden had to do when repeatedly asked about a pardon or commutation was \"I\u2019m not going to discuss hypotheticals.\" Then at least he wouldn\u2019t have the lying part.\nThere is no question that Pam Bondi, despite some roughing up, will be the next attorney general, having precisely the experience (Florida AG, career prosecutor) that Matt Gaetz so blatantly lacked. She is not going to blow up the department.\nBut in picking Kash Patel torun the FBI\u2013 and ignoring that Chris Wray is not through with his 10-year term \u2013 Trump is sending a very different message.

It\u2019s in the nominee\u2019s own words.\nTRUMP HIT FOR HIRING LOYALISTS LIKE PAM BONDI: DOESN\u2019T EVERY PRESIDENT DO THAT?\nPatel has vowed to shut down the bureau\u2019s Washington headquarters. He said last year on Steve Bannon\u2019s podcast, which we played on \"Media Buzz\": \"We will go out and find the conspirators\u2026not just in government, but in the media.\u2026 Whether it\u2019s criminally or civilly, we\u2019ll figure that out.\"\nIn his 2022 book \"Government Gangsters,\" Patel names 60 people as part of the deep state,\u00a0 \"a cabal of unelected tyrants\u2026the most dangerous threat to our democracy.\" The press has dubbed this an enemies list.\nIt includes the aforementioned Bill Barr (for blocking his appointment), NSC chairman John Bolton (an \"arrogant control freak\"), and Defense Secretary Mark Esper (who tried to fire him).\nHunter Biden, son of U.S. President Joe Biden departs the J.

And having worked for Trump hardly provides immunity.\nPatel would have his work cut out for him, though he\u2019d have to get a career prosecutor to submit a wiretap request or search warrant to the courts.\nMeanwhile, manyDemocratic lawmakersare hitting their party\u2019s president pretty hard for the Hunter pardon, in interviewswith the Times.\nColorado Congressman Jason Crow: He promised he would not do this.

Michael Bennet said the Biden move \"put personal interest ahead of duty and further erodes Americans\u2019 faith that the justice system is fair and equal for all.\" And his late dropout from the race was also \"putting his personal interest ahead of his responsibility to the country.\"\nVermont Sen. Peter Welch: \"President Biden\u2019s pardon of his son Hunter is, as the action of a loving father, understandable \u2014 but as the action of our nation\u2019s chief executive, unwise.\"\nMichigan Sen. Gary Peters: \"Wrong.\"\nPretty bracing stuff.\nSome progressives defended Biden, such as Texas Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett: \"Way to go Joe!\" She said a 34-count convicted felon is about to walk into the White House, perhaps missing the news that Jack Smith has dropped the charges.\nOn \"Morning Joe\" yesterday, Mika Brzezinski, while saying she wished Biden hadn\u2019t promised no pardon, took on the coverage: \"You look at what has happened on the Trump side, especially if you even parallel pardons that Trump has done himself, it\u2019s just always so \u2014 it seems so hysterically imbalanced!\"\nJoe Scarborough spoke of \"the frustration that many Democrats are having on the New York Times, The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, a lot of mainstream organizations blowing this up to the size that they believe is really out of proportion, given everything Donald Trump has done in the past and what he\u2019s doing right now.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nStill, the two presidents have wound up in the same place in their view of the Justice Department as partisan and politicized.\nOne fascinating tidbit dug up by the Times: When Biden had Trump to the White House, according to three sources, and listened to his familiar grievances about the biased DOJ \u2013 the president-elect \"surprised his host by sympathizing with the Biden family\u2019s own troubles with the department.\"\nHoward Kurtz is the host of FOX News Channel'sMediaBuzz(Sundays 11 a.m.-12 p.m. ET).\u00a0Based in Washington, D.C., he joined the network in July 2013 and regularly appears onSpecial Report with Bret Baierand other programs."}, {"source": "foxnews", "title": "Biden, Trump both rip DOJ after president pardons Hunter", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-trump-both-rip-doj-after-president-pardons-hunter", "content": "Political strategist Lucy Caldwell and senior editor for Reason Magazine Robby Soave react to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s selection for Attorney General, Pam Bondi.\nThere is no other way to put it:Joe Bidenlied. Over and over.\nAfter repeatedly promising, pledging, vowing not to pardon his son Hunter, the President of the United States did exactly that.\nThe move amounted to a devastating vote of no confidence in his own Justice Department, matchingDonald Trump\u2019sown denunciations of that very department.\nPRESIDENT BIDEN PARDONS SON HUNTER, SPARING HIM POSSIBLE PRISON SENTENCE\nTrump, who also pardoned several political allies during his first term, was quick to react on Truth Social:\n\"Does the pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\"\nAnd prominent Republicans are calling Biden a liar, with ample justification.\nBoth President Biden and President-elect Trump railed against the Justice Department following the former's pardon of his son, Hunter \u2013 albeit for markedly different reasons.(Reuters/Getty/AP Images)\nI think most people assumed that a father wouldn\u2019t let his son go to jail. And if the president had explained it in those terms, he might have garnered some public sympathy. But he did not.\nYou know how the president often talks about \"my word as a Biden\"? I mistakenly assumed that he wouldn\u2019t promise again and again not to pardon his son or commute his sentence if he had thought there was any possibility he would get Hunter off the legal hook.\nBut what is anyone going to do? He leaves office next month, his political career is over and the story will quickly fade.\nMEDIA ADMITS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS TOO 'WOKE' AFTER KAMALA HARRIS' 2024 LOSS\nBiden sounded very much like Trump as he accused the DOJ, which he had long defended, of treating his son unfairly \u2013 swinging the political door wide open for the president-elect to retaliate against Justice, in part by naming longtime confidant Kash Patel to runthe FBI.\nBiden said his son had been \"selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\" and he blamed\u00a0 political pressure on the special counsel named in the case.\n\"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter\u2019s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2014 and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter \u2014 who has been 5-1/2 years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they\u2019ve tried to break me \u2014 and there\u2019s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.\"\nMany were mistaken in their assumption that the President wouldn't pardon his son \u2013 however, with just under two months left of his term, and, presumably, his political career, Biden really has nothing to lose in doing so.(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\nBut that bolsters the Trump argument that he too was singled out for selective prosecution by the DOJ \u2013 and will be in a position to do something about it.\nHunter put out his own statement after the Sunday pardon: \"I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction \u2014 mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport.\"\nThe feeble attempts by some in the media and in Democratic politics to defend Biden are just sad, because they only tell half the story.\nLet\u2019s say Hunter Biden was in fact singled out for prosecution, that the case would have been routinely disposed of if his last name was Jones. (Hunter had already been convicted in one case and pleaded guilty in another to tax and gun-related charges.)\nBut as Hunter admitted in one email, it was his last name, when his father was vice president, that enabled him to land all those buckraking contracts from around the world. It\u2019s why the Ukrainian energy giant Burisma hired him, why he was able to get moneyfrom China.\nTRUMP HIT FOR HIRING LOYALISTS LIKE PAM BONDI: DOESN\u2019T EVERY PRESIDENT DO THAT?\nHunter had no expertise in any of these areas. What he had was a connection to a powerful father.\nThe pardon is so sweeping that it covers everything Hunter may have done from Jan. 1, 2004 through Sunday \u2013 which could be a way of his father protecting himself as well.\nKarine Jean-Pierre also told reporters on several occasions that Biden would not pardon Hunter.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeatedly assured reporters that President Biden wouldn't pardon Hunter.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\nHunter Bidenon Sunday night released a statement noting his recovery from addiction and his sobriety:\n\"I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction \u2014 mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport.\"\nMark Halperin argues that Biden put his son in jeopardy by running for president, knowing the full range of Hunter\u2019s addiction problems \u2013 and lied about Hunter not getting money from China and not helping his business clients (even if he just made small talk at a couple of group meetings).\nTRUMP NOMINATES KASH PATEL TO SERVE AS FBI DIRECTOR: 'ADVOCATE FOR TRUTH'\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s choice of Kash Patel for the FBI (who would replace his own appointee, Chris Wray, who replaced the fired Jim Comey) has sparked a media backlash.\nOne thing no one can argue is that Patel lacks experience. He has been chief of staff atthe Pentagonand a deputy assistant to the president. In fact, he was a national security prosecutor in the Obama Justice Department, before Trump got into politics.\nBut on Steve Bannon\u2019s podcast last year, Patel said: \"Yes, we're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections. We're going to come after you, whether it's criminally or civilly.\"\nThe president-elect is facing a media firestorm of his own after he named Kash Patel the new FBI director over the weekend.(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\nPatel has also said that on day one he\u2019d shut down the FBI headquarters in Washington \u2013 ironically named for J. Edgar Hoover \u2013 and turn it into a museum on the \"deep state.\" Its 7,000 employees would be dispersed around the country.\nOne thing Biden never did was put any family members on the government payroll, as Trump did in naming Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, to top White House positions in the first term.\nNow Trump is continuing that tradition by naming Charles Kushner, Jared\u2019s father, as ambassador to France.\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\nThe elder Kushner had already served a couple of years in prison for a scheme that involved hiring a prostitute and sending the tape to his sister. But at least he had paid his dues when Trump later pardoned him, sparking Jared\u2019s interest in prison reform.\nTrump also picked Massad Boulos \u2013 the father of Tiffany Trump\u2019s husband \u2013 as White House adviser on Arab andMiddle Eastaffairs. All in the family.\nOne thing the press does is refer to Trump nominees as \"loyalists,\" as if that\u2019s a dirty word. Sunday\u2019s Washington Post had a headline describing \"loyalist Kash Patel.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBut while Biden named an inner circle of aides who had been with him as long as four decades, they were not dismissed as loyalists. That\u2019s because the media agree that these were the good guys. And who can forget former AG Eric Holder describing himself asBarack Obama\u2019s\"wingman.\"\nThe Hunter pardon has set in motion a potential cycle of both presidents using the DOJ and FBI for purely partisan ends, and Joe Biden bears full responsibility for that.\nHoward Kurtz is the host of FOX News Channel'sMediaBuzz(Sundays 11 a.m.-12 p.m. ET).\u00a0Based in Washington, D.C., he joined the network in July 2013 and regularly appears onSpecial Report with Bret Baierand other programs."}]
