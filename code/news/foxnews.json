Contests in Ohio, Montana, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are all battlegrounds. But it\u2019s a different story to understanding which might control the House.\nThe path to power isn\u2019t direct in the House.\nA patchwork of districts \u2013 hopscotching from northern Maine to the tundra of Alaska \u2013 might decide the House majority.\nSo on election night, let me decode the signs to interpret which party may serve inthe House majorityin 2025.\nREPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WITH NO GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, IT FEELS LIKE CHRISTMAS IN SEPTEMBER\nPresident Biden delivers his State of the Union address in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, March 7, 2024.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\nIt\u2019s about the math.\nLet\u2019s begin with the current breakdown in the House.\nThere are presently 432 House members. 220 Republicans and 212 Democrats. There are three vacancies.\nLate Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Tex., and Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., died. Former Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisc., resigned. None of theseare swing districts. So, if the House were at full membership with 435 seats, the breakdown would be 221 Republicans to 214 Democrats. The margin is seven. But Democrats only need a net gain of four seats to capture control. Also, note that some districts have morphed \u2013 especially in North Carolina \u2013 due to redistricting. In fact, Republicans could gain several seats there alone.\nSo here\u2019s the charge for Democrats: hold seats they currently have \u2013 and pluck off a handful of seats as they skip around the map. Also, make up the difference from what they will likely lose in the Tar Heel State. This is not a comprehensive list. But it will provide a general feel for the evening.\nHere\u2019s an early race to watch which could give a you a clue as to the direction of the House: Maine\u2019s 2nd District.\nA patchwork of districts \u2013 hopscotching from northern Maine to the tundra of Alaska \u2013 might decide the House majority.(Aaron Schwartz/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)\nRep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, faces Republican challenger andformer NASCAR driverAustin Theriault. This is a massive, rugged, rural district which stretches north to the Canadian border. Golden is one of the most moderate \u2013 and vulnerable Democrats in the House. Former President Trump won the singular electoral vote by carrying this district in 2020. Maine employs a proportional system to divide its electoral votes.\nIf Golden holds this seat, that could serve as an early canary in the coal mine indicating that Democrats are in good shape. But if Theriault prevails, that might signal the House could drift the other direction.\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HINTS AT ELECTION DAY TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS FOR VOTERS IMPACTED BY HURRICANES HELENE, MILTON\nPolitical analysts believethat Democrats lostthe House in New York in 2022. That\u2019s ironic because the former chairman of the Democrats reelection efforts two years ago, former Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., hailed from New York. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is from Brooklyn. That\u2019s to say nothing of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\nEmpire State Democrats have an opportunity to make significant inroads if they perform well in House races this year. The fact that it\u2019s a presidential election could also bolster Democratic performance in New York. Democrats already won back the seat occupied by formerRep. George Santos, R-N.Y., - who was expelled. But Democrats are angling to defeat freshman Reps. Anthony D\u2019Esposito, R-N.Y., Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., and Nick LaLota, R-N.Y. A clean sweep in the early returns sends a message that Democrats are performing substantially well on the evening of November 5. Democrats will be disappointed if they don\u2019t capture at least three of these seats.\nVirginia is also a place where both parties have pickup opportunities. A sweep by either side could reveal the overall direction of the night.\nFreshman Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., faces Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal in the Tidewater area. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., is retiring to run for governor next year. Democrat Eugene Vindman faces Republican Derrick Anderson to succeed Spanberger. The parties could split these races, making Virginia a wash.\nRep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., attends a press conference with Republican leadership on Capitol Hill on September 18, 2024, in Washington, D.C.(Win McNamee/Getty Images)\nVeteran Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio and freshman Rep. Emilia Sykes, D-Ohio, are bothdefending battleground districtsin a state which should go overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump. The fact that Republican Vice Presidential nominee and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, hails from the Buckeye State could influence voter turnout. It\u2019s a boon if Republicans are able to topple either Kaptur or Sykes. And Republicans could be looking at a grand slam if both Democrats lose. However, Kaptur is the longest-tenured woman in House history. Republicans have been trying to defeat her for years. It\u2019s far from clear that they can do so this year.\nDemocrats also have a shot at winning a redrawn seat in Alabama. A federal court decided that Alabama violated the Voting Rights Act by packing Black voters into a single majority Black district. The court ruled that Alabama must retool its Congressional maps, making what was once a Republican district into one favoring Democrats. Shomari Figures hopes to capture that district for the Democrats.\nIn Iowa, Democrats are eyeing two seats \u2013 although winning either may be a stretch. One seat pits Democrat Lanon Baccam against Rep. Zach Nunn, R-Iowa. Democrats also hope Christina Bohannan can unseat sophomore Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa. Miller-Meeks squeaked out a victory in 2020 by just six votes. But Miller-Meeks won by seven points in 2022. Democrats would be fortunate to knock off either Nunn or Miller-Meeks. But they definitely believe Bohannan has a bona fide shot at toppling Miller-Meeks.\nIn Colorado, Rep. Yadira Caraveo D-Colo., won her first term by about 2,000 votes. She\u2019s up against Republican challenger Gabe Evans. But it\u2019s believed a strong showing at the top of the ticket in blue Colorado could help Caraveo.\nTRUMP ALLY TIM SCOTT MULLS BID FOR TOP ROLE AT SENATE CAMPAIGN ARM\nIn New Mexico, Freshman Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-N.M. is in a rematch with former Rep. Yvette Harrell, R-N.M. This district is one of the swingiest in the country and bears watching. Former Rep. Xochitl Torres Small, D-N.M.,flipped this districtin 2018 after former Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., ran for governor. Harrell then defeated Torres Small in 2020. However, Vasquez flipped the district back to the Democrats in 2022. Harrell hopes to return the favor this fall.\nBesides New York, California is where Democrats also hope to make up significant ground. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the Democratic nominee for President used to represent the Golden State in the Senate and served as its attorney general. Moreover, a Senate race could boost Democratic turnout. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is running against former Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres star Steve Garvey.\nDemocrats hope to unseat Reps. John Duarte, R-Calif., David Valadao, R-Calif., Mike Garcia, R-Calif., Ken Calvert, R-Calif., and Michelle Steel, R-Calif. They each represent battleground districts. Duarte won his race in an upset last cycle by fewer than 600 votes. Democrats unseated Valadao in 2018. But he returned to Congress in 2020.\nAlso, three other races could indicate whether it\u2019s a Democratic or Republican night.\nIn Oregon, Freshman Rep. Lori Chavez-Deremer, R-Ore., runs against Democrat Janelle Bynum. Bynum has defeated Chavez-Deremer in previous contests for the statehouse. If Chavez-Deremer holds on, that could flash as a positive sign for the GOP.\nJanelle Bynum is a Democrat running for Congress in Oregon.(Janelle Bynum for Congress)\nMeantime, Freshman Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash., was the biggest upset of the last election cycle. She eked out a victory over Republican Joe Kent by about 2,000 votes. Gluesenkamp Perez and Kent face off again. The district was Republican prior to last cycle. But it\u2019s believed Kent veered too far toward the right, courting former President Trump and pro-MAGA forces. This race could be a bellwether to distill just how well the MAGA message resonates.\nFinally, control of the House could hinge on Alaska.\nRep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, won this at-large seat after Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska died in 2022. Young represented the state in the House for nearly half a century. However, Peltola has never been on the ballot at the same time as former President Trump. Mr. Trump defeated President Biden by ten points here in 2020.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIf Peltola prevails, that victory on solid GOP turf could go a long way toward Democrats flipping the House.\nBut, because so many of these races might be tight, it may be impossible to divine which party controls the House for a while.

Speaking to Fox News in an interview Monday, Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the campaign has been in contact with state and local election officials in the Southeast to survey the damage and ensure voters have access to the ballots.\nThe campaign leadership, she said \"has sent a letter \"to state and local officials on the ground in North Carolina saying, \u2018You need to provide as many accessible voting locations as possible on the ground,'\" Leavitt told Fox News, adding: \"Our campaign is reviewing how we can possibly provide transportation for voters who need to get to the polls and ensuring they have access to the ballot box.\"\nIn Florida, which was battered by both Hurricanes Helene and Milton, Gov.

IT'S ONLY GOTTEN WORSE\nWhat\u2019s the significance of that? Well, Election Day wasn\u2019t until November 3, 2020. Hence, while early voting was already underway in the weeks before the election, the FBI had already known for nearly a year that the laptop was the real deal.\nDespite that, the bureau induced major social media titans, such asTwitter (now X)and Facebook, to suppress derogatory reporting about the Bidens \u2013 specifically, the New York Post\u2019s mid-October 2020 reporting on the laptop. How? By deceptively intimating that the Post\u2019s reporting was likely the result of an influence operation carried out by Russian intelligence.\nIn reality, this was an influence operation carried out by current and former U.S. intelligence officials. TheFBI was not alone.\nThe government\u2019s \"Intelligence Community\" routinely shares information. The IC, too, is prone to hype Russian \"interference\" in U.S. elections. Yet, such \"influence operations\" are longstanding: Moscow interfered in American politics throughout the Cold War; it has continued to do so since the Soviet Union\u2019s fall up to the present day. Influence ops are also reciprocal: U.S. spy agencies routinely sought to influence Soviet politics and, now, seek to undermine Putin. If they didn\u2019t, what good would they be?\nFor all the heavy-breathing by themedia-Democrat complex, modern Russia is a basket-case country run by a mafia-style regime whose election-influence ops are often laughably amateurish. They are, moreover, a negligible ripple in the multi-billion-dollar ocean of American campaign messaging.\nHUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP RE-EMERGES AS MEDIA EMBARRASSMENT AS IT BECOMES KEY EVIDENCE AT GUN TRIAL\nAs our domestic security service specializing in foreign counterintelligence, the FBI is a critical IC component. The IC is led by the Office of the National Intelligence Director (ODNI), part of whose core mission is to ensure that intelligence is shared community-wide \u2013 including, of course, with the CIA, which combats foreign threats to American interests. If the FBI knew the laptop was authentic, not a product of Russian intelligence, so did the IC.\nIt was IC veterans, however, led by former officials who\u2019d served in the highest ranking posts in theObama-Biden CIAand ODNI, who generated the notorious election-eveletterin which 51 such officials endeavored to deceive voters into dismissing thePost\u2019s laptop reporting as bearing \"the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\" Indeed, we now know this letter was instigated at the suggestion ofAntony Blinken\u2013 then a Biden-Harris campaign adviser, now the Biden-Harris administration's secretary of state \u2013 and that the \"classic earmarks\" line was suggested by James Clapper, the Obama-Biden Director of National Intelligence.\nThat letter was dated October 19, 2020 \u2013 again, ten months after the FBI seized the laptop. Naturally,President Biden\u2013 who also had to know the laptop was authentic \u2013 used the former officials\u2019 letter and its politicization of their government national-security credentials in order to discredit then-President Trump\u2019s highlighting of the laptop and its damning contents at the final presidential debate.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIt doesn\u2019t take a quantum physicist to figure out what happened here. During the summer of 2020, asSen. Chuck Grassley, R., Iowa, hasrecounted, he and Sen. Ron Johnson, R., Wisc., were scrutinizing bank records and other evidence of huge payments to Biden family members (work that became the foundation for the eventual House impeachment investigation). Alarmed, Senate Democrats suddenly asked friendly FBI supervisors in Washington, D.C., to intervene with a briefing on the bureau\u2019s fears of Russian influence operations against the 2020 election.\nThere was no reason to believe readily verifiable bank records about suspicious foreign money transfers had been generated by Russian intelligence. Yet, theFBI collaborated with Democratsin framing it that way. The bureau produced an \"assessment\" about signs of foreign interference in the then-upcoming 2020 election, which Democrats used to portray Grassley and Johnson as dupes who were doing the Russians\u2019 bidding.

The 51 national security officials piled on with their letter, and Biden himself trumpeted the fraud at the debate.\nThe American people spend over $100 billion per year on the IC.

They don\u2019t care about me.\"\nKAMALA 2.0\u2019S CHALLENGE?

Woodward is an angry, little man and is clearly upset because President Trump is successfully suing him because of the unauthorized publishing of recordings he made previously. President Trump gave him absolutely no access for this trash book that either belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section of a discount bookstore or used as toilet tissue. Woodward is a total sleazebag who has lost it mentally, and he\u2019s slow, lethargic, incompetent and overall a boring person with no personality.\"\nWhy stop there?\nTrump, who prides himself on being a counter-puncher, wastes little time before swinging away.\nVice President Kamala Harris poses during the Unite for America live-streaming rally in Farmington Hills, Michigan, on Sept. 19, 2024.(SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)\nAfter Harris\u2019 friendly radio interview with Howard Stern, who said it would be insanity to vote for Trump, a post appeared on Truth Social.\n\"BETA MALE Howard Stern made a fool of himself on his low-rated radio show when he \u2018interviewed\u2019 Lyin\u2019 Kamala Harris, and hit her with so many SOFTBALL questions that even she was embarrassed.\n\"He looked like a real fool, working so hard to make a totally incompetent and ill-equipped person look as good as possible, which wasn\u2019t very good. I dropped Howard a long time ago, like most others, and have since been credited with very good judgment!\"\nTrump and Stern were, of course, once New York pals, and Trump attended his wedding.\nTrump also had campaign manager Chris LaCivita take a swipe at Fox News for covering (along with other networks) a government briefing, featuring both Biden and Harris, on Hurricane Milton as the monster storm was heading toward Florida.\n\"@FoxNews \u2069just as bad as every other \u2018cable news\u2019 network \u2026running literally propaganda and @KamalaHarris \u2069TV ads disguised as a news conference,\" Chris LaCivita posted on X.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOf course, there\u2019s a political benefit for Harris showing that she and FEMA are working hard to prepare for the Florida storm, just as there is when Florida Gov.

MAKING MORE NEWS, AND NOT JUST WITH ULTRA-FRIENDLY HOSTS\nI know, they\u2019re not straight journalists, they\u2019re liberal commentators slash entertainers. They read their questions verbatim off blue cards. That\u2019s precisely why she wanted to do the show.\nThere were some reasonable questions: How would her presidency differ from Joe Biden\u2019s? How would she handle the border? Why wouldn\u2019t Ron DeSantis take her callsabout hurricane preparationswith a Category 4 storm about to hit Florida?\nAnd then there was Joy Behar, who went on about Trump\u2019s lies and asked how anyone could possibly support him. That enabled the Vice President to say Trump was all about personal grievances, not the voters.\nVice President Kamala Harris appeared on Tuesday's episode of \"The View.\"(ABC)\nKamala made good use of the forum, such as dishing on how she was working out and with her kids when Joe Biden called to say he was stepping aside.\nBottom line: \"The View,\" an ABC program founded by Barbara Walters \u2013 it\u2019s still in the news division \u2013 was even more embarrassing than I expected, with the ladies falling all over themselves to praise Harris and trash Trump.\nSome reasonable questions were asked, but Kamala ran circles around them and deflected what she didn't want to answer while getting her familiar talking points in.\nIt was a good forum for her, and for once she came prepared to make news. In a move earlier leaked to Politico, Harrismade her pitchfor having Medicare reimburse caring for the elderly at home instead of only in expensive institutions \u2013 the first new policy proposal she's made in weeks. She said she would pay for it by demanding deeper discounts on certain drugs paid for by Medicare. Needless to say, she was not exactly cross-examined on the subject.\nWALZ-HARRIS WILL BE THE MOST \u2018RADICAL\u2019 ELECTED OFFICIALS THE WORLD HAS SEEN: COREY LEWANDOWSKI\nThe ladies seemed awed that Kamala Harris was even there.\nIt was a very different Kamala who appeared on a \"60 Minutes\" prime-time special aired the night before.\nTo be sure, the news magazine show repeated some of her criticisms of Trump, with Bill Whitaker saying: \"You have accused Donald Trump of using racist tropes when it comes to Haitian immigrants. In Springfield, Ohio. When it comes to birtherism, when it comes to Charlottesville, in fact, you have called him a racist and divisive, yet Donald Trump has the support of millions and millions of Americans.\"\nThe veep\u2019s talking-point response: \"I believe that the people of America want a leader who's not trying to divide us and demean.\"\nBut Whitaker was a bulldog when it came to asking for followups again and again when the Democratic nominee offered generalities.\nCBS News appears to have made a favorable edit to its \"60 Minutes\" interview with Vice President Kamala Harris.(Screenshot/CBS News)\nWhen asked about the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget saying her plan would add $3 trillion over the next decade \u2013 it was much higher for Trump \u2013 Harris talked about economists liking her plan and pivoted to praising small business.\nWhitaker\u2019s response: \"Pardon me, Madam Vice President. The question was, how are you going to pay for it?\"\nThis time, Harris said she\u2019d make sure billionaires and big corporations would have to pay their \"fair share,\" and Whitaker expressed skepticism that Congress would approve that.\nThis was the question that Harris hasn\u2019t really had to answer.\n\"Let me tell you what your critics and the columnists say, okay? They say that the reason so many voters don't know you is that you have changed your position on so many things,\" said Whitaker. \"You were against fracking. Now you're for it. You supported looser immigration policies, now you're tightening them up. You are forMedicare for All. Now you're not so many that people don't truly know what you believe or what you stand for.\"\n'60 MINUTES' DEFENDS HANDLING OF HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP COVERAGE AS IT HITS TRUMP FOR SKIPPING INTERVIEW\nHarris offered this answer: \"In the last four years I have been vice president, United States. And I have been traveling our country. And I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus.\" Translation: The world has changed and I have to be realistic about what I can get passed.\nThe interview was so heavily edited that you could see the changes several times as Harris magically limited her answers to two sentences. That\u2019s the overproduced \"60 Minutes\" style, but I think it was a mistake.CBS should haverun the whole thing, or a major chunk of it, unedited.\n(SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)\nScott Pelley said Trump had agreed to an interview but backed out with shifting explanations, including that there be no fact-checking.\nBy yesterday afternoon, Kamala was taping her interview with Howard Stern, who loved Trump back in the day when they were rating women and has been totally opposed to him as a candidate and president.\nReacting to Bob Woodward\u2019s forthcoming book saying Trump secretly sent Vladimir Putin a COVID test machine during the pandemic \u2013 which the former president denies \u2013 the VP said: \"I believe that Donald Trump has this desire to be a dictator. He admires strongmen and he gets played by them because he thinks that they\u2019re his friends and they are manipulating him full-time and manipulating him by flattery and with favor\u2026\n\"This guy who is President of the United States is sending them to Russia? To a murderous dictator for his personal use?\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nStern called it \"maddening\" and \"insanity\" that anyone would support Donald Trump. He told Harris he would vote for her, but could also vote for \"that wall over there\" over the ex-president.\nHarris is finally starting to make some news. Imagine if she\u2019d started some of these interviews weeks ago.\nHoward Kurtz is the host of FOX News Channel'sMediaBuzz(Sundays 11 a.m.-12 p.m. ET).\u00a0Based in Washington, D.C., he joined the network in July 2013 and regularly appears onSpecial Report with Bret Baierand other programs."}]
