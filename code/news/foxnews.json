These people should be put in jail the way they talk about our judges and our justices,\" Trump collectively stated in some of the television clips played.\nIn recent comments on the matter toFox Business'Maria Bartiromo, Trump spoke about such \"enemies,\" and quipped that while China and Russia are \"dangerous\" at times to deal with, \"the thing that's tougher to handle are these lunatics that we have inside like Adam Schiff.\"\nMAHER SAYS HE'S NOT WORRIED ABOUT 'CRAZY' TRUMP WINNING ELECTION: \u2018NOT EVEN NERVOUS'\nDemocratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally at the Williams Arena at Minges Coliseum on the campus of East Carolina University on October 13, 2024, in Greenville, North Carolina.(Alex Wong/Getty Images)\nSchiff, a congressman from Burbank, Calif., is currently the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate against Republican retired MLB star Steve Garvey.\nDuring an interview on \"CNN News Central,\" Berman asked Waltz whether it was \"responsible\" for Trump to make such comments.\nWaltz claimed that Trump was talking about issues that are \"detrimental\" to democracy in the United States and undermine public trust in institutions. For example, he claimed that Schiff, a senior House Intelligence Committee member, leaked information from compartmented hearings and lied to the public in open hearings.\nBerman then referenced the \"lunatic\" comment directed at Schiff and suggested that Trump was also talking about dealing with \"lunatics\" in a hypothetical military deployment.\n\"John, people were on this network calling Trump Hitler and the next coming of another dictator and two people have tried to kill him. We have the Iranians trying to kill him. A foreign adversary trying to assassinate him and we're talking about him playing music in a rally,\" Waltz said.\nBerman acknowledged that while it is essential to talk about heated rhetoric directed at Trump, Waltz himself has suggested that Harris is a \"socialist.\"\nAS A CAUTIOUS KAMALA LOSES MOMENTUM, DEMOCRATS ARE PANICKING OVER A TRUMP WIN\nCNN's John Berman and Rep.

Waltz also contended that such language is radicalizing people to take action.\nHe also noted that some members of Congress have referred to themselves as \"democratic socialists\" and insisted that Berman was not making a \"fair comparison.\"\n\"You don't?\" Berman asked. \"You talk about Marxism.

Always hover over links or check the domain carefully. In the case of \"all-vote.com,\" if it's not a well-known or official site (like .gov for U.S. voting), it's worth being suspicious.\n3) Grammatical errors: Many scam messages contain typos, awkward phrasing or grammatical mistakes. This can be a red flag for phishing or scam attempts.\n4) Requests for personal information: Legitimate organizations typically don\u2019t ask for sensitive information like Social Security numbers, bank details or passwords via text. Scams often do.\n5) Have strong antivirus software:The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious texts, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

You really face a potentially imminent invasion.\"\nRather than softening him, the meeting appeared to put Ukraine's president even more on the defensive.\nAs Woodward writes,\u00a0Zelenskyy was hard-pressed to acknowledge the imminence of the invasion despite credible U.S. intelligence, in large part because it would create a \"self-fulling prophecy\" for Ukraine's nascent democracy, risking the collapse of the country's economy, and potentially, its government.\nFinally, Zelenskyy relented, looking Harris in the eye and asking directly, \"What do you want me to do?\"\nHe inquired whether the U.S. would impose sanctions, close ports to Russian ships, give Ukraine Stinger or Javelin missiles or send warplanes to his country, in order to equip them for the battles ahead.\nHarris\u2019s answer did little to assuage him. \"The punishment can only come after the crime,\" she said of a U.S. response to Russia, Woodward noted, instead advising him to \"start thinking about things like having a succession plan in place to run the country if you're captured or killed or cannot govern.\"\nZelenskyy was urged by the U.S. to have an escape plan \u2013 one which he boldly rebuffed, choosing to remain in Kyiv in the days and weeks following Russia\u2019s invasion.\nHe also turned down evacuation offers from both the U.S. and Turkey following the start of the war.\nThe \"fight is here,\" he would later say from Kyiv. \"I need ammunition, not a ride.\"\nBIDEN PLEDGES $8 BILLION TO UKRAINE FOLLOWING PUTIN'S PROPOSED CHANGES TO NUCLEAR RULES\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks to reporters in front of a Patriot air defense missile system.(Jens Buettner/dpa via AP)\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHarris remarked to Gordon upon leaving the meeting that that was the last time they might ever see him again.\n\"War\" is available for purchase in stores on Oct. 15.\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.\nBreanne Deppisch is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering the 2024 election and other national news."}, {"source": "foxnews", "title": "Fox News Politics: Nathan Wade grilled", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-politics-nathan-wade-grilled-house-investigators", "content": "Welcome to the Fox News\u2019 Politics newsletter, with the latest political news from Washington, D.C. and updates from the\u00a02024 campaign trail.\nHere's what's happening\u2026\n-Trump says 'I don't care when you vote' in newHouse GOPad urging voters to turn out early\n-Top outside group backingSenate Republicansshowcases fundraising haul\n-Harris holds big advantage among early voters, Trump with Election Day voters:poll\nFormer Fulton County Special Prosecutor Nathan Wade left Capitol Hill on Tuesday after a marathon four-and-a-half hour grilling by House Judiciary Committee investigators.\nWade, whose legal team included former Georgia Gov.

There\u2019s no question that many Democrats, who grew accustomed to reading stories about who\u2019ll be in the Harris Cabinet, are panicking.\nNow you could look at the glass as half-full and say it\u2019s remarkable that a relatively unpopular vice president, in a short period of time, is running neck and neck withDonald Trump.She is tied nationally in a new NBC College poll. But that\u2019s a drop of five points for Harris since the last survey in September.\nTrump is the ultimate Teflon candidate. The press may jump on him for refusing to release his medical records (as Harris just did) but demanding she take a cognitive test; for using incendiary language against illegal immigrants, or for vowing to protect women when it\u2019s his Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe.\nNOW THAT KAMALA HARRIS IS DOING INTERVIEWS, PEOPLE ARE REMINDED THEY \u2018DON\u2019T LIKE HER\u2019: LISA BOOTHE\nThe Harris campaign's hype train appears to be screeching to a grinding halt \u2013 and regardless of whether they'll admit it, Democratic intelligentsia are taking notice.(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. MAGA loyalists can\u2019t stand the media, and they\u2019re not going to change their minds at this late date. He has the advantage of having held the job. They remember Trump\u2019s presidency with growing fondness, particularly for a strong economy and greater limits at the border, and brush aside any negative developments, especially Jan. 6.\nHarris has certainly made policy proposals and done a bunch of softball interviews. But she made a big mistake on \"The View,\" saying she couldn\u2019t think of a single thing where she\u2019d differ fromJoe Biden.It was not intended as a gotcha question.\nHow can she grab the mantle of the change candidate and, with that sentence, cast herself as Biden 2.0?\nKAMALA 2.0\u2019S CHALLENGE? MAKING MORE NEWS, AND NOT JUST WITH ULTRA-FRIENDLY HOSTS\nIf she feels loyalty to Joe, it\u2019s misguided. As a veteran pol, he would understand if she said he did a good job but here\u2019s several areas where I disagree with him and would do things differently\u2013no word salad allowed.\nAxios and others are reporting tension between the Harris and Biden camps \u2013 she\u2019s replaced the president\u2019s top strategists and spokesmen \u2013 precisely the kind of leaks that mark a sputtering campaign.\nWhen people complain that they don\u2019t really know Kamala, they\u2019re really saying they\u2019re not yet prepared to trust her with the nuclear codes. She still has to pass the commander-in-chief test. But she also has to seem warm and approachable. That\u2019s a daunting challenge in a country that, unlike much of the world, has never elected a female president.\nKamala Harris' last-minute media blitz would be better spent on enemy territory than on cracking beers open with Stephen Colbert.(Screenshot/CBS)\nHere\u2019s someBritish invectivefrom Andrew Sullivanon his Substack:\n\"The more I listened to her in these interviews, the more worried I became that she doesn\u2019t actually believe in anything\u2026\n\"Her team either fears or knows she may not be up to it. And this is bleeding obvious. A presidential campaign where you rarely face the press, never deal with a hostile interview, and never hold a presser is a campaign defined by fear. You can smell it from miles away.\"\nAndrew, by the way, is voting for Harris, mainly because he\u2019ll do anything to keep Trump out of theWhite House.\nKamala keeps talking about being the underdog, but she\u2019s run a very cautious campaign. The anxiety about making a mistake should be outweighed by the need to make news, at a time when Trump is back to dominating the news. Many days go by in which she\u2019s a minor TV presence compared to the ratings-boosting Trump.\nIt\u2019s smart that she\u2019s now agreed to several network town halls, but she should have been doing these from the start, rather than reciting the same stump speech at rallies. Drinking beer with Stephen Colbert doesn\u2019t quite cut it.\nWHY VANCE EASILY BEAT WALZ IN DEBATE, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE IN THE PROCESS\nAnd who would have thought that the woman of color would be lagging behind the usual Democratic margins among Blacks \u2013 particularly Black men \u2013and Latinos?\nThings reached the point where Barack Obama had to scold Black men for sexism, accusing them of not being comfortable with voting for a woman.\nThe battleground polls are tight, so obviously Harris can still win. But she basically needs to camp outin Pennsylvania,Michigan and Wisconsin rather than trying to pick off these Sunbelt states.\nThe Harris campaign, if it hopes to take things all the way, needs to remain laser-focused on campaigning in the Rust Belt \u2013 rather than the usually-competitive Sun Belt, states that former President Trump seems poised to easily run away with.(AP Photo/David Yeazell)\nIn fact, if she had put aside any personal friction and picked Josh Shapiro, she\u2019d probably have more of an edge in his state. Instead, she went withTim Walz,who\u2019s not helping the ticket much no matter how many pheasants he hunts. He has, however, done well in two straight interviews with \"Fox News Sunday.\"\nA major step forward: Harris agreeing yesterday to an interview with Fox anchor Bret Baier, on Wednesday in Pennsylvania. Some headlines are calling this a risky move, but Bret has vast experience with such interviews and will absolutely be fair. The upside for her: reaching the largest audience by far in cable news.\nBret said on the air that he believes there\u2019s \"a sense that they have inside the campaign, their strategy has to change, they\u2019ve got to change. They\u2019re losing Black males\u2026 I think that the campaign realizes they have to do more outreach.\"\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\nMaybe this is all too much to lay on Kamala\u2019s shoulders.

Woodward is an angry, little man and is clearly upset because President Trump is successfully suing him because of the unauthorized publishing of recordings he made previously. President Trump gave him absolutely no access for this trash book that either belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section of a discount bookstore or used as toilet tissue.
