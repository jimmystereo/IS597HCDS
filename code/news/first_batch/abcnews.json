Matt Gaetz does not intend to return to Congressafter he withdrew from consideration to be President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general, it appears his seat will be vacant for months -- presenting a challenge for House Republicans who already maintain a slim majority in the incoming Congress.\nOn Friday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis set the FL-01 special election primary for Jan. 28 and the general election for April 1. That means Gaetz's seat will be unfilled for at least 12 weeks in the 119th Congress.\n\"At Gov. Ron DeSantis' direction, this special election is being conducted as quickly as statutorily possible,\" said Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd on Friday. \"We are committed to ensuring this election is held as soon as we are allowed to hold it by state law.\"\nSuch a vacancy would cut into the narrow majority House Republicans are projected to have in the next Congress, which will only continue to shrink if GOP Reps. Elise Stefanik and Michael Waltz are confirmed to be in Trump's Cabinet.\nABC News projects that Republicans have won 219 seats and Democrats 213 in the House. The numbers do not take into account any departures for jobs in the Trump administration or Gaetz's resignation. There are also three outstanding House races that still haven't been called, which will determine the ultimate size of the GOP's majority.\nThe special election schedule is at the Florida governor's discretion. For instance, the dates set by DeSantis in 2022 to fill the vacancy of the late Democratic Rep. Alcee Hastings left the seat open for nine months, despite Democrats' pushing for a speedier process.\nAt least half a dozen Florida Republicans have already expressed willingness to run for Gaetz's seat. 538 rates Florida's 1st Congressional District, which Gaetz represented for eight years, as \"solid Republican.\"\nGaetz on Friday sat for his first interview with conservative commentator Charlie Kirk since withdrawing as Trump's attorney general pick. During the interview, the conservative firebrand announced then that he would not return to Congress, despite having won reelection in November by 32 points.\n\"I'm going to be fighting for President Trump. I'm going to be doing whatever he asks of me, as I always have,\" Gaetz said. \"But I think that eight years is probably enough time in the United States Congress.\"\nABC News' Jay O'Brien contributed to this report.\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"}, {"source": "abcnews", "title": "Sens.

She's remained in Trump's orbit since then, continuing to advise him on legal matters.\nDespite the shake-up, Bondi seems easily positioned to pick up the mantle on Trump's goal of overhauling the Justice Department and his pledge for retribution against political opponents.\n\"For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans - Not anymore,\" Trump wrote in his official announcement of Bondi for attorney general. \"Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again.\"\nIn August 2023, during an appearance on Fox News, Bondi railed against the criminal indictments against Trump and what Fox host Sean Hannity described as a \"two-tiered system of justice.\"\n\"When Republicans take back the White House, and we will be back in there in 18 months or less, you know what's going to happen? The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted -- the bad ones -- the investigators will be investigated,\" she said.\n\"Because the deep state last term for President Trump, they were hiding in the shadows,\" Bondi continued. \"But now, they have a spotlight on them and they can all be investigated \u2026 We can clean house next term and that's what has to happen.\"\nShe also implied action could be taken against President Joe Biden amidRepublican allegationsthat Biden was personally involved in and benefited from his family's overseas business dealings, which have yet to be supported by direct evidence.\n\"When we have a new administration, absolutely, Sean. It has to,\" Bondi said at the time.\nThe comments echo Trump's ownvows on the campaign trailto go after his perceived political enemies, intelligence officers, prosecutors and more.\nTrump in 2016 led chants of \"lock her up\" against Hillary Clinton, though he never went after her legally once in office. Bondi, at the 2016 convention, when the crowd shouted \"Lock her up,\" responded: \"'Lock her up,' I love that.\"\nBondi was also a supporter of Trump's false claims regarding the 2020 election, helping file several unsuccessful lawsuits alleging voter fraud.\nShe appeared alongsideRudy Giulianiin Philadelphia the day after the 2020 race declaring Trump \"won Pennsylvania\" while votes were still being counted.

Pecker agrees to help with Trump's campaign by looking out for negative stories about him to \"catch and kill,\" according to prosecutors' statement of facts. He also agrees to publish negative stories about Trump's competitors in the election, according to the statement of facts filed by the Manhattan DA.\nPecker learns that a former Trump Tower doorman was trying to sell information that Trump allegedly fathered a child out of wedlock, according to the statement of facts. At the CEO's direction, AMI negotiates and signs an agreement to pay the doorman $30,000 in exchange for acquiring exclusive rights to the story. AMI allegedly falsely characterized this payment in its general ledger, according to the statement of facts.\nAMI purchases the story without fully investigating the doorman's claims, at the direction of Pecker, per his alleged arrangement with Trump, according to the statement of facts. AMI later determines the story was not true and wanted to release the doorman from the agreement, but Lawyer A -- a Trump Organization lawyer believed to be Michael Cohen -- allegedly instructs him not to do so until after the presidential election, according to the statement of facts.\nThe National Enquirer's editor-in-chief and chief content officer contacted Cohen (Lawyer A) about a woman -- who is believed to be Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who alleged she had had a sexual relationship with Trump while he was married, according to the statement of facts. Cohen (Lawyer A) is updated by the National Enquirer about this regularly over text and by phone, according to the statement of facts. Trump allegedly did not want this information to become public because he was concerned what impact it may have on his campaign for president, according to the statement of facts.\nAMI ultimately pays the woman $150,000 in exchange for her not speaking out on the alleged sexual relationship. She would also get two magazine cover features and a series of articles published under her byline, according to the statement of facts.\nProsecutors allege that this deal was made based on the understanding that Trump or the Trump Organization would reimburse AMI for the payment, according to the statement of facts.\nTrump has denied having the affair.\nAn audio recording allegedly captures a conversation between Trump and Cohen (Lawyer A) as they discuss how to obtain the rights to the woman's story from AMI and reimburse it for the payment, according to the statement of facts.\nCohen (Lawyer A) allegedly tells Trump he will open a company for the transfer of the woman's account and said he had spoken to Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg about setting it up, according to the statement of facts.\nA shell company -- called Resolution Consultants, LLC -- is allegedly set up on about Sept. 30, 2016. On or about that date, Pecker signs an agreement transferring the rights of the woman's account to the shell company owned by Cohen (Lawyer A) for $125,000, according to court documents. But, before the reimbursement was made, Pecker consulted AMI's general counsel and then told Cohen (Lawyer A) that the deal was off.\nNews breaks that Trump was caught on tape in 2005 telling the host of the entertainment show \"Access Hollywood,\" \"I just start kissing them\u00a0[women].\u00a0It's\u00a0like a\u00a0magnet.\u00a0Just kiss.\u00a0I\u00a0don't even\u00a0wait.\u00a0And when\u00a0you're a\u00a0star, they let\u00a0you do it.\u00a0You can\u00a0do anything. ...\u00a0Grab 'em\u00a0by the [genitals].\u00a0You can do\u00a0anything.\"\nAccording to prosecutors, evidence shows that both Trump and his campaign staff were concerned the tape would harm his viability as a candidate and reduce his standing with female voters in particular.\nIn a statement Trump releasedafter the recording was leaked, he apologized and called his remarks \"locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago.\"\nAMI's editor-in-chief contacts Pecker about a second woman -- believed to be adult film actress Stormy Daniels -- who alleged she had a sexual encounter with Trump while he was married, according to the statement of facts. Pecker tells the editor-in-chief to notify Cohen (Lawyer A).\nThe AMI editor-in-chief connects Cohen (Lawyer A) with the woman's lawyer. The two then negotiate a deal to secure the woman's silence. The woman would be paid $130,000 for the rights to her story, according to the statement of facts.\nTrump allegedly tells Cohen (Lawyer A) to delay making a payment to the second woman for as long as possible, according to prosecutors. If he is able to delay making the payment until after the election, they could avoid paying altogether, Trump allegedly says, per prosecutors. Prosectors claim emails and text messages between both lawyers and the AMI editor-in-chief show they attempted to delay making the payment for as long as possible, according to the statement of facts.\nUltimately, Trump agrees to the payoff and directs Cohen (Lawyer A) to proceed, prosecutors allege. Trump allegedly does not want to make the payment himself and asked Cohen (Lawyer A) and Weisselberg to find a way to make the payment, according to the statement of facts. Cohen (Lawyer A) makes the payment after confirming that Trump would pay him back.\nShortly after speaking with Trump over the phone, Cohen (Lawyer A) opens a bank account in Manhattan in the name of a shell company he had created to effectuate the payment, according to the statement of facts.\nCohen (Lawyer A) then transfers $131,000 from his personal home equity line of credit into the account, according to court documents.\nCohen (Lawyer A) transfers $130,000 to a lawyer representing the second woman accusing Trump of having a sexual encounter with her while he was married to suppress her story, according to court documents.\nTrump wins the presidential election.\nAMI then releases the doorman and the first accuser of their nondisclosure agreements, according to court documents.\nProsecutors allege that between Election Day and Inauguration Day, Trump meets privately with Pecker in Trump Tower in Manhattan, thanking him for handling the stories of the doorman and the first woman, according to the statement of facts.\nTrump invites Pecker to the inauguration, according to the statement of facts.\nTrump arranges to reimburse Cohen (Lawyer A) for the payoff he made on his behalf shortly after being elected president, according to the statement of facts.\nCohen (Lawyer A) meets with Weisselberg to discus how he would be reimbursed, with Weisselberg asking Cohen to bring a copy of a bank statement for the shell company account showing the $130,000 payment, according to the statement of facts.\nWeisselberg and Cohen (Lawyer A) agree to a total repayment amount of $420,000. That figure reflected double the $130,000 payment and $50,000 reimbursement for another expense in addition to a $60,000 year-end bonus -- so Cohen (Lawyer A) could characterize the payment as income on his tax returns instead of a reimbursement -- according to the statement of facts.\nTrump, Weisselberg and Cohen (Lawyer A) agree the lawyer would be paid the $420,000 through 12 monthly payments of $35,000 over the course of 2017, according to court documents. Cohen (Lawyer A) was to send an invoice to the Trump Org each month falsely requesting a payment of $35,000 for legal services rendered. Cohen (Lawyer A) does not have a retainer agreement with Trump or the Trump Organization, according to prosecutors.\nCohen (Lawyer A) meets with Trump in the Oval Office to confirm the repayment arrangement in February 2017, according to the statement of facts.\nCohen (Lawyer A) emails the Trump Organization the first monthly invoice requesting two $35,000 payments for January and February, which were allegedly approved by Weisselberg, according to the statement of facts.\nCohen (Lawyer A) submits 10 similar invoices for the remaining months in 2017, but is not on retainer, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors allege the Trump Organization falsely recorded each payment as a \"legal expense,\" according to the statement of facts.\nAccording to prosecutors, the first check was paid from Trump's trust and signed by Weisselberg and Trump's son, as trustees. It was falsely recorded as payments for January and February 2017 legal services, according to the statement of facts.\nA second check, for March 2017, was also paid from the trust and signed by two trustees, according to the statement of facts.\nThe remaining nine checks, for April through December 2017, were paid by Trump personally, according to the statement of facts. Trump allegedly signed each of the checks personally and had them sent to the Trump Organization in New York. They were then scanned and maintained in its data system before being detached and mailed to Cohen (Lawyer A), according to the statement of facts.\nThe last $35,000 payment made was for December 2017, according to the statement of facts.\nTrump invites Pecker to the White House for dinner to thank him for his help during the campaign, according to the statement of facts.\nThe FBIexecutes a search warrant on Cohen's residences and office, according to a statement of facts. Prosecutors allege that in the months that followed, Trump and others engaged in a public and private pressure campaign to try to ensure that Cohen did not cooperate with law enforcement in the federal investigation.\nCohen (Lawyer A) speaks with Trump on the day of the FBI searches, according to prosecutors. Trump allegedly told him to \"stay strong,\" according to the statement of facts.\nTrump publicly encourages Cohen not to \"flip\" in aseries of tweetssaying, \"Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't see Michael doing that.\"\nCohen (Lawyer A) is approached by an attorney -- Lawyer C -- who offers to represent him in the interest of maintaining a \"back channel of communication\" to Trump, according to the statement of facts.\nOn April 21, 2018, Lawyer C allegedly emails Cohen (Lawyer A) stating that he has a close relationship with Trump's personal attorney, named as Lawyer D, according to the statement of facts.\nLawyer C emails Cohen (Lawyer A) a news clip discussing the possibility of him cooperating with law enforcement, encouraging him not to, according to the statement of facts.\n\"The whole objective of this\u00a0exercise by the [federal prosecutors] is to drain you, emotionally and financially, until you reach a point that you see them as your only means to salvation,\" Lawyer C wrote in the email, according to the statement of facts.\nIn the same email, Lawyer C wrote, \"You are making a\u00a0very big mistake if you believe\u00a0the stories\u00a0these 'journalists'\u00a0are writing about\u00a0you.\u00a0They want you to\u00a0cave.\u00a0They want you to fail.\u00a0They do not want\u00a0you to persevere\u00a0and succeed,\" according to the statement of facts.\nInan in-depth interviewthat airs on \"Good Morning America,\" his first since the FBI raided his office and homes in April, Cohen strongly signals his willingness to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York -- even if that puts Trump in jeopardy.\n\"My wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will,\" Cohen tells ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. \"I put family and country first.\"\nCohenpleads guilty in the federal investigationadmitting to his role in AMI's payoff to McDougal (Woman 1) to influence the election, according to the indictment, and saying in his plea that he had done so at Trump's direction.\nCohen also pleads guilty in connection with his payoff of Daniels to secure her silence, claiming it was done at Trump's direction, according to the statement of facts.\nTrump commentson Twittersaying, \"If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen!\"\nCohen and AMI admit guilt in connection with the payoffs made to the two women claiming Trump had extramarital relations with them, according to the statement of facts.\nAMI entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in connection to the payoff made to Woman 1, admitting it did not intend to publish a story at any time during the negotiation or acquisition of her story, the practice known as \"catch and kill,\" according to the statement of facts.\nAfter a bitter campaign for reelection, Trump goes head to head with Joe Biden on Election Day. Four days later,it's clear Trump has lostafter ABC News projects Pennsylvania for Biden.\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance announceshe will not seek reelectionafter 12 years in office, with the investigation into Trump still ongoing.

That's in contrast to steady-as-she-goes mantras and beefy r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in a government bureaucracy that voters believe has failed them, Republican operatives told ABC News.\nThe shifting vocabulary is just another example of Trump's ability to transform norms in Washington, but also of voter frustrations and a shifting electorate. And now, Democrats warned, targeting nominees' r\u00e9sum\u00e9s risks reinforcing the image that the party is unreceptive to the beliefs of everyday Americans about what ails the country.\n\"I'm not endorsing anyone, but the argument that this person isn't qualified to do X because he doesn't have the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or the establishment kiss of approval just reinforces that they don't get it,\" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va. \"Debating r\u00e9sum\u00e9s when most people distrust government plays right into Trump's favor.\"\n\"If you asked most American people, guess what they would say, 'What's the difference? It's not like they've been doing a great job beforehand, so now you're worried about this guy?'\" Kofinis added of would-be nominees' qualifications. \"The argument is, 'you need to have people with managerial and certain type of policy expertise to run these agencies.' Based on whose opinion? Based on experts' opinion, or based on the American people's opinion?\"\nTrump has moved at a rapid pace to flesh out his upcoming administration, handpicking an array of establishment and unconventional people for top posts.\nSen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mike Waltz, two Floridians, were deemed establishment picks for secretary of state and national security adviser, respectively.\nThe president-elect has also put forth Fox News host and Army veteran Pete Hegseth as his Pentagon chief, Linda McMahon to lead the Education Department, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii to be director of national intelligence. Former Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz was also pegged to be attorney general, though he took his name out of consideration on Thursday.\nNone has particularly brawny resumes on those departments' subject matter, which Democrats have repeatedly noted.\nTo be certain, resumes aren't the only issue at play. Gaetz and Hegseth are beset by sexual misconduct allegations, and Trump is still one to put a premium on loyalty as he sifts through is options for top administration posts. But Democrats have also worked to paint several of the picks as \"unqualified\" based on their relative lack of experience as well as by virtue of past personal issues and Trump's various policy pushes.\nThe question, though, is precisely what the word \"qualified\" means after an election in which voters registered their discontent with business as usual via their ballots.\n\"I think you can call some of these people outsiders, for sure. Others have experience, it's just not the experience that maybe the D.C. establishment is looking for. It's not somebody that worked their way up in this department and now is the person to do it. It's someone that's going to take a fresh look,\" said Nick Trainer, a GOP strategist and former Trump administration official.\n\"Americans that aren't tuned into their government every day are shifting towards the Republican Party, and it's because these elites in the D.C. establishment and the Democrat Party don't get it,\" Trainer added. \"They just don't understand that an average American in a Midwestern state or whatever doesn't care if their secretary of XYZ studied at Harvard. That's not what they want.\"\nThe new standard is being established with the help of Trump's unique sway among his base, offering him the ability to inject credibility into his picks solely by virtue of his imprimatur. And now, Democrats are forced to grapple with precisely how to respond.\nThe party is undergoing a post-election reckoning to understand how its brand became so unpalatable that Vice President Kamala Harris suffered a comprehensive defeat to a twice-impeached convicted felon. Tactical decisions over advertising, spending, media appearances and more have been cited as possible pitfalls for Harris.\nBut beyond tactics, Democrats lamented a reputation as elitist, inside-the-beltway experts with little knowledge or interest in what average Americans feel is important for the country. And going after cabinet candidates for lacking elite academic or government bureaucratic credentials risks exacerbating the issue.\n\"The dog whistle when it comes to how Democrats describe experience, is it means status quo,\" said Sean Spicer, Trump's first White House press secretary.\nSome Democrats said the likely nominees' past policy stances are ripe for criticism -- but that going after resumes could be risky.\n\"Anytime we are showing elitism or being preachy, it's not good for our brand. But if we're calling out folks who have turned their back on workers or people that have done things that are not in the best interest of America or other things, then I think those are distinct questions that help the party,\" said Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist who is mulling a run for Democratic National Committee chair.\n\"It's about not being with America, not being with the workers,\" Rocha added Wednesday. \"I would argue against Matt Gaetz, sure, the sex parties and the other stuff is crazy, but he's also had a long resume of voting against capping insulin and other things that have really been bad for American workers.\"\nOthers advocated more of a wait-and-see approach.\n\"If your angle of attack is, 'person X is grossly unqualified,' let them prove they're not qualified,\" Kofinis said. \"If you want to start earning trust back from the American people, stop being so quick to give an answer and conclusion, and wait.\"\nWhile Democrats are figuring out how to respond to Trump's picks and how to resurrect their brand more broadly, Republicans are satisfied to watch them twist in the wind.\n\"Democrats are the resistance party. They're going to find whatever excuse they can to resist,\" said one former Trump campaign official. \"So, I'm not surprised by that, but they're going to continue to hurt themselves, that's for sure. They're missing the point.\"\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"}, {"source": "abcnews", "title": "Tracking Trump's picks to serve in his Cabinet, administration", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tracking-trump-named-serve-cabinet-administration/story?id=115777302", "content": "Trump's choices include RFK Jr., Elon Musk, Matt Gaetz and more.\nPresident-electDonald Trump, ahead of his return to power in January, is announcing who he wants to fill Cabinet positions and other key roles inside his administration, including names like Marco Rubio, Tulsi Gabbard and Matt Gaetz.\nTrump began to roll out his nominees and appointees just days after his election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris.

Mike Rounds introduced the \"Returning Education Back to Our States Act\" on Thursday, signaling a commitment to deliver on President-elect Donald Trump's vow to dismantle the Department of Education.\nIn the conservative movement to return education back to local control, Rounds said the legislation would \"eliminate\" the department while redistributing all critical federal programs to other agencies.\nRounds' announcement was first reported by Fox News.\n\"For years, I've worked toward removing the federal Department of Education,\" the Republican senator wrote in a statement, adding \"I'm pleased that President-elect Trump shares this vision, and I'm excited to work with him and Republican majorities in the Senate and House to make this a reality. This legislation is a roadmap to eliminating the federal Department of Education by practically rehoming these federal programs in the departments where they belong, which will be critical as we move into next year.\"\nIn his statement, Rounds said the United States spends too much on education for students' test scores to be lagging behind other countries in standardized assessments. He called the DOE ineffective and earmarked the department's responsibilities for the Departments of Interior, Treasury, Health and Human Services, Labor and State, according to the bill text.\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and aid programs under Title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act will be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of Indian Education of the Department of Education will be transferred to the Department of the Interior, the Federal Pell Grant and other higher education loan programs will be transferred to the Department of the Treasury.\nAccording to the bill, the treasury department will allocate Block grants to states for K-12 and postsecondary education. The treasury secretary also has the power to withhold these funds if they are mishandled by the states. The Justice Department will oversee federal civil rights laws that were previously under Title VI.\nKentucky Rep.

Massie's bill wasn't voted on in the House last year.\nHowever, education analyst Neal McCluskey at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, argued Massie's one-sentence bill was not realistic.\n\"You've got to figure out what to do with all the legislation that feeds into the Department of Education,\" McCluskey said.\n\"If Congress were to pass that law that says, abolish the Department of Education, technically the department would go away, but then you'd have all sorts of questions, well, who's going to administrate or be administrator for all these programs,\" he said.\nIn March 2023, Massie wrote an amendment H.Amendment 124 in H.R. 5, the \"Parents Bill of Rights Act\" \u2013 the House's signature K-12 education policy \u2013 to abolish the department. That amendment failed as all Democrats and 60 House Republicans voted against it.\nEven as Republicans hold majorities in both chambers next Congress, the Senate typically needs 60 votes to do anything, according to McCluskey. McCluskey said, \"There's no chance they're going to be at 60, and so it's going to be tough [to abolish the department legislatively].\"\n\"The Department of Education administers a whole lot of laws, and then those laws have to be changed about who runs student aid and who is tasked with making decisions about canceling student debt, and who decides or who administers Title I and lots of these other federal programs,\" McCluskey told ABC News.\n\"He [President-elect Trump] can certainly use the bully pulpit to drive this a lot. He could provide legislative blueprints if he wanted to. But ultimately this has to come through Congress,\" McCluskey underscored.\nMeanwhile, Augustus Mays, vice president for partnerships and engagement at the advocacy group The Education Trust, told ABC News that the president-elect could also ask Congress to gut federal programs like Title 1, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), and others, in his congressional budget request.\nPublic education, particularly in high-need districts, would effectively be drained of millions of dollars, according to Mays.\n\"It would really cripple the ability to function and aid the support that these students need to really succeed from an academic standpoint,\" Mays said.\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"}, {"source": "abcnews", "title": "What to know about Trump AG pick Pam Bondi", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-announces-pam-bondi-new-attorney-general-pick/story?id=116115173", "content": "Trump chose the former Florida attorney general shortly after Gaetz withdrew.\nOn the same day that former Rep.

Matt Gaetz, President-elect Donald Trump's embattled pick for attorney general, amid opposition from Senate Republicans, marks the first major setback for Trump as he fills his Cabinet -- but other high-profile nominees also appear to be facingmounting pushbackfrom members of his own party.\nIn a recent episode of her SiriusXM radio show, Trump's former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, skewered Tulsi Gabbard, the president-elect's selection for director of national intelligence, and his choice for health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. -- blasting both nominees for their foreign policy ideologies.\nSpeaking about Gabbard, Haley said she had \"major issues\" with her being proposed and reiterated comments Gabbard has made in the past that she said run counter to the views of the U.S. intelligence community, including blaming NATO for the invasion of Ukraine and her decision to meet with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad in 2017.\n\"She has defended Russia, she has defended Syria, she has defended Iran, and she has defendedChina,\" Haley said. \"DNI has to analyze real threats. Are we comfortable with someone like that at the top of our national intelligence agencies?\"\nIn presenting her argument, Haley also emphasized various occasions in which Gabbard -- a former Democratic congresswoman who ran for the party's presidential nomination in 2020 before becoming a Republican -- has directly clashed with the president-elect.\n\"She opposed ending the Iran nuclear deal. She opposed sanctions on Iran. She opposed designating the Iran military as terrorists who say death to America every single day,\" Haley said. \"She said that Donald Trump turned the U.S. into Saudi Arabia's prostitute. This is going to be the future head of our national intelligence.\"\nHaley also referencedGabbard'sassertion in a 2020 interview that the Trump administration provided \"no justification whatsoever\" for authorizing the strike that killed Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, which Gabbard also described at the time as an \"illegal and unconstitutional act of war.\"\n\"She tried to limit Trump's war powers against Iran. She tried to cut our annual defense budget so that we couldn't punish Iran and hinder their influence,\" Haley said.\nSpeaking about Kennedy, Haley said he is \"not a health guy\" but a \"liberal Democrat\" who spent his time in Washington siding with progressive policies while also criticizing his views of U.S. adversaries.\n\"He said he would consider admitting Russia into NATO,\" Haley said, an apparent reference to Kennedy's contention that Moscow should have been admitted to the alliance following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\nHaley also denounced Kennedy's support for thawing relations with China, which she said could have deleterious implications for American healthcare.\n\"During COVID, we talked about how 90% of our medications were coming from China and how dependent we are. He wants us to deescalate tensions,\" she said.\nHaley was Trump's primary opponent in the content for the GOP's presidential nomination but endorsed him after dropping out of the race in March.\nAfter winning the White House, the president-elect publicly announced he would not invite Haley back to serve in his second administration. But Haley, at least outwardly, has maintained a cordial relationship with Trump and brushed off the snub, insisting she made it clear she had \"no interest in being in his Cabinet.\"\nSources tell ABC News that Gaetz bowed out of what was shaping up to be a futile confirmation battle on Thursday after it became clear to Trump's team that the former Florida lawmaker, who is facing sex trafficking and drug use allegations, had \"no path\" to securing 50 votes in the Republican-led Senate.\nWhile it's not clear that either Gabbard or Kennedy face similarly long odds in the chamber, both have been lambasted by Republicans in recent days.\nFormer Republican Rep. Joe Walsh slammed both candidates during an interview on Sunday.\n\"These people have no business running these departments,\" he said. \"This is like a revenge against Dr. Fauci when it comes to RFK Jr., but Tulsi Gabbard, the best you can say about her is she's a Putin cheerleader. That's the best you can say.\"\nGabbard has also attracted the ire of the \"Wall Street Journal's\" right-leaning editorial board, which said she has \"given no indication across her long political career that she is the right person\" to lead the intelligence community.\nThe Trump-friendly New York Post took aim at both Gabbard and Kennedy, calling the former congresswoman a \"dreadful\" pick and saying \"it's hard to see\" how Kennedy could lead the Department of Health and Human Services to \"practical solutions.\"\nDuring the confirmation process, Republicans are expected to press Kennedy, who switched his party affiliation from Democrat to independent in 2023, on a range of views \u2014 including his criticism of vaccines and history of supporting abortion rights.\nBut another controversial nominee, Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News co-host whom Trump has tapped to lead the Pentagon, appears to be gaining GOP support.\nRepublican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said Hegseth would be a \"perfect\" secretary of defense.\nHegseth has been accused of sexual assault in 2017, and new details about the allegation emerged on Wednesday when a police report on the incident was made public. He has denied all wrongdoing and was never charged with a crime.\nAfter Hegseth met with Republicans on Capitol Hill, several Republicans appeared poised to look past the accusations against him.\n\"Since no charges were brought by the authorities, we have only press reports,\" Sen.

And I do not intend to take the oath of office for the same office in the 119th Congress to pursue the position of Attorney General in the Trump administration.\"\nIf Gaetz changes his mind and alerts the House clerk that he intends to serve in the 119th Congress, then he could be sworn in since a special election to fill the expected vacancy has not yet been scheduled.\nThe rules of the House of Representatives mandates that at the beginning of the first session of Congress, members must make their presence known to occupy their seat. The rule reads: \"House Rules 2. (a): At the commencement of the first session of each Congress, the Clerk shall call the Members, Delegates and Resident Commissioner to order and proceed to record their presence by States in alphabetical order, either by call of the roll or by use of the electronic voting system.\"\nIf Gaetz or another member does not report to the Capitol to record their presence, that district's seat will be designated vacant.\nThe House rules have very few further specifics. ABC News has an inquiry out to the Office of the Clerk for additional guidance.\nAnd Florida's own election laws seem vague on the issue.\nFlorida elections official Paul Lux, the Okaloosa County Supervisor ofElections, which is within Gaetz's district, told ABC News that he anticipates that the primary for the special election to fill Gaetz's seat once he announced his plans to resign would likely be sometime in February, and the general election would likely be in April -- though he stressed nothing is final until the official dates come out of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' office.\nDeSantis, for his part, has yet to formally set a date for that special election.\nABC News has reached out to the Division of Elections in the Florida Department of State to inquire whether the language in Gaetz's letter triggers any sort of automatic vacancy or if there is anything within Florida law that bars him from returning to the 119th Congress. Some Republicans in the district have already declared their intent to run, though one candidate, Joel Rudman, said he would support Gaetz if he wanted to return to Congress.\nGaetz has not publicly said what he plans to do next.

Eric Massa, who resigned from the House in 2010 amid accusations he had groped members of his staff. Despite Massa's resignation, the Ethics Committeevoted to reauthorizeits investigation the following year.\nThe Ethics Committee was investigating allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift.\n\"No workplace would allow that information to be swept under the rug simply because someone resigned for office,\" Casten said. \"It matters for the integrity of the law, it matters for the integrity of this House and it matters for the respect that we expect the American people to give us that those of us entrusted with this job will uphold the United States as a land where all are treated equally under the law.\"\nOn Thursday, Cohenposted on Xthat the Ethics Committee will have another chance to release the report when it meets in December. \"I hope they'll do the right thing.

Gabbard refuted the allegations and sued Clinton for defamation, but later dropped her compliant.\nIn an interview with Fox News following her being named, Gabbard said that some of her former Democratic colleagues had reached out to her in what she hoped \"could be and should be an effort for us to work together.\"\n\"I'm actually pretty heartened,\" Gabbard said.\nIn a statement announcing he had tapped her to lead the intelligence community, Trump lauded what described as \"broad support in both Parties\" for Gabbard.\n\"I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength,\" Trump posted on his social media platform. \"Tulsi will make us all proud!\"\nIf Gabbard ultimately becomes the director of national intelligence, she will oversee 18 U.S. intelligence agencies and play a critical role in determining what material is including in the president's daily intelligence briefings.\nShe is expected to face a confirmation battle in the Senate, but some hawkish Republicans in the chamber have expressed tepid support for her nomination.\n\"While we have differences on foreign policy, I think she's extremely bright and capable,\" South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said in an X post on Wednesday.\nGabbard has taken other controversial stances on foreign policy matters. In 2017, she journeyed to Syria to meet with its authoritarian leader Bashar al-Assad, whose government has carried out numerous deadly attacks on Syrian civilians through the course of the country's civil war, according to the U.N.\nThe then-congresswoman said after meeting with al-Assad that he was not an enemy of the U.S. and opposed American intervention in the conflict.\nIn 2015, Gabbard also defended Russian airstrikes in Syria conducted at the request of the Assad regime, echoing Moscow's claim that the operation was focused on terrorist targets when in reality it focused on Syrian opposition strongholds.\nGabbard has taken a much softer approach to China than the president-elect, calling on Trump to end his trade war against Beijing in 2019 and expressing her opposition to the remilitarization of Japan, a response to the strategic challenge posed by China.\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"}, {"source": "abcnews", "title": "Project 2025 seeps into Trump administration despite attempts to distance himself", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-project-2025-administration/story?id=116019369", "content": "Trump has nominated several Project 2025 contributors to his team.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump distanced himself fromProject 2025on the campaign trail but has sincenominated several authors or contributorsfrom the controversial conservative presidential wishlist to his administration.\nTrump called the Project 2025 policy proposals -- which include restrictions on abortion pills, birth control pills and Medicare access, as well as eliminating a couple of federal agencies -- \"extreme, seriously extreme\" in a July 20 rally.\n\"I don't know anything about it.

Program, which brought WWE stars into schools to teach students messages about \"Respect, Education, Achievement and Leadership\" -- were examples of her past educational pursuits.\nHowever, McMahon had written on her board application that she had a degree in education, even though her degree from East Carolina University was in French, according tolocal reportsfrom that period. Her spokesman at the time called it an \"honest mistake\" in the Connecticut Post.\nRegardless, McMahon stepped down from her post on the Connecticut State Board of Education -- and her position as CEO of WWE -- shortly after, in 2010, to run for the U.S. Senate as a Republican.\nOn her 2010 campaign website, she signaled support for \"competition and choice through charter schools\" and \"secondary school reform\" -- a position that is reflected in her views today.\n\"I believe in local control. I am an advocate for choice through charter schools,\" her campaign website at the time stated.\nShe lost that race, as well as her second attempt in 2012.\nOther forays into education included her role as a member of the board of trustees for Sacred Heart University. She was on the board from January 2004 to February 2017. She returned after serving in Trumps first administration, in 2021.\nMcMahon also co-founded the conservative research group America First Policy Institute in April 2021, which says its mission is to \"provide sound research and carefully crafted policy recommendations to advance the America First agenda,\" according to a press release.\nDuring that time, McMahon vouched to expand Pell Grant access for short-term workforce training programs.\n\u201cThe country is facing a historic labor shortage, and a multiyear degree program is not necessary for many Americans to obtain high-paying, fulfilling careers,\" said McMahon.\nWhile announcing her as his choice as secretary of education, Trump said McMahon \"will fight tirelessly to expand 'Choice' to every State in America.\"\nThe nomination was criticized by the National Education Association, which argued that her \"only mission is to eliminate the Department of Education and take away taxpayer dollars from public schools, where 90% of students -- and 95% of students with disabilities -- learn, and give them to unaccountable and discriminatory private schools.\"\nAccording to his Agenda47 policy platform, Trump's top education priorities do include eliminating the Department of Education. They also include expanding school voucher programs and giving more power to parents in classrooms.\nSchool \"choice\" has been a key proponent of conservative education policy in recent years, aiming to expand \"education savings\" policies so that families can redirect public school funding toward private schools or homeschooling.\nArizona passed the country\u2019s first of such program in 2011, and at least eight other states have followed its lead: Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah and West Virginia.\nHowever, voters in three states -- Nebraska, Kentucky and Colorado -- rejected efforts to codify or expand this kind of program.\nAs head of the Department of Education, McMahon would oversee federal policies impacting millions of students in the U.S.\nFor example, the department investigates the handling of sexual misconduct allegations under Title IX.\nAt the same time, McMahon's nomination comes as she and her husband Vince, co-founders of WWE, are facing allegations that they created a culture of tolerating and fostering the alleged sexual abuse against underage \u201cring boys.\u201d\n\u201cLinda McMahon was in the thick of it, acting as Vince\u2019s wife, confidante, co-leader in running the business, and the leader in trying to conceal the sordid underbelly of WWE\u2019s sexual abuse culture,\u201d according tothe current lawsuit.\nABC News reached out to both Trump's and McMahon's teams for comment.\n\"This civil lawsuit based upon thirty-plus year-old allegations is filled with scurrilous lies, exaggerations, and misrepresentations,\" said McMahon's lawyer in a statement to ABC News. \"The matter at the time was investigated by company attorneys and the FBI, which found no grounds to continue the investigation.\"\n\"Ms. McMahon will vigorously defend against this baseless lawsuit and without doubt ultimately succeed,\" the statement continued.\nOn Wednesday, McMahon accepted the president-elect\u2019s nomination and said she is \"hopeful\" for Senate confirmation, which is a requirement of the role,in a post on X.\nMcMahon wrote, \u201cI look forward to working collaboratively with students -- educators -- parents and communities to strengthen our educational system; ensuring every child regardless of their demographics is prepared for a bright future.\"\nShe added: \"Thank you for this extraordinary opportunity.

Gaetz has long denied any wrongdoing related to the allegations investigated during the congressional and Justice Department probes.\nRepublican Sens. Josh Hawley, Lindsey Graham, Mike Lee, Marsha Blackburn, John Kennedy and John Cornyn met with Vance and Gaetz on Wednesday.\nThe former congressman said the meetings have \"been going great.\"\n\"Senators have been giving me a lot of good advice.

Graham told reporters that the meeting went well and that Gaetz deserves a fair nomination process.\n\"Here's what I told him, no rubber stamps and no lynch mob. I'm not going to be part of a process that leaks information that shouldn't be leaked,\" Graham said. \"I'm not going to legitimize the process to destroy the man because people don't like his politics. He will be held to account in the confirmation process. He deserves a chance to make his argument why he should be attorney general.\"\nHawley defended Gaetz's nomination.\n\"My intention is to vote for all the president's nominees,\" Hawley said. \"I think for my colleagues who are -- who have concerns about the Attorney General nominee, my message would be, well, let's have a hearing on this. You can ask whatever -- if you're a member of the committee, you can ask whatever question you want, give Gaetz the opportunity to answer questions, lay out his vision, answer concerns.\"\nHawley said Gaetz understands his job, if confirmed, is to \"serve at the pleasure of the president.\"\n\"You gotta remember that cabinet secretary is not an exercise in individuality. I mean, you're there to serve at the pleasure of the president. That's the job, and he has a sense of what the president wants to do in terms of prioritizing law enforcement, getting the department out of the business of political prosecutions. So he wants a chance to lay that out,\" Hawley said.\nDemocrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday to request the complete evidentiary file in the bureau's closed investigation into Gaetz. Included in the ask is a request for forms that memorialize interviews conducted as part of the investigation.\nThe Democrats argued in the letter that there is precedent for the FBI providing these sorts of documents to Congress, including instances when Republicans obtained these documents.\nAs Vance and Gaetz met with senators, Trump attempted to blame Democrats for the allegations launched against some of his controversial Cabinet picks.\n\"They dirty them up, they destroy them, and then they spit them out.

Under House rules, once a privileged resolution is introduced, the House must take it up within two legislative days. Republicans have the majority in the House and leadership will decide when the resolution is brought up for a vote. Republicans will attempt to block the effort but it's not yet clear how this could play out.\nThe Ethics Committee was investigating allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift.\nGaetz resigned from Congress last week after President-elect Donald Trump announced he planned to nominate Gaetz to be his attorney general. The Ethics Committee generally drops investigations of members if they leave office, but Republicans and Democrats have argued whether to break that precedent to allow the Senate to perform its role of vetting presidential nominations.\nEarlier Wednesday, the committee voted against releasing the report after multiple rounds of votes, a source told ABC News, with all Republicans on the committee voting against its release.\nRepublican Rep.

Gaetz then successfully led the charge to oust McCarthy as speaker.\nThis June, the committee announced it was still investigating whether Gaetz had \u201cengaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.\u201d\nBut it announced it would take \u201cno further action\u201d on the allegations that he may have shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe or improper gratuity.\nThe House Ethics Committee had nearly completed the inquiry before Gaetz abruptly resigned last week after Trump announced he had selected Gaetz as his attorney general nominee.\nThe committee generally drops investigations of House members if they leave office but Republicans and Democrats have argued whether a break in that precedent is necessary for the Senate to perform its constitutional duty to advise and consent to presidential nominations.\nWhile the clearest above-water path for the report\u2019s release is by agreeing to a majority vote by the Ethics Committee, there is also speculation that any single member could offer a privileged resolution on the House floor to force an up-or-down vote on its disclosure.\nEthics Committee Chairman Michael Guest, R-Miss, has been tight-lipped about the meeting agenda on Wednesday but said he has read the Gaetz report.\nWild told reporters on Monday that the report should be disclosed to the public and said Wednesday that her position had not changed.\n\u201cYou either are going to disclose it or you're not going to disclose it.

At a White House ceremony in the spring, Bidenawarded the honor to 19 Americans, including former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, former Vice President Al Gore, Olympic swimmer Katie Ledecky and Oscar-winning actress Michelle Yeoh.\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"}, {"source": "abcnews", "title": "Pentagon chief Austin makes impassioned defense of women in combat", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-chief-lloyd-austin-makes-impassioned-defense-women/story?id=116058146", "content": "The comments follow Trump tapping Pete Hegseth to lead the DOD.\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin gave an impassioned defense of women in combat on Tuesday following Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Defense, arguing that the United States \"should not have women in combat roles.\"\n\"I don't know the potential nominee, so I can't comment on and won't comment on anything that he said,\" Austin, who was asked about the comments made by Hegseth on women in combat roles, said while in Laos to participate in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' Defense Ministers Meeting. \"I don't know what his experiences are, but I can tell you about my experiences with women in the military and women in combat, and they're pretty good.\"\nAustin's comments are the strongest statement from the military since Hegseth, an Army veteran who did tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was tapped by Trump tolead the DOD.\nTheFox News host has saidhis concerns are with women specifically in ground combat positions, not with pilots or those in other military roles, because he claims they have led to the military's physical standards being lowered and changed capabilities of combat units.\n\"I'm OK with the idea that you maintain the standards where they are for everybody. And if there's some ... hard-charging female that meets that standard, great, cool, join the infantry battalion,\" Hegseth said during a podcast appearance days before his nomination. \"But that is not what's happened. What has happened is the standards have lowered.\"\nSpeaking on his experience in his tours, Austin said, \"Every place I went, there were women doing incredible things, and they were adding value to to the overall effort, whether they were pilots, whether they were operational experts, whether they were intel experts. You know, I see things differently and I see that because of my experience, and that experience is extensive. And so, I think our women add significant value to the United States military, and we should never change that.\"\n\"And if I had a message ... to our women, I would say I would tell them that you know we need you. We have faith in you. We are appreciative of your service, and you add value to the finest and most lethal fighting force on earth,\" he said.\nOf the active-duty military personnel, 17.5% are women, and women make up 21.6% of the selected reserve, according to thePentagon's latest statistics.\n\"I love women service members, who contribute amazingly,\" Hegseth saidduring the podcast appearanceearlier this month. But three minutes later, he added, \"I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.\"\nHegseth's selection has drawn controversy as some service members express concerns about their futures in the military. Women began being able to be in ground combat units in 2013 after then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta rescinded a ban on women in these roles. Over 2,500 women serve in previously closed ground combat jobs, ABC Newspreviously reported.\nPanetta has come out in opposition to Hegseth's position on women in combat roles.\n\"Those kinds of comments come from a past era, and I think it's important for him to take the time to really look at how our military is performing in an outstanding fashion,\" Panetta told ABC News. \"We've got the best military in the world, and the reason is because we have the best fighting men and women in the world who are part of it.\"\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"}, {"source": "abcnews", "title": "Trump promised to disrupt Washington.

Others worry it'll be burned to the ground.\nSome say it's hardly a surprise.\nPresident-electDonald Trumpcampaigned relentlessly on a radical overhaul of the federal government.\nHis Cabinet picks, being unveiled at a breakneck pace, reflect he's determined to keep the promises he made to millions of Americans who voted to put him back in the White House.\n\"I don't think he's been very nuanced about it,\" Ty Cobb, a former Trump White House lawyer, told ABC News. \"Trump has been consistently saying that he's going to shake it up, that he's going to dismantle the Department of Education, that he's going to blow up the DOJ. All of these things are real.\"\nAt first, his choices toed a more traditional line. Sen. Marco Rubio, who serves on foreign intelligence and relations committees, for secretary of state. Rep. Michael Waltz, a Green Beret who also sits on related House panels, for national security adviser.\nSeveral immigration hard-liners were quickly -- but still somewhat predictably -- tapped to implement his call for mass deportations, including Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary and former acting ICE Director Tom Homan as \"border czar.\"\nBut after that came a series of namesthat shockedeven Trump's close Republican allies in Congress: former Fox News host Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, Matt Gaetz for attorney general and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to oversee Health and Human Services.\nWhile those four lack conventional bona fides to lead some of the country's top political institutions, all possess a skill Trump is said to highly value: being experienced on TV communicating and defending his biggest political goals.\n\"This will absolutely be a brand-new era in Washington, from the pledge to remake the civil service to a top-to-bottom change in federal policies. There's nothing like it in recent memory,\" said Donald Kettl, a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland and former dean of its school of public policy.\n\u201cThe job of a Cabinet secretary involves a lot more than giving interviews,\" Kettl said. \"These are very large, sprawling agencies on which Americans deeply depend. It would take little for them to drift into major crises that would both hurt Americans and give the administration a black eye.\"\nTrump recently said the biggest regret of his first term was installing \"disloyal people.\"\nInternal strife with his own staff was well-documented. He lambasted his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for recusing himself from the department's Russia investigation. He expressed anger at Defense Secretary Mark Esper for disagreeing with his suggestion to use active-duty military to quell street protests over George Floyd in 2020. They are now viewed as having been key guardrails -- keeping Trump's more controversial demands inside traditional lines.\nIn Gabbard, Gaetz and Hegseth, Trump has found potential agency heads (pending Senate confirmation, which could prove tricky for some) who similarly want to root out what he's long accused of being a \"weaponized\" justice system and a rebellious military.\n\u201cThe last time the transition was very traditional but I think that\u2019s because President Trump really had not been exposed that much to Washington,\u201d said Ron Nicol, who in 2016 directed the agency action team in charge of Trump\u2019s transition. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing now is choosing a team that will be focused on getting things done.\u201d\nHegseth, an Army veteran, has said in interviews before being named that he advocated a \"frontal assault\" on the DOD, including firing what he called \"woke\" generals and eliminating the Pentagon's diversity goals.\nGabbard, a former congresswoman who also served in the National Guard, has long railed against the so-called \"deep state\" Trump has blamed for undermining him in his first term and she's called Democrats a \"cabal of warmongers.\"\nGaetz, a conservative firebrand who resigned from Congress just after being named, has claimed the Justice Department is corrupt and even called for the FBI to be abolished. Gaetz himself was the subject of a federal investigation into potential sex trafficking, which ended without charges against Gaetz. He's denied the allegations.\nMany in the defense andjustice communities have balkedat the choices -- Gaetz for the nation's top law enforcement official, especially -- while Trump has said they would carry out his desire for reform.\n\"If what he means by that is burning them to the ground, then maybe,\" said Matthew Waxman, who served in senior positions at the state and defense departments during the George W. Bush administration.\n\"But if we're talking about serious institutional reform based on American values and careful deliberation, organization management and effectiveness, I don't see them as possessing any of those virtues,\" Waxman added.\nTrump on Wednesday attempted to blame Democrats for allegations levied against some of his more controversial Cabinet picks.\n\"They dirty them up, they destroy them, and then they spit them out. They are trying that right now with some great American Patriots who are only trying to fix the mess that the Democrats have made of our Country,\" Trump posted on his social media platform.\nBarbara Perry, co-chair of the presidential oral history program at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, said Trump appears to be running with what he perceives as a \"mandate\" from voters.\n\"He won, if not by a landslide, decisively. He views that as a compelling case for putting the people he wants who are the most MAGA in his mind,\" Perry said.\n\"No one could argue in terms of presidents putting people they support into these positions, that's their prerogative,\" Perry added. \"What is arguable is in the cases of at least four of these picks, they are unqualified.\"\nDonald TrumpJr., speaking with Fox News, said his father's picks will be \"actual disrupters\" and \"that's what the American people want.\"\nCobb, who worked for the Trump administration in 2017 and 2018, contended the president-elect may be \"overestimating\" the mandate.\n\"The three overwhelming issues of consequence in the last election were inflation, immigration and abortion,\" Cobb said. \"Obviously, immigration and inflation are things that people expect Trump to do. I think they discounted the persistent warnings of Trump being on a crusade for vengeance and for his own needs.\"\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"}]
