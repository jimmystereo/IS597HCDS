No question such disruptors shook up the campaign, helping to break the monopoly of the corporate media and giving a platform to new, more freewheeling voices.\nMEDIA LIBERALS SAVAGE KAMALA AS TRUMP PICKS EXPERIENCED HARD-LINERS\nInthe Free Press,author and former CIA analyst Martin Gurri argues:\n\"The campaign saw the news media, as an institution, take a giant leap toward irrelevance \u2014 and ultimate extinction. From the New York Times to CBS News, the grand old brands of the industry gambled what shreds of trust remained in them \u2014 31% by one measure \u2014 to exert influence on behalf ofDemocratic candidatesand progressive positions. They lost the public\u2019s trust, yet failed to move the needle.\"\nCiting a new term, Gurri says that \"coverage of the election felt like postjournalism on acid. Joe Biden received extravagant praise as a wise, experienced leader until he became a political liability. Then, overnight, the media pack tore him apart for being too old and infirm, memory-holing the fact that they had spent the past three years assailing anyone who questioned the lie that he was \u2018sharp as a tack.\u2019\nA side-by-side of Kamala Harris and President-elect Donald Trump.(Getty Images)\n\"Attacks on Trump were so bizarrely strident, and at the same time so ritualized, that they attained the aspect of parody if not wit. My favorite election story was The Atlantic\u2019s \u2018Trump Is Speaking Like Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini.\u2019 Not long after its publication, the three-headed super-totalitarian could be found cooking French fries at a McDonald\u2019sin Pennsylvania.\"\nHe also points to Washington Post conservative columnist-turned-Trump-hater Jennifer Rubin, who tweeted: \"It is 1933. Hitler is in power.\"\nTRUMP, DEFYING MEDIA PREDICTIONS, MAINLY PICKS SEASONED CAPITOL HILL VETERANS SUCH AS MARCO RUBIO\nAll this \"went beyond the old joke about rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic: It was fighting noisily over the best seats in the house, while an entire industry burned to the ground.\nI have to blow the whistle on the overheated rhetoric. While it\u2019s fashionable to dismiss the \"legacy media,\" they aren\u2019t headed for extinction or burning to the ground.\nIn this photo illustration, a girl looks at the CNN website on her laptop as she awaits the 2024 US election vote count between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.(Faisal Bashir/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\nFor all their flaws and bias, they do this thing called reporting. Most of the disclosures about the most controversial Trump nominees have come from big news organizations. And the most important moments of the campaign, the two debates and key interviews, have played out on television.\nStill, the times they are a\u2019changing.\nThe rise of Substack has provided journalists and others with an independent platform, and it has doubled down on politics while outlets likeMeta\u2019s Facebookand Instagram are minimizing such content.\n\"There\u2019s a desperate need for a quality platform with trusted voices, where honest-to-God political discussion, debate, disagreement can happen without it either disappearing into the ether or taking place on a platform where there\u2019s constant knife fights and flame wars,\" co-founder Hamish McKenzie toldthe New York Times.\nThe biggest stars have earned millions of dollars in subscription revenue. The Times says these include data guru Nate Silver and the Bulwark, the conservative, anti-Trump site. The Bulwark says it raked in about $6 million in annual revenue from Substack. Silver says he\u2019s making more money than at ABC.\nBut Substack,which Elon Muskonce tried to buy, is not profitable, since the company only takes a 10% cut of earnings. Musk temporarily refused to allow Substack links on X.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHowever this all shakes out, it\u2019s a strong platform for disaffected or laid-off journalists, as well as unknowns who build a following with their specialties.\nThe Comcast move telegraphs how much the media landscape has changed.

The American people wanted to end the Afghan war, and Biden was saddled with Trump\u2019s terrible deal with the Taliban. Inflation was a global phenomenon, and it was unfair to entirely blame Biden when, by 2023, America had the lowest inflation rate among the Group of 7 countries. The Biden administration had finally cracked down on the border and had endorsed a tough new border bill.\"\nWHY TRUMP IS STICKING WITH GAETZ, HEGSETH DESPITE NEW ACCUSATIONS \u2013 AND HIS 'MORNING JOE' MEETING\nFILE - Then-Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024, in Mint Hill, N.C.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\nHe adds that \"they also rightly argued that Trump nostalgia was misplaced. It was wrong to give the former president a passfor the pandemicor for the chaos and murder spikes of 2020. His term did not end in 2019, with peace and prosperity. It ended near the beginning of 2021 with disease, violence and cultural decay. Even the memories of the time before Covid are idealized.\"\nSo it was really Joe Biden who lost the election by letting inflation spiral \u2013 he was, in fairness, digging out of the pandemic \u2013 and turning the border into a free-for-all zone. He was also a terrible salesman for a series of bipartisan victories.\nWhen his mental decline became obvious at the debate, and he stepped aside for Kamala Harris, she had to run on that record \u2013 and famously told \"The View\" that she couldn\u2019t think of a single thing where she differed with the president.\nSo the powerless Democrats may be more screwed than you think.\nTHE PODCAST CAMPAIGN: IS IT CURTAINS FOR MAINSTREAM MEDIA?\nGiven the party\u2019s evolution from champion of the working class to representing the highly educated coastal elites in politics, academia and journalism, the Dems are left without a winning coalition they once took for granted.\nIn aTimes news story,Jennifer Medina writes:\n\"The working-class voters Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign needed were not moved by talk of joy. They were too angry about feeling broke.\nVice President Kamala Harris thanks and speaks with supporters after conceding to former President Donald Trump at The Yard at Howard University in Washington, DC on November 6, 2024.(Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\"The losses up and down the ballot leaveDemocrats in crisis. Voters without a college degree make up a solid majority of the electorate. Without them, the White House could be out of reach. And for a party that stands for and takes pride in its diversity, the erosion of support from voters of color calls its identity into question.\"\nWhat\u2019s more, in interviewing hundreds of working-class minority voters, Medina found that \"for many, hope had already hardened into cynicism. Promises about affordable housing fell flat and promoting accomplishments on insulin prices failed to break through. Simply put, their trust in the Democratic Party was gone.\"\nMEDIA LIBERALS SAVAGE KAMALA AS TRUMP PICKS EXPERIENCED HARD-LINERS\nNow that brings us toDonald Trump\u2019sself-proclaimed mandate, even if CNN was happy to report that Trump\u2019s vote share had dropped slightly below 50% (Who cares? He\u2019s the 47th president.)\nNow comes news, first reported by ABC, that an unidentified hacker has obtained the sworn testimony of Matt Gaetz accusers from the House ethics probe and apparently plans to make it public.\nThe hacker accessed the file through a law firm involved in a civil suit against Joel Greenberg, a former Gaetz pal now serving an 11-year prison term for sex trafficking. The file includes testimony under oath by a woman who says she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17, back in 2017, and from another woman saying she witnessed the sexual encounter.\nMatt Gaetz speaks at the Republican Party of Florida Freedom Summit, Nov. 4, 2023, in Kissimmee, Fla.(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack)\nAsked for comment, Trump transition spokesman Alex Pfeiffer said: \"Matt Gaetz will be the next attorney general. He\u2019s the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system.\n\"These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration. The Biden Justice Department investigated Gaetz for years and cleared him of wrongdoing. The only people who went to prison over these allegations were those lying about Matt Gaetz.\"\nTrump is making calls on behalf of Gaetz, and J.D. Vance is escorting him and other nominees around the Hill.\nThe Times reports that Trump realizes that Gaetz may not be confirmed. This is a matter of simple math, since most GOP senators have not committed to supporting him. Yet the president-elect will not back off or force Gaetz to withdraw the nomination.\nBut if Gaetz falls short, it would be hard for the Senate to reject a replacement nominee, who might have the same views on disrupting and perhaps politicizing the DOJ, but without the ex-congressman\u2019s baggage.\nThe House ethics panel, while stymied by Gaetz\u2019s abrupt resignation, is meeting today on the report.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOne new disclosure that could hurt him: Gaetz used his adopted son\u2019s PayPal account to pay one of the women, who was not a minor. Doesn\u2019t that sound like someone with something embarrassing to hide?\nThe Democrats have some influence in this process, as they\u2019d only have to pick off four of the 53 GOP senators to block Matt Gaetz. But they are also consumed by their election shellacking and will have a hard time defeating Trump on just about anything.\nHoward Kurtz is the host of FOX News Channel'sMediaBuzz(Sundays 11 a.m.-12 p.m. ET).\u00a0Based in Washington, D.C., he joined the network in July 2013 and regularly appears onSpecial Report with Bret Baierand other programs."}]
