The October 1vice presidential debatebetween Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrat, and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican, was likely the last meeting between the Democratic campaign led by Vice President Kamala Harris and the Republican campaign led by former President Donald Trump.While the scene is set for what pollsters expect could be an extremely close election,there will be unexpected developments between now and Election Day on November 5.Nobody expected President Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4scampaign to implodeafter theshock of his performance at CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s debate in late June. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Harris as his replacement.Nobody expected anassassination attempt against Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience.So we don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know\u00ac\u2020specifically\u00ac\u2020what will happen between now andElection Day, or what could come after, when the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect:Voting is well underwayCNNRelated articleYour personalized voter handbook for the presidential electionWhile Election Day isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t until November 5, most states allow some kind of early voting, either by mail or in person, and that process kicks into overdrive in October.Most Americans, nearly 70%, voted early or by mail in 2020, according tocensus figures, although that figure was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.The campaigns will be focused on getting out the vote in the few key battleground states they think are up for grabs. In 2020, Biden won five states that Trump won in 2016. Those states \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u201a\u00c4\u00ec could again be the focus in 2024 when Harris, who turns 60 in October, takes on Trump.It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s important to be sure you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re registered to vote as soon as possible, which can usually be done online. Twenty-three states and Washington, DC, allow Election Day voter registration.Election Day and beyondUS law requires federal elections to take place on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s November 5.People who don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t vote early will hit their local voting location. Polls will close at different times around the country. Due to the rise of voting by mail, if key states are close, like they were in 2020, we probably won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know the winner on Election Day.Regardless, expect lawsuits in certain states and the potential for recounts in others. Election Day is far from the end of the election.Separately,Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sentencingon 34 counts of falsifying business records is now scheduled for November 26.Also this month: Biden turns 82.December: Electoral votes are castAfter questions about the election are settled, states confirm, or ascertain, their statewide results. Electors gather in their respective state capitols to cast electoral votes for their statewide winner.Nebraska and Maine also allocate some electoral votes by congressional district, and these could be pivotal in a close race.January: Someone will solemnly swearThe new Congress takes the oath of office on January 3. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s this new Congress that, in the unlikely event ofan Electoral College tie, would settle the election. Each state would get one vote for president in the House of Representatives.In any event, lawmakers gather on January 6, as everyone should remember from 2020, to count electoral votes. Harris will preside. She could either be thefifth vice president in historyto oversee her own Electoral College victory, or the fourth in history to oversee her own Electoral College defeat.On January 20, 2025, the next president takes the oath of office.This story has been updated with additional developments.", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Experience the iconic Magic Wall", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/magic-wall/", "content": "", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/politics/senate-race-rankings-october-2024/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014With just over a month until Election Day, the same competitive races continue to dominate the Senate landscape, but there are a few significant changes to the order of CNN\u2019s ranking of the seats most likely to flip.And in the final weeks, the degree to which these 10 races \u2013 which are mostly playing out in statesDonald Trumpeither won or narrowly lost in 2020 \u2013 move in the same direction as the presidential contest will likely determine which party wins control of the Senate.Republican Senate candidate for Montana Tim Sheehy walks up to the stage during a rally for Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump at the Brick Breeden Fieldhouse at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana, on August 9, 2024.Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images/FileRelated articleHow the Senate GOP\u2019s potential majority maker is staying \u2018shielded\u2019 in push to oust Tester in MontanaRepublicans \u2013 who are virtually a lock to pick up the West Virginia seat and would need to either win the White House or pick up one more seat for the majority \u2013 have an incentive to nationalize many of their targeted races. Well-funded Democratic incumbents, for the most part, are touting statewide and local accomplishments and their support for abortion rights.Two states that are part of the Democratic \u201cblue wall\u201d \u2013 and also key White House battlegrounds \u2013 move up on this month\u2019s rankings, which are based on reporting, as well as fundraising, polling and advertising data. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are now in the middle of the pack of flippable seats, along with Michigan, which remains at No. 4.The oddity of this year\u2019s fight for the Senate is that Democrats have consistently led in the public polling of key races, but it\u2019s Republicans who are poised to gain seats and, potentially, control of the chamber.That\u2019s a reflection of the Senate map \u2013 but also increasingly some post-Labor Day tightening as GOP spending picks up and voters get to know their candidates. Still, no public general election polling that meets CNN standards has shown the Republican nominee ahead in any of the seats that Democrats are defending, save for West Virginia.And two GOP targets \u2013 Arizona and Nevada \u2013 are moving down the list because Republicans have not kept the races as competitive as elsewhere.Earlier this year, those two states were Nos. 4 and 5. Now, they\u2019re at 7 and 8.Florida Sen. Rick Scott, left, and Texas Sen. Ted CruzGetty ImagesRelated articleSenate Democrats launch first multimillion-dollar TV investments\u00a0in Texas and Florida as map grows more dauntingAt the same time, Democrats are trying to expand the map in hopes of mitigating potential losses. As CNNfirst reportedlast week, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is making multimillion-dollar TV investments in Texas and Florida. DSCC Chairman Gary Peters has insisted that this is extra spending that won\u2019t take money away from their defensive priorities. Texas remains at No. 9 on CNN\u2019s ranking, while Florida fell off the list earlier this year in favor of the race in deep-blue Maryland.Nebraska is a new state generating political buzz, but it hasn\u2019t earned a place on the ranking. Still, independent Dan Osborn\u2019s challenge to GOP Sen. Deb Fischer has prompted the National Republican Senatorial Committee to start spending here, and elections analysts have moved the race out of the solid Republican category.There remain lots of unknowns in Nebraska, but we\u2019ll be watching to see how that race \u2013 and the 10 others \u2013 develop over the next month.1. West VirginiaSen. Joe ManchinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/FileWest Virginia is essentially out of reach for Democrats, who had little chance of holding this seat without Sen. Joe Manchin running for reelection. Manchin, now an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is likely to be succeeded by Republican Jim Justice, the state\u2019s two-term governor.Justice has had his share of negative headlines, but in a state poised to back Trump by a significant margin, it\u2019s hard to see a world in which Republicans don\u2019t pick up this open seat.2. MontanaSen. Jon TesterAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileDemocrat Jon Tester, who\u2019s running for a fourth term in a state Trump has twice carried by double digits, remains the most vulnerable Senate incumbent this year. Republicans feel confident their nominee,Tim Sheehy, has an edge \u2013 and both Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales and the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter have shifted their rating of the once toss-up race toward the GOP.Democrats still see a path to victory for Tester, who has a proven history of defying the partisan lean of his state by communicating both what he\u2019s done for Montanans and painting a contrast with his opponents.Democrats are trying that playbook against Sheehy, trying to define the wealthy businessman and retired Navy SEAL, who moved to Montana in 2014, as an out-of-state carpetbagger who cannot be trusted. Recentlyunearthed audio recordingsof Sheehy using racist stereotypes to refer to Native Americans has played into that message, with Democrats arguing that he\u2019s alienating a crucial demographic in the state. In a debate earlier this week, Sheehy acknowledged his comments were \u201cinsensitive,\u201d saying, \u201cI come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color sometimes.\u201dTester\u2019s campaign is now leaning into abortion rights on the airwaves \u2013 an issue that\u2019s on the ballot in Montana this year. Arecent adfeatures a self-described \u201clife-long\u201d Republican woman arguing that Sheehy \u201cwants to take away personal freedoms.\u201dBut Republicans are invoking transgender issues in an attempt to cast Tester as a liberal who\u2019s been changed by his years in Washington, while Sheehy istrying to tie Tester to KamalaHarris\u2013 especially on immigration. Tester \u2013 who has not endorsed in the presidential race \u2013 tried to meet those attacks during their debate by pointing out that Sheehy would not have supported this year\u2019s bipartisan border bill that Republicans blocked.3. OhioSen. Sherrod BrownBonnie Cash/Getty Images/FileDemocratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing his toughest reelection in a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 points. Public polling still shows the three-term senator ahead of GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, although that is expected to tighten as more Republican voters come home to Moreno. Brown was at 47% to Moreno\u2019s 43% in a late SeptemberNew York Times/Siena College pollamong likely Ohio voters \u2013 not far outside the margin of error. But the reassuring news for Democrats: Brown was winning 10% of Trump voters.Democrats have seized on Moreno\u2019s recent comments at a town hall suggesting that some suburban women were single-issue voters when it comes to abortion and questioning why women over 50 would care about the topic. Brown pointed to the remarks as evidence that his opponent is out of step with the 57% of Ohio voters who last year approved a ballot measure protecting reproductive rights. WinSenate, a Democratic outside group, also launcheda new adwith a woman talking about the emergency abortion she underwent at 25 for an ectopic pregnancy, saying, \u201cOur lives don\u2019t belong in Bernie Moreno\u2019s hands.\u201d(Moreno\u2019s campaign said in a statement that he was \u201cclearly making a tongue-in-cheek joke about how Sherrod Brown and members of the leftwing media like to pretend that the only issue that matters to women voters is abortion,\u201d and that Moreno believes women \u201ccare just as much about the economy, rising prices, crime and our open southern border as male voters do.\u201d)The Senate contest in Ohio ranked as the most expensive congressional race on record, as of October 3, with total ad spending from both parties this cycle, including future reservations, exceeding $446 million, according to AdImpact. Brown \u2013 who announced raising $30.6 million in the third quarter \u2013 has continued totouthis work to pass the PACT Act to help veterans exposed to burn pits, while Morenotries to nationalizethe race by tying Brown to Harris and inflation and linking himself to Trump. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to GOP leadership, isattackingBrown over transgender issues to try to cast him as out-of-step with the partisanship of the state.4. MichiganSen. Debbie StabenowAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileMichigan remains the most competitive open seat on this list. Democrat Elissa Slotkin has held a narrow edge in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, but the absence of an incumbent and the competitiveness of the presidential race in the Wolverine State\u00a0makes it one that could come down to the wire.Slotkin, a third-term congresswoman, led Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers 47% to 42% among likely voters in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll, with Slotkin drawing 6% of likely voters who also said they would vote for Trump. Slotkin has a strong fundraising record \u2013 her campaign announced raising $18 million in the third quarter \u2013 but Republicans are pouring more money into this state, with the Senate Leadership Fund recently announcing a $22.5 million investment.Slotkin has been runningads on abortion\u2013 an issue that has helped propel recent Democratic victories in the state. Herspotsclaim that Rogers\u2019 past support for abortion restrictions makes him untrustworthy on the issue now. \u201cI\u2019m scared that Mike Rogers will continue to take away my rights,\u201d says one woman in a spot who says she needed an abortion to save her life.Rogers has been responding on air, speaking directly to camera while holding hands with his wife inone new spot,saying he respects Michigan voters\u2019 decision on abortion rights and \u201cwon\u2019t do anything to change it\u201d in the Senate.Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, scored the endorsement of the state Farm Bureau\u2019s PAC, which had previously backed Stabenow (the chair of the Senate Agriculture panel). Rogers, whom Democrats have attacked for living in Florida after he left Congress a decade ago, is runningspotsthat tout his Michigan roots and public service. Rogers and Republicans are alsoattacking Slotkinandthe Biden administrationover plans to support the building of electric vehicles, using the misleading term \u201cmandate.\u201d5. PennsylvaniaSen. Bob CaseyAndrew Harnik/Getty ImagesDemocratic Sen. Bob Casey\u2019s race against Republican challenger Dave McCormick moves two spots up on the list in light of heavy GOP outside spending, some tighter polling and the competitiveness of the presidential race in a\u00a0state that is part of Democrats\u2019 so-called blue wall of must-win states.September polling from Marist, Quinnipiac University, the New York Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer, Franklin & Marshall, CBS News/YouGov and Fox News all gave Casey anywhere from a 5- to 9-point lead among likely voters. Polls from CNN and The Washington Post around the same time, however, showed no clear leader.The two candidates, who met on the debate stage for the first time Thursday night, have been hitting the airwaves with competing messages, as have their allied outside groups. Democrats are going after McCormick onabortion,includingonead that features footage of him referring to himself as \u201cpro-life.\u201d The Senate Leadership Fund, which is adding $28 million to GOP sending here, and the pro-McCormickKeystone Renewal PAChave been attacking Casey over inflation andimmigration.McCormick\u2019s tenure as the CEO of FreeMarkets \u2013 a Pittsburgh-based software company \u2013 has also been featured in ads on both sides.The Democratic group WinSenateis accusing him ofoutsourcing jobsand pointing to his management of the company to argue that \u201cConnecticut Dave\u201d\u00a0 \u2013 he owns a home in the Nutmeg State \u2013 \u201cwants to buy our Senate seat.\u201d McCormick is running ads featuringformer FreeMarkets employeespraising him and touting the company\u2019s hiring policies.6. WisconsinSen. Tammy BaldwinMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesWisconsin also moves up two spots on the list amid signs that some Republicans could be drifting home toward their party\u2019s nominee, Eric Hovde, in his challenge to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.The two-term senator maintained a modest edge over Hovde in aMarquette University Law School pollreleased this week \u2013 51% to 45% among likely voters when third-party candidates are included and 53% to 46% in a head-to-head matchup. Baldwin had a similar 7-point lead in aNew York Times/Siena College surveyof the two-person race\u00a0taken around the same time.While Baldwin has repeatedly outraised Hovde, the Senate Leadership Fund is also pouring funds \u2013 $17 million \u2013 into the Badger State, and Hovde has plenty of his own money to pay for ads at the lower candidate rate if he chooses. (We\u2019ll be eying his third-quarter fundraising filing for details about how much the Sunwest Bank CEO had loaned his campaign through September.) Ads from Hovde \u2013 whose campaign recently underwent a shakeup \u2013 havesought to tie Baldwinto Harris, attacking her over border security, fentanyl andtransgender rights.But Baldwin, who\u2019s made an effort tovisit the red, rural parts of Wisconsin, has a well-defined brand. She picked up theendorsementof the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation this week \u2013 a notable get for a Democrat running statewide. Much of Democratic advertising has played up Hovde\u2019s past controversial comments and sought to cast him as a California carpetbagger \u2013 he owns property in Laguna Beach, even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin and his family\u2019s company is a prominent state brand.7. ArizonaSen. Kyrsten SinemaAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileArizona is a conservative-leaning purple state, where Republicans should ordinarily be able to pick off a Senate seat \u2013 especially an open one. But in the race to replace retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, Republican candidate Kari Lake seems to have hit a ceiling.The 2022 gubernatorial nominee is well known in the state, but not necessarily for the right reasons. She still refuses to accept her loss for governor and, despite tethering herself to Trump, is underperforming his polling numbers.Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego led Lake by 10 points among likely voters in aMarist polland 13 points in aFox News survey, both from mid-September. Lake was polling behind Trump in both surveys by 6 points and 8 points respectively.Lake and the NRSC areblaming Gallegofor inflation and immigration \u2013 pointing to his support for what they\u2019re calling the \u201cKamala Inflation Act.\u201d (Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.) And while the Senate Leadership Fund hasn\u2019t spent here, a Club for Growth-affiliated group is also airingattackson the congressman. Gallego, a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was on the airwaves for months introducing himself to voters statewide as a Marine veteran and istouting his supportfrom law enforcement andRepublican voters. He announced raising $21.7 million in the third quarter.8. NevadaSen. Jacky RosenAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileNevada moves down two spots on the list as Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen appears to be in a stronger position against Republican opponent Sam Brown in a state where Democratic prospects seem to have picked up since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.Rosen, who appeared at a Harris rally in Las Vegas earlier this week, led Brown by 10 points in aCNN pollin late August. Like Lake in Arizona, Brown \u2013 an Army veteran who first ran for office in Texas and lost the GOP primary for Nevada\u2019s other Senate seat last year \u2013 also appears to be running up against a ceiling.Rosen and Democrats are hitting Brownover his previous stances on abortion\u2013 which is on the ballot this year in Nevada. Brown, who says he supports current state law legalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks, has said he\u2019d \u201cclose the door\u201d on backing a national abortion ban.Rosen has had a fundraising edge over her opponent, and this week, national Republicans canceled their remaining independent expenditures in the state in favor of running hybrid ads with Brown, which allows them to benefit from the lower candidate rate in the ultra-pricey Las Vegas media market \u2014 a strategy they\u2019ve employed in races across the country to try to compete with well-funded Democratic candidates on the airwaves.9. TexasSen. Ted CruzTierney L. Cross/Getty Images/FileNational Democrats\u2019 decision toinvest TV resourcesin Texas was the first major signal the party is putting money where its mouth is on the competitiveness of the Lone Star State this year. Democrats see Republican Sen. Ted Cruz as unpopular and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred, as the man to beat him, even in a state that is still comfortably red at the presidential level.The first hybridadbetween Allred and the DSCC features Kate Cox, the woman who had to leave the state to seek an abortion after her fetus had been diagnosed with a deadly condition, and Amanda Zurawski, who sued the state after she was denied an abortion when experiencing complications. \u201cIf you\u2019re experiencing pregnancy complications in Texas, you\u2019re in danger,\u201d Zurawski says in the ad, \u201cand it\u2019s Ted Cruz and the anti-abortion extremists\u2019 fault.\u201dAllred has also tried to flip the script on Republicans byaccusing Cruzof \u201cdoing nothing to secure the border.\u201d Cruz, in turn, isattacking Allredover a vote related to the inclusion of transgender athletes in women\u2019s sports. \u201cBoys and girls are different,\u201d is how anotheradfrom the Republican opens. \u201cThis election is about keeping Texas Texas,\u201d Cruz has said.Cruz only beat Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke by 3 points in 2018. But Democrats hope that Allred, a former NFL player who flipped a Dallas-area House seat the same year, is a more formidable challenger and can turn out more minority voters. (Allred would be the state\u2019s first Black senator if he wins.)Even Republicans acknowledge that Allred is running a good race, and the NRSC is investing here to help Cruz and the state party. Still, Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, so this remains an uphill battle for Allred.10. MarylandSen. Ben CardinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/GettyImages/FileThe race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin remains in tenth place this month as Angela Alsobrooks fights to keep this seat in party hands. Joe Biden won Maryland by 33 points in 2020, but Republican nominee Larry Hogan \u2013 a popular former two-term governor \u2013 has a supportive super PAC committing $18 million to tout hisindependence.Alsobrooks, the Prince George\u2019s County executive, led Hogan by 11 points in a recentWashington Post/University of Maryland poll. She\u2019s become better known statewide and has made gains among voters who say they care about Democrats maintaining control of the Senate. The argument that Hogan would be another vote for Senate Republicans has been Democrats\u2019central pitchin deep-blue Maryland, especially onabortion rightsand Trump.Voters in the Post survey were split over whether Hogan would back his party\u2019s leaders in the Senate. He\u2019s winning nearly half of independents, as well as 18% of Democrats. And as he tries to combat Democratic attacks over abortion rights, he\u2019s run ads about being\u201cthe ultimate girl dad\u201dand \u201cone of the few Republicans who never caved\u201d to Trump. Hogan rejected the former president\u2019s endorsement earlier this year, but Democrats quickly seized on Trump saying that he\u2019d like to see Hogan win.Maryland\u2019s Future, the super PAC backing Hogan, is trying to localize the race byattacking Alsobrooksfor improperly taking advantage of tax breaks she did not qualify for, as firstreported by CNN. (Her senior adviser told CNN that she was unaware of the problem and that her attorneys are working with both the District of Columbia and Prince George\u2019s County to resolve the issue.)CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report.", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Yellen to warn that sweeping tariffs are \u2018deeply misguided\u2019 in swipe at Trump", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/politics/janet-yellen-donald-trump-tariffs/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned on Thursday that \u201a\u00c4\u00fadeeply misguided\u201a\u00c4\u00f9proposals for sweeping tariffswould ramp up inflation and hurt American businesses, offering a clear critique of former President Donald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s economic policy.The warning, delivered during a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City, comes as economic issues remain a top concern for voters with the election just under three weeks away.Trump has made his call for steep tariffsa key piece of his policy agenda, while Vice President Kamala Harris has warned his tariff plans would raises prices for American families, referring to it as a \u201a\u00c4\u00faTrump tax.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Yellen, who typically refrains from wading into politics and did not mention Trump by name in her speech, argued against across-the-board tariffs and a \u201a\u00c4\u00fago it alone\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 strategy on the global stage.\u201a\u00c4\u00faCalls for walling America off with high tariffs on friends and competitors alike or by treating even our closest allies as transactional partners are deeply misguided,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Yellen said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSweeping, untargeted tariffs would raise prices for American families and make our businesses less competitive.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd we cannot even hope to advance our economic and security interests \u201a\u00c4\u00ee such as opposing Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s illegal invasion of Ukraine \u201a\u00c4\u00ee if we go it alone,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut the issues we face today, from broken supply chains, to climate change and global pandemic preparedness, to China\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s industrial overcapacity, also mean we cannot simply draw from an old playbook.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Still, in a question-and-answer session following her remarks, Yellen defended the Biden administration\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision not to repeal Trump-era tariffs on China, telling the moderator, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think the main reason for that is that we look to China to address the practices that were emphasized in the [Section] 301 action, which went to issues of unfair competition, and China really did not address any of those issues.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faUntil China made a meaningful attempt to respond to the 301 unfair trade practices, President Biden felt we should not \u201a\u00c4\u00ec we should not reward China by lowering the tariffs,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she added.Trump implemented sweeping tariffs on about $300 billion of Chinese-made products while in office.

Threecompetitive Senate racesare playing out across the same terrain, with Democrats fighting to protect seats critical to their endangered majority.The November election will test whether the three states will march in lockstep \u2013 as they have all but twice over the past half-century \u2013 or whether they will choose different candidates, potentially complicating the winning path to 270 electoral votes for Harris or Trump.The blue wall states offer a window into the urgency facing Democrats in the final three weeks of the campaign as a wave of fresh anxiety settles in across the party amid concerns over whether Harris is effectively winning her relentless argument against Trump\u2019s fitness for office.\u201cYou know what? I would always want my side to be anxious,\u201d Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told CNN during a weeklong blue wall bus tour she\u2019s leading across the three states. \u201cIt means we\u2019re taking it seriously. It means we understand how high the stakes are.\u201dBrian Schimming, chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, said the closing chapter of the race \u201cfeels like 2016,\u201d when Trump narrowly carried his state and the GOP delivered a strong performance down the ballot. The former president visited Wisconsin four times in eight days earlier this month and is poised to return next week.\u201cIn three weeks, I\u2019ll be calling it the red wall,\u201d Schimming told CNN. \u201cI understand the fact that it\u2019s a very, very competitive state. There\u2019s no doubt about that.

It is a fight for something,\u201d Harris said Wednesday in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, flanked by prominent Republicans who have endorsed her candidacy. \u201cIt is a fight for the fundamental principles upon which we were founded. It is a fight for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can achieve together.\u201dHer campaign is intensifying its focus on persuading moderate Republicans and independent voters who are opposed to Trump to set other differences aside and support her \u2013 following the lead of former Wyoming Rep.

I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve hit our ceiling in the suburbs. There are Republican women, there are independent men, who are moving away, still, from Donald Trump.\u201dHarris campaign officials see parallels among suburban voters from Bucks County to Oakland County, Michigan, to Waukesha County, Wisconsin. But even as they seek to build upon their margins with college-educated voters, they are also working to make marginal gains among working-class voters.\u201cThe more incendiary the rhetoric gets from Donald Trump and the more extreme the positions get,\u201d Kanninen said, \u201cthe more we see an opportunity to build and expand on that suburban vote.\u201dBack whenPresident Joe Bidenwas in the race, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania were seen as his only viable path to winning 270 electoral votes.While Harris is less reliant on carrying all three states, it still remains her strongest path to the presidency. A wider path across the Sun Belt battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina has done little to ease anxieties among Democrats that she is struggling to close the sale against Trump.The Democratic governors of the three blue wall states \u2013 Whitmer, Tony Evers of Wisconsin and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania \u2013 kicked off a bus tour this week across their states to drum up support for the Democratic ticket.\u201cWe\u2019re going to need every single freaking vote we can get,\u201d Evers said during a stop in Hudson, Wisconsin, bluntly reminding Democrats of the hard work over the next three weeks.As Whitmer and Evers traveled across Wisconsin, they fired up party activists and implored Democrats to work harder than they ever have in an election season.\u201cStop wringing your hands and roll up your sleeves,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cElections are decided by what happens on the ground.

Only twice in the past 50 years have they not chosen the same candidate.The exceptions were 1988, when Michael Dukakis carried Wisconsin, while George H.W. Bush won Michigan and Pennsylvania, and 1976, when Gerald Ford won his home state of Michigan as Jimmy Carter took Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\u201cIt\u2019s been a little bit of happenstance that they\u2019ve ended up on the same side. The states are not demographically identical,\u201d said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cWhen the elections are this close, it\u2019s possible they could split.\u201dThere are already some signs that the states might deliver a split decision in 2024 \u2013 in part due to demographic differences and how the candidates are tailoring their messages.President Joe Biden speaks at the Philadelphia Democratic City Committee Autumn Dinner in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Tuesday, October 15.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleA rare Biden campaign trail appearance reveals a delicate balancing act for him and HarrisIn Pennsylvania, Harris lacks a key element of Biden\u2019s appeal: The Catholic, working-class son of Scranton had local and cultural ties to the state.Bidenhit the campaign trail Tuesday, speaking at Philadelphia Democrats\u2019 fall dinner, where he attempted to pass his support in the state on to Harris but also seemed to give her room to break from the Biden administration on some policy matters. He said Harris has \u201cbeen loyal so far, but she\u2019s going to cut her own path.\u201d\u201cEvery president has to cut their own path.

That\u2019s what Kamala is going to do.\u201dIn Michigan, Democrats for months have faced two major warning signs: An erosion ofArab American support, much of it concentrated in Dearborn, over the US role in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, and slippage among union members \u2013 a reality laid bare when both the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the International Association of Fire Fighters declined to endorse a presidential candidate.Trump has tailored his economic pitch for Michigan\u2019s auto workers, pledging tariffs on imported vehicles that he claims would rejuvenate the industry in and around Detroit.The former president\u2019s campaign has courted young, non-White men. But herisked undercutting those appealslast week in Detroit, when he compared the city to a developing nation and said that the \u201cwhole country will end up being like Detroit\u201d if Harris wins.Trump\u2019s effort to appeal to non-White men is part of a broader trend: While polls show Harris has built on the huge gains Democrats have made with women during the decade that Trump has dominated Republican politics, the former president could match those gains among men.At a campaign stop Monday night in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Harris\u2019 running mate, Tim Walz, made clear that the pair were trying to improve their standing among men in an election that polls suggest could have a potentially historic gender gap.\u201cThe message is sinking in with the women, fellas, so I\u2019m going to make a message to the guys here for just a minute,\u201d said Walz, the Minnesota governor. \u201cYou got any women you love in your life, your wives, your daughters, your mothers and friends?

That spending is split nearly evenly between Democrats and Republicans.Another $100 million is booked on Pennsylvania\u2019s airwaves through the end of the campaign.It\u2019s trailed by Michigan, with about $42 million spent through the first half of October and Democrats outspending the GOP there by nearly $7 million.

Four years earlier, Trump won by nearly 23,000 votes, with Jill Stein of the Green Party earning more than 30,000 votes.In August, Wisconsin election officials voted to keep Stein and independent contenders Cornel West and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the November ballot, even though Kennedy had requested his name be removed after ending his candidacy and endorsing Trump.Nationally, Stein is on the ballot in 38 states, including Michigan and Pennsylvania.The Democratic National Committee is targeting Stein in a new Wisconsin ad, with an image of her face morphing into Trump.\u201cWhy are Trump\u2019s close allies helping her? Stein was key to Trump\u2019s 2016 wins in battleground states,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cShe\u2019s not sorry she helped Trump win. That\u2019s why a vote for Stein is really a vote for Trump.\u201dWhile Democrats are concerned enough about Stein\u2019s candidacy to run a TV ad comparing her to Trump, party strategists believe support for the Libertarian Party candidate and Kennedy could also take votes away from Trump.Christine Fink, a retired hospice nurse from Eau Claire, said she was anxious about the outcome of the race. She believes Harris is taking Wisconsin seriously and is confident in her ability, but Fink is also making a backup plan if Trump returns to the White House.\u201cIt scares me quite a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve applied for dual citizenship in Ireland if it happens. I\u2019m thinking about moving if he gets back in.\u201dPhil Swanhorst, a retired city bus driver in Eau Claire who now leads the county\u2019s Democratic Party, said he was nervous about the result in November.

But after he lost, at the behest of the Trump campaign, they signed\u00ac\u2020phony certificates\u00ac\u2020falsely proclaiming that he won their states.Trump then tried to use those certificates to stay in power.

As Pence explained in 2021, the role of the vice president is entirely ceremonial. Congress\u00ac\u2020passed reforms\u00ac\u2020in 2022 to make that crystal clear.That new law also makes it harder for lawmakers to raise objections to a state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s electors by increasing the threshold for the number of House and Senate members required to do so.

He is also a board member of the National Rifle Association, which endorsed Trump.Unlike most other states Trump targeted in 2020 with fake electors, the certificates these Pennsylvania Republicans signed said they were only meeting in case a \u201a\u00c4\u00fanon-appealable court order\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 later determined Trump actually won. This was added after some GOP electors raised\u00ac\u2020last-minute concerns\u00ac\u2020over the legality of the plan.

Those votes could be decisive: The 2020 election was decided by 44,000 votes over four states.More than 1.2 million ballots were sent abroad in 2020 and nearly 890,000 were eventually counted, according toa report by the US Election Assistance Commission.Democrats have painted new GOP legal challenges as an attack on the franchise of service people who are putting their lives on the line for the country by serving abroad, though the civilian expat community is more centrally in the crosshairs of the Republican lawsuits. Election officials also say that last-minute changes to election procedures with ballots already sent out would not only disenfranchise voters but lay the groundwork to falsely cast doubt on the results.Lawyers for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat,accused Republicansin a court filing of seeking \u201a\u00c4\u00fato harass the Secretary and sow doubt about the integrity of the election.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9In Pennsylvania, GOP congressmenare askingthe court to set aside all ballots cast from overseas, including those from military voters, for further verification. The Republican National Committee, which is behind the lawsuits inMichiganandNorth Carolina, made similar requests for certain overseas ballots in those states to be segregated, foreshadowing the possibility for post-election fights to get those ballots tossed if the margins are tight.The Republicans will have to overcome several procedural issues that have been raised about their cases. But any court order setting overseas ballots aside to be counted later, after the disputes are resolved, risks giving Trump the appearance of a lead on Election Night that would likely be diminished once those ballots were added into the results. Key to Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s strategy in his efforts to overturn the election in 2020 was to argue that ballot-counting should stop after Election Day, before election officials had finished processing the Democratic-heavy mail-in vote.GOP officials say that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re trying to obtain clarity from courts about what they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve described as legal conflict in how those states are handling those ballots, as it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not entirely clear how many ballots would be tossed if they were to prevail in their cases.\u201a\u00c4\u00faRegardless of the number impacted\u201a\u00c4\u00b6we want every single legal vote to be counted properly, and counting illegitimate votes dilutes that and cancels it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 one RNC official told CNN.A hearing in the Michigan case is scheduled in Detroit on Thursday, while a federal judge will hear arguments on the Pennsylvania lawsuit on Friday in Harrisburg. A hearing in the North Carolina lawsuit is scheduled for next week.Less than half of overseas voters are militaryThe process for uniformed and civilian citizens abroad to cast ballots was established by the federal law known as\u00ac\u2020Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, or UOCAVA, which has enjoyed bipartisan support in the nearly four decades it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been on the books.The law is most associated with military voters, which are traditionally thought of as right-leaning, though that population is not as conservative as it once was. More significant to the political dynamics at play, however, is how the civilian overseas vote has eclipsed military voters abroad.Members of the military made up only\u00ac\u202042.3% of those registered to vote under UOCAVA during the 2020 election, according to the EAC report.Only a quarter of the ballots transmitted abroad by Michigan in 2020 went to military members, according to the report, and likewise in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, military members made up a minority of\u00ac\u2020the overseas voters receiving ballots from those states in 2020.\u201a\u00c4\u00faAs it turns out, there are more overseas civilian voters than there are military voters,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political science professor.Research he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s doneon Maine and Colorado voters has shown that the UOCAVA vote in those states has had a sizable Democratic-lean.Democrats Abroad, which is made up of thousands of Americans living, serving and studying around the world, has been phone banking, texting and emailing its database since January, according to its international chair, Martha McDevitt-Pugh, urging members to request ballots and giving them instructions on how to get them in.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are millions of voters who can affect the outcome of elections,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said McDevitt-Pugh.The Democratic effort\u00ac\u2020caught the attention of Republicans, a person familiar with the litigation told CNN, prompting lawsuits challenging the legality of a subset of those ballots.In lawsuits filed in North Carolina and Michigan, the Republican National Committee is focused on state laws that extended UOCAVA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s scope by establishing that US citizens abroad who never lived in those states can still vote if their parents or legal guardians lived there before leaving the country. (Michigan additionally extends this tie to spouses of former residents of the state).They argue those laws run afoul of provisions in the states\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 constitutions requiring residency to vote.\u201a\u00c4\u00faNorth Carolinians and Michiganders should not have their votes canceled by those who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve never lived in the state in the first place \u201a\u00c4\u00ec plain and simple. This is illegal and we will stop it. While Democrats want an election system that disregards the law, we are committed to election integrity across the country,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 GOP Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement last week.However, Democrats and state officials counter that the North Carolina and Michigan constitutions give those state legislatures flexibility to expand voter eligibility to beyond just those who have lived in those states for a certain amount of time.In Michigan, the Republicans are asking that guidance from Benson, a frequent target of GOP lawsuits, be changed to instruct local officials that they cannot accept overseas ballots by so-called \u201a\u00c4\u00fanever residents.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Her office says that there is no practical way of distinguishing ballots that come from overseas voters who have never resided in those states, and even if there was, reworking the procedures at this point would be impossible \u201a\u00c4\u00ec an argument also made by the North Carolina election officials who are being sued by the RNC.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe time to challenge the rules for voter eligibility is well before an election, not after votes have already been cast,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Patrick Gannon, a spokesperson for the North Carolina Board of the Elections told CNN, noting that the law in question was passed by state lawmakers more than 13 years ago.Pressed on the timing of the lawsuits, which were filed after election officials began sending out overseas ballots, a second RNC official claimed that much of their election integrity litigation is being decided in the weeks before Election Day.\u201a\u00c4\u00faJust because, maybe theoretically, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d be better if we can file earlier, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re still going to fight in court if we think election laws are being broken, regardless of what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s happening,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official told CNN, adding that there were election cases being decided during this period before the 2022 midterms.GOP congressmen suing their own stateIn the Pennsylvania case, the dispute is over how overseas ballots are being vetted.Republican members of the US House have sued in federal court over how Pennsylvania election officials are processing the applications from overseas citizens and are asking for a court order that would segregate those ballots for further verification.The congressional plaintiffs\u00ac\u2020all voted in favor of rejecting the 2020 election state certifications in Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s favor, despite a lack of evidence of fraud.\u00ac\u2020Democrats, who\u00ac\u2020intervened in the case, argue that the Republican lawmakers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 request could disenfranchise \u201a\u00c4\u00fatens of thousands\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of overseas voters, including those in uniform.Rep. Pat Ryan, running for reelection in upstate New York, led several of his fellow veteran Democratic colleagues in putting together a letter this week addressed to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warning that members of the military are at risk of having their votes infringed.\u201a\u00c4\u00faI didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think they could be even more disrespectful of veterans than Trump has been, yet somehow they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve gone even further in insulting and trying to disenfranchise veterans and military families,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ryan told CNN, calling the moves \u201a\u00c4\u00fastunning\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00faa disgrace.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Ryan, who voted from Iraq in 2008 nearing the end of his 15-month second combat zone deployment, called the procedures a \u201a\u00c4\u00fawell-oiled process that happens all the time and has been happening for many decades.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9He noted that each unit had a voting assistance officer and that everyone\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s identity had been verified many times long before they filled out their ballots.If election denialism is the goal, Ryan said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faputting our active duty troops in the middle of that traitorous behavior is beyond the pale.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faThese people are risking their lives for our country. They deserve to know now that their vote will be protected and counted,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said.The lawyers who brought the lawsuit on behalf of the Republicans did not respond to CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s inquiry, but in their complaint, they claim that Pennsylvania has \u201a\u00c4\u00faimplemented an illegal election structure that creates vulnerabilities and the opportunity for ineligible ballots to dilute valid ballots from military service members.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Those involved in the RNC cases in Michigan and North Carolina stressed that those legal challenges were not directed at military ballots but civilians who never lived in those states.\u201a\u00c4\u00faBy allowing overseas voters who never lived in Michigan or North Carolina to vote there, they are violating the state constitutions and jeopardizing eligible votes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Claire Zunk, the RNC\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s election integrity communications director, said in a statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur lawsuit does not in any way affect military voters\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 right to vote, which is protected by federal law under UOCAVA.

Trump has made inroads with Hispanic voters, but Vice President Kamala Harris still has an advantage \u2013 albeit slimmer than Joe Biden\u2019s in 2020 \u2013 with that demographic.Trump stood and nodded as he was asked some of the most pointed questions he\u2019s faced from voters on the 2024 campaign trail \u2013 including why he \u201cwaited so long to take action\u201d as his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and what he\u2019d tell the families of gun violence victims about his opposition to gun control measures.The former president didn\u2019t criticize the questioners but didn\u2019t budge on his positions, either. He largely ignored the detailed questions from the audience, frequently pivoting to attacks on undocumented immigrants.Ahead of Trump\u2019s appearance, the Harris-Walz campaign attempted to set the narrative with a news conference in Florida, featuring several children who came to the United States from Central America and were forcibly separated from their parents under the Trump administration\u2019s border policies.Harris, who appeared at her own Univision town hall last week, has repeatedly ripped Trump over the claims about Haitians, saying at a discussion hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists in September that the former president is \u201cspewing lies grounded in tropes.\u201dThe right-wing misinformation about Haitian people now living in Springfield \u2013 legally under Temporary Protected Status \u2013 has become a staple of Trump\u2019s dark and often misleading message on immigration. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has also doubled and tripled down on the conspiracy theories \u2013 over the objections of his home state\u2019s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, along with the city\u2019s mayor and police chief.A barrage of anonymous threats against the city\u2019s Haitian community led local officials to cancel a cultural diversity celebration and DeWine, who in September called the viral story a \u201cpiece of garbage\u201d and \u201csimply not true,\u201d eventually called in state police to protect students.Trump has previously said that the Haitian migrants, despite their protected status under federal law, are \u201cillegal immigrants as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d saying he wouldrevoke their statusand deport them if he wins another term in November.The initial question to the former president on Wednesday noted that remark, which like so many others came despite multiple attempts by authorities in Springfield to publicly quash the false claims. Trump did not respond directly, but \u2013 after acknowledging he\u2019s never been to the city \u2013 said he is planning a visit.\u201cI\u2019m going to be there and we\u2019re going to take a look,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand I\u2019ll give you a full report when I do.\u201dTrump said that the migrants are \u201ceating the pets of the people that live there\u201d during a debate with Harris in September. Pressed by the moderator, Trump said he saw people on television who said \u201ctheir dog was eaten by the people that went there.\u201dA spokesperson for the City of Springfield told CNN shortly afterward that \u201cthere have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.\u201dTrump was also asked by voters about his plan for the \u201cmass deportation\u201d of undocumented immigrants and why, earlier this year, he so fiercely opposed a bipartisan border bill on Capitol Hill.The legislation was championed by Oklahoma Sen.\u00a0James Lankford, a conservative Republican, but GOP support fell away after Trump blasted it, calling the deal a \u201cgreat gift to the Democrats, and a Death Wish for The Republican Party.\u201dThe former president did not directly answer either question, twice reverting to talking points about his administration\u2019s immigration policy and, on the issue of deportations, economic difficulties facing farmers.\u201cWe had the strongest border we\u2019ve ever had in the history, recorded history of our country,\u201d Trump said when questioned about his border plan. \u201cFour years ago, we had a border that was great. And again, people were coming in, but they were coming in through a legal process.\u201dWhen asked specifically who would do the jobs of migrant farm workers if he deported them en masse, Trump swerved into more lurid claims about undocumented immigrants, saying those coming across the US border with Mexico are \u201cmurderers, drug dealers, terrorists.\u201dCNN\u2019s Eric Bradner and Arit John contributed to this report.This story has been updated with additional developments.", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Key lines from Kamala Harris vs. Fox News", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/politics/kamala-harris-fox-what-matters/index.html", "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter.

Baier, continually interrupting, tried to get Harris to put a number on how many undocumented immigrants have been released into the country, while Harris instead tried to frame immigration as a larger problem that needs to be addressed.BAIER: So, your Homeland Security secretary said that 85% of apprehensions \u2026HARRIS: Well, I\u2019m not \u2013 but I\u2019m not finished. I\u2019m not finished. We have \u2013 but we have an immigration system that needs to be fixed.BAIER: It\u2019s a rough estimate of 6 million people have been released into the country. And let me just finish. I will get to the question. I promise you.HARRIS: I was beginning to answer.Harris pointed out that President Joe Biden\u2019s White House offered up an immigration bill as its first legislative proposal after taking office in 2021. Baier countered the House and Senate, then both controlled by Democrats, didn\u2019t consider the bill.Harris pivoted to talking about a more recentbipartisan effort to pass a new immigration lawthat was torpedoed in Congress by opposition from Trump.Baier also asked if she\u2019d like to apologize to three women, including Georgia nursing studentLaken Riley, who were killed by undocumented immigrants in recent years. Harris responded first with sympathybut no apology:Let me just say, first of all, those are tragic cases. There\u2019s no question about that. There\u2019s no question about that. And I can\u2019t imagine the pain that the families of those victims have experienced for a loss that should not have occurred. So, that is true.But then Harris added on:It is also true that if a border security had actually been passed nine months ago, it would be nine months that we would have had more border agents at the border, more support for the folks who are working around the clock, trying to hold it all together \u2026Baier interrupted Harris to play video of Alexis Nungaray, whose 12-year-old daughter,Jocelyn Nungaray, was killed in Houston. The suspects, who have been charged with murder, are both Venezuelan and were in the US illegally. Nungaray says her daughter is dead because the men were not detained at the border.BAIER: So, do you owe them an apology is what I\u2019m saying?HARRIS: I will tell you that I am so sorry for her loss. I am so sorry for her loss. Sincerely. But let\u2019s talk about what is happening right now with an individual  (Trump) who does not want to participate in solutions. Let\u2019s talk about that as well, in all fairness.Baier continued to hammer away on immigration, a top issue for many voters, particularly Republican and Republican-leaning voters. He asked when Harris, who at the outset of the Biden administration would say the border was secure, began to realize there was a problem. She said the immigration system and the border have been broken for multiple presidencies.We\u2019ve had a broken immigration system transcending, by the way, Donald Trump\u2019s administration, even before. Let\u2019s all be honest about that. I have no pride, and saying that this is a perfect immigration system, I\u2019ve been clear, I think we all are, that it needs to be fixed.Baier asked why the border agents union is supporting Trump. Harris responded:I think they\u2019re frustrated, and I get it. They want support. They want support. And that\u2019s what that border security bill would have done. These guys down at the border \u2013 these men and women, they\u2019re working hard. They\u2019re working around the clock. I get it.Despite her prior position of being open to decriminalizing undocumented border crossings as a Democratic presidential primary candidate in 2019, Harris said she does not support that now.I do not believe in decriminalizing border crossings, and I\u2019ve not done that as vice president. I will not do that as president.When Baier asked if this was anevolution in her thinking, Harris pointed to her record as a prosecutor taking on transnational criminal organizations.I have spent a significant part of my career going after people who present a threat to the safety of the American people, and cross our border with the intent of doing us harm and cross our border illegally, and I will do that work as vice president. I take that work quite seriously.From immigration, Baier pivoted to the wedge topic of gender. He noted that Trump\u2019s supporters have invested heavily in commercials that show Harris, again during that 2019 Democratic primary and in commentsunearthed by CNN\u2019s KFile, expressing a willingness toenable prisoners who need gender-reassignment surgery to obtain it.BAIER: So, are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained illegal aliens to transition to another gender?Harris had clearly prepared for this question and responded bypointing at federal law in place during the Trump administration:I will follow the law, and it\u2019s a law that Donald Trump actually followed. You\u2019re probably familiar with \u2013 now, it\u2019s a public report, that under Donald Trump\u2019s administration, these surgeries were available to, on a medical necessity basis, to people in the federal prison system. And I think frankly that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing, you know, stones when you\u2019re living in a glass house.Baier said Trump didn\u2019t advocate for that law and that no gender-transition surgeries occurred during his presidency.Well, you know what? You got to take \u2013 responsible for what happened in your administration.She\u2019s right. That\u2019s the cruel reality for presidents. It\u2019s also going to be true for her as she defends the Biden administration\u2019s economic and immigration record on Fox News. Harris said the ads about gender reassignment for prisoners, something that does not affect many voters, is a distraction.He spent $20 million on those ads trying to create a sense of fear in the voters because he actually has no plan in this election that is about focusing on the needs of the American people, whereas \u2013 $20 million on that ad on an issue that \u2013 as it relates to the biggest issues that affect the American people is really quite remote.Baier playedclips of Harrissaying she would not change anything in Biden\u2019s presidency and asked how hers would be different.Let me be very clear. My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. And like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership.Harris said most of her career has been outside of Washington and she will invite ideas from Republicans in office andfocus on housing and small businesses.There was an extended exchange on Harris\u2019 argument that her campaign represents an opportunity for Americans to \u201cturn the page.\u201d Baier pointed out she\u2019s been in the current administration for more than three years. She said it would be a shift from the era in which Trump loomed over politics.\u201cThat is about turning the page on rhetoric that people are, frankly, exhausted of, Bret. People are exhausted.Baier interrupted her to point out that more than 70% of Americans in some polling say the country is on the \u201cwrong track.\u201d Isn\u2019t part of that the Biden administration? Harris had been at an event with Republicans who are supporting her campaign, and she said exhaustion is bipartisan and it has to do with Trump.Over the last decade, it is clear to me, and certainly the Republicans who are on stage with me \u2013 the former chief of staff to the president, Donald Trump, former defense secretaries, national security adviser and his vice president \u2013 one, that he is unfit to serve, that he is unstable, that he is dangerous, and that people are exhausted with someone who professes to be a leader who spends full time demeaning and engaging in personal grievances, and it being about him instead of the American people.Why, then, Baier asked, does about half the country support Trump?This is an election for president of the United States. It\u2019s not supposed to be easy. It\u2019s not supposed to be \u2013 it is not supposed to be a cakewalk for anyone.To which Baier tried to get her to insult the people who support Trump. \u201cAre they misguided, the 50%? Are they stupid? What is it?\u201dOh, God, I would never say that about the American people. And in fact, if you listen to Donald Trump, if you watch any of his rallies, he\u2019s the one who tends to demean and belittle and diminish the American people. He\u2019s the one who talks about an enemy within. An enemy within, talking about the American people. Suggesting he would turn the American military on the American people.That was a reference toTrump\u2019s recent insistencethat the threat from Democrats, whom he calls the\u201cenemy from within,\u201dis greater than the threat from China or foreign actors. Baier played a short clip of Trump that seemed to downplay those words, but Trump has repeated them several times.Baier then turned to Harris\u2019 recent argument that Trump is unstable, a flip of the script after earlier in the year when Republicans were attacking Biden for not being fit for another four years in office.(Trump\u2019s) not stable. And we should all be concerned.To which Baier asked, \u201cWhen did you first notice that President Biden\u2019s mental faculties appeared diminished?\u201d It was a question that seemed to shock Harris, whose jaw dropped. She then defended Biden as having the judgment and experience to make decisions. When Baier asked if there were concerns about Biden\u2019s abilities raised, Harris said:Bret, Joe Biden is not on the ballot. And Donald Trump is.Harris said more people who worked with Trump in the White House have raised concerns about him.Even people who worked for him in the Oval Office, worked with him in the Situation Room and have said he is unfit and dangerous and should never be president of the United States again, including his former vice president, which is why the job was open for him to choose another running mate. So, that is a fact. That is a fact.After a brief exchange on foreign policy and how the US should keep Iran in check, the clock was ticking, and Baier started to wrap things up.\u201cMadam Vice President, they\u2019re wrapping me very hard here,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI hope you got to say what you wanted to say about Donald Trump, there are a lot of things that \u2026\u201dThere\u2019s more to say, I have a lot more to say \u2026But that was about it for the interview.Harris confronts repeated interruptions during Fox interview", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "What are your questions about the election?", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/politics/election-questions-callout/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Election Day is November 5, but Americans across the country are already casting ballots.It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a complicatedprocess to elect an American presidentthat pivots from voters in states in November to electoral votes counted on Capitol Hill in January.Let us know what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s on your mind so CNN can help explain things.", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "What the early voting data can and can\u2019t tell us about Election Day", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/politics/early-voting-election-what-matters/index.html", "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s What Matters newsletter.

The rules and dates are different in every state. Check out CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4sVoter Handbookfor information on your state.A poll worker hangs up signs at an early in-person voting site at Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College on October 16 in Marshall, North Carolina.Stephanie Scarbrough/APRelated articleWhat are your questions about the election?That doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t mean we are clueless about who is casting ballots so far. When CNN reports the number of early ballots returned or requested and, in some states, whether those ballots were cast by Republicans, Democrats or independents, the data is coming from Catalist, a company that provides data, analytics and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit advocacy groups, including insights into who is voting before November. Catalist supports progressive groups, but the data it shares is not partisan and it comes from the largest voter file outside of the two main political parties.I talked to Catalist CEO Michael Frias by video conference about where the firm\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s information on voters comes from and what it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s telling us at this point in the election. A transcript, edited for length and clarity, is below.How does one build a voter file?WOLF:You have a massive voter file. Explain what that means and what you do.FRIAS:Catalist is a progressive utility that works in politics,civic engagement work, and we put together a national voter file. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a group of registered voters in all 50 states, including the District of Columbia. What we do is collect that information and standardize it, and that enables some pretty powerful models to be built.Party registration is on about 15 state voter files, meaning when you register to vote, you can declare a party. In the other 35 states, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s modeled, meaning people take a look at people\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote history and other habits and then determine whether or not they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re Democrats, Republicans or independents.WOLF:I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think a lot of people realize that there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sort of a record of every time you vote. In many states, you can go online and see for yourself not how you voted but if you voted. Is that basically what you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re gathering?FRIAS:It just depends on where the elections are administered. Sometimes, city council races obviously have that. Cities have an ability for voters to look up their vote record and see if they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re registered in the right place and see what their vote history is. This data is separate. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s public because really we are engaged in a civic engagement.So this is about supporting ballot measures or supporting candidates, or, you know, ordinances. And so, you know, there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a way for folks to communicate with the citizens and make sure that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re aware of the upcoming issues and then encourage them to vote.Public information on voters is important for transparency in the systemFRIAS:I think it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s helpful for folks to understand that this is largely based on public data, right? The voter files are public because that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a key point of trust and transparency in how election administration is done in the United States.Historically, a voter file was literally a file, and it was in a cabinet, and you would go to a party office and say, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Hey, I need to go knock on some doors for a state legislative office.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 And someone would take their key and open a cabinet and say, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2All right, here\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s your list for the precinct,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and you get a fistful of paper.So Catalist really goes back like to the advent of this data becoming digitized and those voter files becoming accessible in a digital way. There are counterpart organizations on the other side, but it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s within this ecosystem.There really is nothing like Catalist outside of the parties, because Catalist has been around since 2006. So we sometimes say it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the longest-running voter file outside of the two major parties. And there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a bunch of nerdy other historical stuff.Who sees what?WOLF:So who is using this data, and how are they using it? At CNN, we get access to your early voting data. But who else is this built for?FRIAS:You (CNN) do not get individual record data. You get aggregate data. So you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have individual names at CNN. You just know how many people have voted and whether they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re young or they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re old or they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re male or female.Then we have a separate set of customers who actually are running campaigns or ballot measures, and they obviously are looking to reach out to folks. So that would include where they could send mail, a mailing address, where they could maybe make a phone call \u201a\u00c4\u00ec somebody who answers a volunteer canvas call or even polling.Is this why I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m getting random text messages all the time?WOLF:So when I get a text from a random number that I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t recognize asking me if I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m planning to vote, it potentially could have come from your data or somewhere like that?FRIAS:We do not do fundraising, so that would not come from us. Most of the text messages you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re getting that are fundraising, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a whole other universe of folks who are predisposed to having donated $5 one time to one campaign and then that gets into the machinery of email fundraising and text message fundraising, which we are not an active participant in.If you got a phone call to take a poll, we provide our data to pollsters. If you got a volunteer call or got a volunteer canvas knock on the door, that would be the data that would come from Catalist.What can the early data tell us?WOLF:In a number of states, people have begun voting \u201a\u00c4\u00ec more than 5 million people have cast ballots as of the moment on Tuesday when we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re talking. What is that data good for? CNN is reporting on some of that data for news purposes. But what is the value of tracking, in real time, who has voted at this point? Who else is using it?FRIAS:From a CNN or media perspective, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s interesting to see what the makeup is just broadly. Is it younger folks, or is it older folks? And comparing that to years past. Now it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a bit more challenging in 2024 because 2020 was such an anomaly, right? We had the pandemic. We had a large portion of the country that was staying at home.That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s one value to it \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which is, who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s voting and what are the general trends, just in big buckets \u201a\u00c4\u00ec males, females, younger, older, some racial breakdown of White, Black, Latino or AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders). So that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s very valuable.But campaigns at this point, whether you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re the (Donald) Trump campaign or the (Kamala) Harris campaign or all the other campaigns, there are a set of voters that you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been talking to throughout this election and have what we call a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Get Out the Vote universe.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 Those are people that have identified very early and repeatedly that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re supporters of yours and that they intend to vote.CNN illustration/Getty ImagesRelated articleWhy an election for 330 million-plus people may still come down to so few votesAnd so what you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re really doing at this point, if you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re a campaign, is you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re getting the list of people who voted, and you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re seeing how many of your supporters that you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been talking to or identified have gone ahead and voted. Because what you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re really aiming for is efficiency, right? You want to talk to the people that have not yet voted, and so getting that list and knowing who voted allows a campaign to move resources away from contacting those folks.In an ideal world, they get a reprieve from all the text messaging you just talked about. They get a reprieve from the phone calls and the door knocks because they voted. And so now it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s like, hey, how do we shift resources and make sure we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re contacting those folks that still have ballots or have yet to vote?Groups on both sides do this workWOLF:You guys are a progressive group, but obviously there are conservative groups that are also doing this kind of work.FRIAS:That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s correct. There are not a lot of groups that do what we do. But yeah, we serve the progressive side of the of the ecosystem and allow them to do this work.What do we know about 2024 so far?WOLF:But I guess the data is the data, and the data won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t lie. So what are we seeing so far? It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a little early. Way more than 150 million people are going to vote ultimately in this election. But what can you see so far?FRIAS:There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s two sets of data that we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re sending. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re sending people that have requested a ballot, and then we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re sending data on who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s returned a ballot. So think of the first as like the potential vote, and then think of the latter as the actual vote.I think what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re seeing right now, by and large, is that we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re reverting back to the more normal election, to 2016, which is, you know, people that tend to vote by mail skew a little bit older \u201a\u00c4\u00ec though we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re now starting to see that some of the younger voters enjoyed voting by mail in 2020 and have adopted that as their vote method.We don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t see early voting in the volume and the numbers that we saw in 2020. The big thing that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s making it hard to interpret this data is 2020 was such an anomaly.Note: The numbers are not down everywhere. After this conversation took place, Georgia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s election officials announced there had been record-breaking turnout on the first day of early voting in that state.Read more about Georgia.Voters enter and exit the polling location at the Savannah Civic Center on October 15 during the first day of early voting in Georgia.Richard Burkhart/Savannah Morning News/USA Today Network/Imagn ImagesWatch for more Republicans to vote early in 2024WOLF:What about the partisan breakdown? Are Republicans returning to mail-in voting after Trump questioned it in 2020? Are the proportions different than they were four years ago?FRIAS:What we knew in 2020 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and we don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have enough volume yet to know this with great certainty, but we are starting to see less of it \u201a\u00c4\u00ec is if you voted by mail, your likelihood to be a Democrat was very high. If you voted early, it was high, but a little bit lower. And then if you voted on Election Day, you were probably skewing more Republican.We don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t see that actually happening (this year) just because the volume isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t as great, one. And two is, I do think that themessaging from the Republican Party and from Trump himselfhas not been to question or to actually encourage people not to vote by mail.What to watch in the weeks to comeWOLF:What are the tea leaves that you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be looking for in the weeks ahead?  As more and more of this datacomes in, what can we learn from it in the next three weeks before Election Day?FRIAS:The biggest thing is: What\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the vote propensity? Who are these early votes coming from? Because there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a theory that early voting is banking votes, that these are regular voters. These are very good voters who, like, don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t miss elections. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a big percentage of those.But I think the big question that we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll continue to monitor is, are we seeing any signal that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s these irregular voters, these voters that are not typical presidential voters? Are they starting to show up in the early ballots that are being returned?The regular voters have tended to be more consistent with their partisanship support, and that has been pretty favorable to Democrats. When you start looking at irregular voters, those nonpresidential voters, they have shown up to be slightly more Republican-leaning.You don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know if you can count them or not, right? Because there are the undecided folks who are going to vote but are picking between Harris and Trump or whoever the candidates are. And then there are undecided voters who are undecided about whether or not to vote. And so it will be interesting to see what percentage of those voters are coming into the electorate.2022 was a surprise. Is it similar this year?WOLF:In the 2022 midterms, there were some surprises for a lot of people because Democrats overperformed what was the perception leading up into Election Day. Did you sort of start to realize before Election Day that things were not going to go according to the narrative or that Democrats might outperform some of the polling?FRIAS:There were two big things when thinking about the election. The first was, we got the sense that there were two elections happening, which is why we avoided the red wave.What our data suggested is in the places where it was competitive, where there were resources from both Democrats and Republicans, those were far more competitive and very similar to 2020 electorates.Where there wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t massive spending or just congressional races \u201a\u00c4\u00ec New York and California and other noncompetitive states \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it looked like a red wave. It performed the way you would think a midterm would perform, which is the incumbent party took on some water, and the opposition party made some gains.People wait in line to cast their vote during early voting at City Hall in Philadelphia on October 7, 2020.Gabriella Audi/AFP/Getty ImagesThe second big variable that we had a sense of and didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know what to make of was when we were looking at data in the blue wall states \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin \u201a\u00c4\u00ec we saw, well into October, a high number of undecided voters. It was 30%, 35% undecided still at this point in the election.The thing that made us nervous that we observed is usually the undecided voters break out just roughly a third, a third, a third: A third of them are Democrats, a third of them are independents, a third of them are Republicans. But what we saw going into Election Day (2020) is that the overwhelming majority of them were Republican.And so it left us with the question: What are the Republican voters that are undecided in late October going to do, right? Are they going to ticket-split and vote for the Democrat in these competitive states? Are they going to go home to the Republican Party and just be consistent with their party, or would they stay home? That was the thing that kind of led us to believe there might be something going on there, that the 2022 election might be a little bit different than what we had anticipated.WOLF:And has that trend carried on to 2024? Who the undecideds are?FRIAS:It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s less. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s equal enthusiasm right now among Republicans and Democrats, so they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re both really animated and want to vote. And also it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a presidential election, so people sort a little bit easier than in midterms.I think people have been banting about that there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s like 5% to 7% of truly undecided voters, meaning people that are undecided about who they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to vote for. They\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to vote. They have a good history of voting, but they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re just trying to decide. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a very small portion. In the midterms, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s much bigger, because they are state races, not hyper-partisan presidential elections.", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Harris clashes with Fox as she tries to peel away some GOP voters", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/politics/harris-fox-new-trump-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Kamala Harris didn\u2019t get her second debate with Donald Trump \u2014 soshe went on Fox Newsinstead.The vice president clashed heatedly with the pro-Trump network\u2019s top anchor Bret Baier on Wednesday night in the kind of adversarial, unscripted scrum that Republicans have long accused her of avoiding.Harris and Baier squabbled and interrupted one another, as he exposed her policy flip flops and reversals and she rammed home her talking points. The contentious clash, conducted in swing state Pennsylvania, had more in common with the vice president\u2019s sole debate showdown with the former president than forensic, formal interviews where she\u2019s often stumbled.US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign event at Washington Crossing Historic Park with supportive Republicans in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, October 16, 2024.

Trump\u2019s decision to decline a second debate with his rival has meant that the final weeks of the campaign lack big scheduled moments that could change the race.In the end, on Wednesday, both Harris and Fox News probably got what they wanted.The vice president looked combative after daring to walk into the conservative media lair and struck a contrast with Trump, who is largely avoiding television news interviews in which he will be cross-examined. She singled out his extreme rhetoric and threats to use the military on \u201cenemies from within\u201d \u2014 in a way the channel\u2019s viewers rarely see. Her performance bolstered her new campaign tactic of raising fresh alarm about a second Trump term that she said in a speech earlier Wednesday would see the ex-president sit in the Oval Office \u201cplotting retribution, stew in his own grievances and think only about himself and not you.\u201dHarris also did some damage control after saying in an interview last week that there wasn\u2019t much she would have done differently from the unpopular commander in chief over the past four years. \u201cMy presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency,\u201d Harris said. \u201cLike every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences and my professional experiences and fresh and new ideas.\u201dA poll worker hangs up signs at an early in-person voting site at Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College on October 16 in Marshall, North Carolina.Stephanie Scarbrough/APRelated articleWhat are your questions about the election?Fox, meanwhile, got hours of post-interview content for its commentators. Its post-debate analysis, for instance, seized on Harris\u2019 non-answer to one of Trump\u2019s charges \u2014 how many undocumented migrants let into the country on her watch. As the network spooled highlights of the interview, it ran a chyron that read \u201cKamala continues her tirade against Trump.\u201dBaier pressed Harris on issues important to the conservative audience, including tragedies of young American women murdered by undocumented migrants \u2014 for whom the vice president expressed deep sympathy \u2014 andher previous supportfor using taxpayer dollars to fund gender-affirming care\u00a0for transgender inmates, including undocumented immigrants. (She said she would follow the law on such policies as president).Video Ad Feedback'Wise': Buttigieg on Harris' handling of interview question about gender transition surgery02:25- Source:CNNAnd in case Harris changed the minds of any of its viewers, Fox followed her appearance with searing rebuttals from Trump\u2019s older sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, and his former ultra-hardline political adviser Stephen Miller.The tightrope that Harris was walking as she sought to show steel and presidential mettle was evident from critiques of her performance on social media that often played into tropes directed at strong, Black women.But before the interview, Harris spokesman Ian Sams explained her thinking. He noted Fox\u2019s high ratings include some undecided voters and Democrats. And he said that Harris wanted those viewers to hear from her directly.Another day of courting distinct voting blocsThe Fox interview capped another day Harris used to try to peel away potentially small numbers of voters who could make a difference in tightly fought battlegrounds less than three weeks before the neck-and-neck election.After courting Black male voters on Tuesday, she traveled to the Keystone State to try and appeal to Republicans who are disaffected with Trump\u2019s anti-democratic behavior. Appearing with Republican former lawmakers and officials driven out of their party by Trump, the vice president noted that finding her in such company would normally be surprising.But she added, \u201cNot in this election, because at stake in this race are the democratic ideas that our founders and generations of Americans before us have fought for. At stake in this election is the Constitution of the United States.\u201dVice President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign event at Washington Crossing Historic Park with supportive Republicans in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, October 16, 2024.Ryan Collerd/AFP/Getty ImagesDemocrats believe there may be significant numbers of GOP voters, including some who voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the Republican primary, who could be persuaded to vote for Harris next month. If only a few thousand Fox viewers or traditional conservatives swapped sides, it could push some swing states in the vice president\u2019s direction. Still, the risk for Harris is that her display in her first formal Fox interview could alienate some of those voters. And the 100 or so Republicans who appeared with her on Wednesday in Bucks County, a critical Philadelphia suburb, in many cases represented the GOP\u2019s past \u2014 left behind in the populist transformation engineered by Trump.Trump plays into Harris\u2019 claims he\u2019s unhingedAt that Pennsylvania rally, Harris reinforced her newly tough tone against Trump, blasting him as \u201cincreasingly unstable and unhinged.\u201d She\u2019s also been raising questions about his age and faculties \u2013 turning the tables on the 78-year-old ex-president who often used the same strategy against Biden when he was in the race.In many of his recent appearances, Trump has seemed to play into Harris\u2019 claims.\u00a0On Wednesday, for instance,he doubled downon his false claims that Haitian migrants were eating cats and dogs in Ohio. He said in a Univision town hall with undecided Latino voters that the refugees, who are in the country legally, were \u201ceating other things too that they\u2019re not supposed to be.\u201dFormer President Donald Trump speaks during a Univision town hall on October 16, 2024, in Doral, Florida.Alex Brandon/APThe Republican nominee also proclaimed himself \u201cthe father of IVF\u201d in his latest attempt to distance himself from the chaos in women\u2019s reproductive health after the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority, which he built, overturned the constitutional nationwide right to an abortion. Harris later told reporters that the comment was \u201cbizarre,\u201d as she seeks to use subsequent state-level abortion restrictions to widen the gender gap that could help her beat Trump.And as Democrats increasingly highlight the perceived threat to American democracy from Trump, the Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance, insisted that the former presidentdid not lose the last election.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve answered this question directly a million times: No. I think there are serious problems in 2020,\u201d the Ohio Republican said. \u201cSo, did Donald Trump lose the election? Not by the words that I would use, OK?\u201dTrump, meanwhile, insisted in a Univision town hall, that January 6, 2021 \u2013 one of the most notorious days in American history \u2013 was a \u201cday of love\u201d and that there was \u201cnothing done wrong at all.\u201dAny one of Trump\u2019s recent comments would have disqualified a conventional candidate. But it is a mark of how he\u2019s transformed American politics that his support base is impervious to scandalous or outlandish behavior.And there is no doubt that Trump, for all his crudeness and tearing at the constraints meant to rein in demagogic leaders, is the authentic voice of tens of millions of Americans.Harris is also hampered by a daunting political environment. She\u2019s a member of an unpopular administration at a time when many Americans are still feeling the after effects of the high inflation that the White House often downplayed and are frustrated by still high prices for rent, cars and groceries.It\u2019s taken her several months to arrive at the assurance that she\u2019d strike a strong contrast with Biden\u2019s administration, which she unveiled in the Fox interview. In itself, that\u2019s a reflection of her struggles as a presidential candidate. And her difficulty at the start of the Fox interview to effectively parry some of Baier\u2019s questions on immigration showed that the issue remains a weakness and may be a significant impediment to her efforts to win over GOP defectors.Still, the fact she braved the interview at all might help her with undecided voters. And if nothing else, her appearance served to highlight how the conservative media machine and Trump\u2019s are all but indistinguishable from one another.", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Pay attention to what Trump is actually saying in these key lines from Fox and Bloomberg", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/politics/donald-trump-speeches-what-matters/index.html", "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free\u00ac\u2020here.CNN\u2014Former President Donald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recent campaign appearances have generated an odd mix of headlines.These include his worrisome promise to use the US military against his political opponents, whom he called \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe enemy from within.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also the transformation of a staged town hall into astrange 39-minute music listening sessionthat some supporters have said was inspiring but looked very awkward to those paying attention on TV.While Trump has pulled out of interviews with CBS\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 \u201a\u00c4\u00fa60 Minutes\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and with CNBC, he has taken some questions elsewhere.It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s worth looking a little more broadly at what exactly Trump is saying as the endgame of the presidential election approaches. It shows a man who veers from thought to thought, has an exceptionally high opinion of his abilities, does not think there are any experts who know more than him and would use the power of the presidency in unprecedented ways.The below quotes will feel long, but Trump has a tendency to make points in a meandering stream of consciousness he calls\u201a\u00c4\u00fathe weave.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9He views himself as the \u201a\u00c4\u00f2father of IVF\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Trump was excited to get aquestion on Tuesday on the issue of in vitro fertilizationduring a Georgia town hall on the Fox News program, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Faulkner Focus,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that featured only women in the audience.I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m the father of IVF, so I want to hear this question.Trump went on to say that he and Republicans were totally in favor of IVF, not mentioning that many anti-abortion-rights activists oppose the procedure. He said Democrats\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attempts to say IVF would be in danger on his watch are wrong. But despite viewing himself as the \u201a\u00c4\u00fafather of IVF,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he did say he needed it explained to him after Alabama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Supreme Court suspended access to the procedure in that state. The legislature later restored access.I said explain IVF, very quickly. And within about two minutes, I understood it. I said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2No, no, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re totally in favor of IVF.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 I came out with a statement within an hour, a really powerful statement with some experts, really powerful. And we went totally in favor, the Republican Party, the whole party. Alabama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s legislature a day later overturned, meaning approved it, overturned. Overturned, the judge essentially approved it. And we really are the party for IVF. We want fertilization, and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s all the way.He won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t commit to raising the child tax creditTrump was asked by a woman in the Fox town hall about what he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll do for mothers like her who have seen thechild tax creditshrink in recent years. Neither the Fox host nor Trump mentioned that, after the tax credit was increased by Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s tax bill, Democrats further increased it temporarily during the Covid-19 pandemic. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s likely that the expiration of that temporary pandemic extension is what the woman felt go away.Trump also didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t mention that his ownindividual tax measures are expiringnext year. Everyone expects some kind of extension, but Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s answer, which harkened back to his 2017 tax cut law, was not an endorsement of an across-the-board increase.My daughter, Ivanka, she said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Dad, we have to do tax credits for women, you know, for the child tax credits.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 She was driving me crazy. Then I did it and I got it just about done. \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Dad, you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve got to double it up.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 I said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Ivanka\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it was actually more complicated than the entire bill, but I got it done. And what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to do, and I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m going to, because I understand exactly what you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re saying, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to readjust things so that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fair to everybody, because it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s really not fair to everybody. But we have a lot, and we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going up higher, but we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re also going to readjust, because you have to make some readjustments. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unfair to some people, and we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to have that.The \u201a\u00c4\u00f2enemy from within\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 is DemocratsTrump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s supporters have argued that when he talked about using the military inside the US, he was answering a question on Sunday from Maria Bartiromo of Fox News about Chinese migrants and data that suggests thousands of people with criminal records have come across the US border and whether there will be a peaceful Election Day.Note: Bartiromo\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s question is flawed. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s absolutely no indication of an army of migrants trying to disrupt Election Day. None. But Trump said there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a bigger threat.I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within, not even the people that have come in and destroying our country, by the way, totally destroying our country. The towns, the villages, they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re being inundated. But I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re the problem in terms of Election Day. I think the bigger problem are the people from within. We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re the \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and it should be very easily handled by \u201a\u00c4\u00ec if necessary, by National Guard or, if really necessary, by the military, because they can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t let that happen.Later, Bartiromo came back to this idea and asked how Trump will \u201a\u00c4\u00faguard against the bureaucrats undermining you in a second term.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trump made clear that when he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s talking about \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe enemy from within,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s talking about Democrats and his political opponents.Well, they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to undermine \u201a\u00c4\u00ec well, I always say, so, we have two enemies. We have the outside enemy, and then we have the enemy from within. And the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia and all these countries, because if you have a smart president, he can handle them pretty easily. I handled \u201a\u00c4\u00ec I get along great with all of them. I handled them. But the thing that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s tougher to handle are these lunatics that we have inside, like Adam Schiff, Adam \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Shifty\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 Schiff \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a total sleazebag, is going to become a senator. But I call him the enemy from within. When you look at the danger he put our country in potentially with Russia with a phony, made-up deal that he made up with Hillary and some bad people, that was \u201a\u00c4\u00ec that started off as an excuse for why she lost an election that a lot of people thought she should have won, because the polls indicated she might win.He doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think handing out tax cuts would add $7.5 trillion to the national debtBartiromo did ask Trump a good question about his economic proposals, which is full of tax cuts for seniors, wage earners, car buyers and more. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHow will you pay for it?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she asked, noting the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget saidhis tax plan would add $7.5 trillion to the national debt.But they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know. They have no clue.Bartiromo noted that The Wall Street Journal concluded Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s plans would increase the debt more than Vice President Kamala Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 proposals would. Trump says hisplan for across-the-board tariffs, which are taxes on imports, will spark a domestic manufacturing boom. He says foreign companies will pay the tariffs rather than importers and consumers, whicheconomists say is false.To me, tariff is a very beautiful word. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a word that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to make our country rich again. Without tariffs, we have a busted country.He doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t care about the specifics of his tariff planBartiromo noted that The Journal and others have said the prices just get passed on to consumers. Trump said his goal is not to drive up prices but to make it so expensive for Chinese exports \u201a\u00c4\u00ec perhaps a 500% tariff \u201a\u00c4\u00ec that no Chinese company will sell a single car in the US. Details are still in the works. Even Bartiromo was confused.BARTIROMO: So, your thinking is, is the threat of a 200% tariff will stop them from taking the car?TRUMP: Sure, of course.BARTIROMO: So you won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t actually have to do it, so you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to actually push prices higher? That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s your thinking?TRUMP: Of course. I never \u201a\u00c4\u00ec until now, I said 200.I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m using that just as a figure of speech.BARTIROMO: But you say 200 a lot.TRUMP: Oh, I will say \u201a\u00c4\u00ec well, I will say 100, 200. I will say 500. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t care. They\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to bring cars into this country \u201a\u00c4\u00b6BARTIROMO: I see.He doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think experts know what they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re talking aboutIt was not as friendly of an interview on Tuesday in Chicago when Trump took questions from Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait. Trump wasagain asked about the trillionsThe Wall Street Journal and others say his tax proposals would add to the debt, and the former president said experts on the economy are all wrong.What \u201a\u00c4\u00ec what does The Wall Street Journal know? I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m meeting with them tomorrow. What does The Wall Street Journal know? They\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been wrong about everything. So have you, by the way.You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been wrong about everything.Rejecting data and expertise is a theme with Trump. It could be jobs data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, crime data from the FBI or just about anything he doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t agree with.He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00f2better\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 than the Fed chairmanTrump also said that while a president shouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have full leeway to raise or lower interest rates, he should get more sway with the Federal Reserve if he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s elected because he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fabetter\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 than Fed Chair Jerome Powell.I think I have the right to say, as a very good businessman and somebody that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s used a lot of sense, I think I have the right to say that, you know \u201a\u00c4\u00ec I think I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m \u201a\u00c4\u00ec I think I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m better than he would be. I think I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m better than most people would be in that position. I think I have the right to say, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2I think you should go up or down a little bit.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 I \u201a\u00c4\u00ec I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think I should be allowed to order it, but I think I have the right to put in comments as to whether or not interest rates should go up or down, yeah.He won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t say if he still talks to PutinThe journalistBob Woodward reports in a new bookthat Trump has been in periodic contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin since leaving office.Trump wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t tell Micklethwait if he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d talked to Putinor not. But so what, in his opinion?TRUMP: Well, I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t comment on that. But I will tell you that if I did, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a smart thing. If I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m friendly with people, if I have a relationship with people, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a good thing, not a bad thing, in terms of a country. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s got 2,000 nuclear weapons and so do we.

I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t \u201a\u00c4\u00b6MICKLETHWAIT: You talk about \u201a\u00c4\u00b6TRUMP: I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t ever say it.MICKLETHWAIT: \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 talked to Netanyahu. You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve talked to \u201a\u00c4\u00b6TRUMP: But I can tell you what, Russia has never had a president that they respect so much. But more importantly, or less importantly, I guess, I went into Russia and people said, oh he likes Putin and Putin likes him. Let me tell you, the first thing I did was terminated Nord Stream 2. Nobody ever heard of Nord Stream 2.Trump won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t say if he still talks to Putin, but he does say that he stood up to Putin during his first term as president by spiking a pipeline that took natural gas from Russia to Europe, bypassing Ukraine. CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Daniel Dale hasfact-checked Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s claimin the past. Trump did approve the sanctions on companies working on the project, but only after he was essentially forced to by an overwhelmingly vote in Congress. It also occurred three years into his presidency. The pipeline was completed despite the sanctions but never began operating.The US is a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2developing nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Micklethwait noted the US won World War II and the Cold War with help from allies and asked Trump how slapping tariffs on allies will help the US now.It helps us tremendously, because China thinks we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re a stupid country, a very stupid country. They can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t believe that somebody finally got wise to them. Not one president \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Bush, Obama, Barack Hussein Obama. Have you heard of him? Not one president. Think of it. Not one president charged China anything. They said, oh, they are a Third World nation. They are developing. Well, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re a developing nation too. Take a look at Detroit. Take a look at our cities. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re a developing nation. We have to develop more than they do. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re way behind them. You take a look at what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s happened to our cities. So, what I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m saying is this.Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments about Detroit have led to some political backlash since the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s current renaissance is a point of pride for Michiganders, according toCNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s report.He likes to insult Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 intelligenceIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a theme. In the Bartiromo interview, Trump said Harris gave \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe dumbest answer I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve ever heard\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 during her \u201a\u00c4\u00fa60 Minutes\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 interview. He told both Bartiromo and Micklethwait variations of: \u201a\u00c4\u00faShe is not as smart as Biden, if you can believe it.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Now it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s OK for people over 80 to be presidentRepublicans and Trump in particular attacked President Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s mental acuity to the point that, after his befuddleddebate performance against Trumpin June, Biden, 81, dropped out of the race. Now that Harris is attacking Trump, 78, for his acuity, Trump is defending the ability of older people to hold positions of power.Micklethwait asked Trump is he would appoint a 78-year-old as CEO of a company.Some of our great world leaders are in the 80s. And if you look throughout history, some of our greatest world leaders were in their 80s. No, that wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t bother me. But, you know, I took two cognitive tests and I \u201a\u00c4\u00ec I aced them both. I think that, frankly, people regardless should take \u201a\u00c4\u00ec if they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re 50 or 40 or \u201a\u00c4\u00ec I think people should take cognitive tests, not because of the age but because of something else. Now, here\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the problem \u201a\u00c4\u00ec they say it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unconstitutional, OK? But I would love to see cognitive tests. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think she could pass a cognitive test. I mean, I \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve watched. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think she could pass a cognitive test.He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s playing geopolitical checkers, not chessTrump acknowledged that having the dollar as the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s currency is valuable to the US. He would keep it that way with threats and intimidation, his version of playing checkers.And if you want to go to Third World \u201a\u00c4\u00ec if you want to go to Third World status, lose your reserve currency. We have to have it. We cannot lose it. If you go to \u201a\u00c4\u00ec you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll go to Third World status in this country, because you take a look at the way things are running. If a country tells me, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Sir, we like you very much, but we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to no longer adhere to being in the reserve currency. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to salute the dollar anymore.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll say, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s OK, and you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to pay a 100% tariff on everything you sell into the United States, and we love your product. I hope you sell a lot of it into the United States, but you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to pay 100% tariff.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 He will then follow it up by saying, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Sir, it would be an honor to stay with the reserve currency.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 I will be \u201a\u00c4\u00ec that will be like just playing \u201a\u00c4\u00ec that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not even chess; that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s checkers.January 6 was a day of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2love and peace\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Trump takes no responsibility for his supporters trying to disrupt the counting of electoral votes on January 6, 2021. Despite all of the video that shows thousands of supporters storming the Capitol, Trump buys into false conspiracy theories that something \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrange\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 was happening to instigate them. He also thinks it was a very small number of people who overwhelmed Capitol Police.The primary scene in Washington was hundreds of thousands, the largest group of people I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve ever spoken before, and I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve spoken \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and it was love and peace. And some people went to the Capitol. And a lot of strange things happened there. A lot of strange things with people being waved into the Capitol by police, with people screaming, go in with \u201a\u00c4\u00ec that never got into trouble, you know? I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to mention names, but you know who they are. A lot of strange things happened.Trump also argued the transfer of power in 2021 was peaceful.But you had a peaceful, very peaceful. I left. I left the morning that I was supposed to leave. I went to Florida. And you had a very peaceful transfer. This was not a \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll tell you what, those people that did go there, which was a tiny fraction of the people that went to Washington. I mean, you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re talking about a very, very small, because there were hundreds of thousands of people, and I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t \u201a\u00c4\u00ec what, you had 500, 600, 700 people go down to the Capitol.To which Micklethwait said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou had a peaceful transfer of power compared to Venezuela, but it was by far the worst peaceful transfer of power in a long time.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Accurate.He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to \u201a\u00c4\u00f2straighten out\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 the pressDuring an exchange onhis mistrust of Google and the potential for breaking up the internet giant and his reversal on the need to ban TikTok, Trump said something interesting about the free press in the US. He was specifically asked if he still sees Chinese ownership of TikTok as a security threat.I think it is a threat. I \u201a\u00c4\u00ec I \u201a\u00c4\u00ec frankly, I think everything\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a threat. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nothing that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not a threat. But sometimes, you have to fight three of these threats. You know, you can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t just \u201a\u00c4\u00ec like Google. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not a fan of Google. They treat me badly. But if you \u201a\u00c4\u00ec are you going to destroy the company by doing that? If you do that, are you going to destroy the company? What you can do without breaking it up is make sure that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s more fair. They do treat me very badly. Oh, and he told me no way. You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re the No. 1 person on all of Google for stories. I mean \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which probably makes sense, to be honest with you. I hate (inaudible). Most of them are bad stories but these are minor details, right? Be \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s only bad because of the fake news, cause the news is really fake. We \u201a\u00c4\u00ec that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the one we really have to \u201a\u00c4\u00ec straighten it \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and we have to straighten out our press because we have a corrupt press.It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s all part of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2the weave\u201a\u00c4\u00f4If Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s answers seem long, they are. He hops from point to point, a hard-to-follow style he is proud of. At one point in the Bloomberg interview, Micklethwait tried to interrupt to ask a question as Trump pivoted from talking about the dollar to talking about the French president.TRUMP: You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve got to be able to finish a thought.MICKLETHWAIT: Yeah.TRUMP: Because it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s very important. You know, this is big stuff we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re talking about. You can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t go that quickly.MICKLETHWAIT: You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve gone from the dollar to (Emmanuel)Macron.TRUMP: So let me just tell you \u201a\u00c4\u00ec so I said \u201a\u00c4\u00ec no, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m just telling you basic \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s called the weave.

FormerPresident Donald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign also faced renewed focus on his legal troubles in the wake of a new filing by federal prosecutors, the survey finds.In the wake ofHurricane Helene, which has killed more than 230 people across the southeastern United States,\u00ac\u2020\u201a\u00c4\u00fahurricane\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 was the word most frequently mentioned when respondents were asked what they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d heard about Trump. It was\u00ac\u2020the second-most frequent word mentioned when they were asked about Vice President Kamala Harris, second only to \u201a\u00c4\u00facampaign.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The poll, conducted by SSRS and Verasight on behalf of a research team from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, was fielded from\u00ac\u2020October 4-7, beforeHurricane Miltonmade landfall in Florida on Wednesday night.Democrats and Republicans were about equally likely to mention the hurricane when talking about Harris \u201a\u00c4\u00ec although their perspectives on her response often differed sharply.Harris \u201a\u00c4\u00fawas working with FEMA on providing assistance and recovery for the areas affected by Hurricane Helene,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 one Democratic respondent wrote, while another credited her with having done \u201a\u00c4\u00faa great job of consoling hurricane victims in Georgia.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9By contrast, a Republican respondent wrote about hearing that\u00ac\u2020Harris \u201a\u00c4\u00fais only paying $750 to those whose homes are being devastated in the hurricanes, yet sending billions upon billions of dollars to Ukraine and Israel.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The $750 is an apparent reference to a payment program at the Federal Emergency Management Agencythat has been mischaracterized by Trump and others\u00ac\u2020as the only assistance FEMA is providing.Republicans were far likelier than Democrats to mention the hurricane in conjunction with Trump. When Democrats were asked what they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d recently heard about the GOP presidential\u00ac\u2020nominee, they were more likely than Republicans to mention his response to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, or simply use the word \u201a\u00c4\u00falie.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9In the latest set of data, Americans also mentioned the October 5 rally Trump held in Butler, Pennsylvania \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the site of the first assassination attempt against him this summer. And they referenced two other names in conjunction with him: Elon Musk, whoappeared onstage with Trump\u00ac\u2020in Butler,\u00ac\u2020and Jack Smith, the special counsel whoserecently unsealed legal brief\u00ac\u2020laid out the government\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sweeping case against the former president\u00ac\u2020for his effort to overturn the 2020 election.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgRoughly 14% of respondents who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d heard something about Trump\u00ac\u2020referenced words related to his\u00ac\u2020legal issues, up from 7% in the previous wave of data and the highest share to do so since early September, when the sentencing in his New York criminal case was delayed until after the 2024 election.Asked about Harris, 8% of respondents who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d heard something about her\u00ac\u2020mentioned words relating to endorsements \u201a\u00c4\u00ec in this case, largely a reference to Republican former Vice President Dick Cheney, who announced his support of her last month, and his daughter Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman\u00ac\u2020whorecently appeared with Harrison the campaign trail. Harris also previously saw bursts of attention after endorsements from Oprah Winfrey and Taylor Swift.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgThe sentiment behind the words Americans used to describe what they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d heard about Harris remained modestly more positive than the words they used to describe the news about Trump. This doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t mean that they expressed warmer feelings about Harris personally but that what they said about her tended to be framed in relatively positive terms and tone.

But some emerging trends in the data hint at warning signs for the vice president\u2019s campaign.The share of Americans hearing anything at all about Harris has dropped each week since her presidential debate with former PresidentDonald Trumpin early September, and during that same time, the tone Americans use in describing what they\u2019ve heard about her has grown more negative, reaching the lowest point of her campaign in the latest results.Looking at what people say they have heard, read or seen about Harris, \u201clie\u201d has emerged as a persistent top word that some Americans associate with her.\u00a0In the latest data, it was the fourth-most mentioned word after \u201cborder,\u201d \u201cpolls\u201d and \u201ccampaign.\u201d It ranked sixth in the previous week\u2019s data and second the week of theABC News presidential debate, after ranking no higher than 12th in earlier rounds of the survey and no higher than 20th prior to the Democratic convention in August.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgThe survey, conducted September 27-30 by SSRS and Verasight for research teams from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, measures what Americans say they have recently heard, read or seen about Harris and Trump.The share of Americans mentioning words such as \u201clie\u201d or \u201cliar\u201d when asked what they\u2019ve heard about Harris remains quite small \u2014 just 6% in the latest data, compared with 15% who mentioned something related to immigration, for example \u2014 but it has grown over time, rising from 3% or less prior to the Democratic convention to peak at 9% shortly after the debate.\u201cKamala says nothing,\u201d wrote one respondent included in the latest survey. \u201cShe uses a bunch of words that make no sense.

It marks the first time in the survey that multiple policy-related topics have landed in the top five for Harris, and the most recent data saw by far the most mentions for immigration-related words in relation to her campaign since she entered the race in late July.\u201cI have watched her speeches and appreciated her articulate explanation of her policies and positions on various things,\u201d another respondent wrote. \u201cHer concern for all and ability to concretely point to solutions to problems is a sharp contrast to Donald Trump.\u201dOn Trump\u2019s side, theassassination attemptsagainst him remain prominent in the public\u2019s attention, while immigration has faded a bit andhis meeting last monthwith Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky garnered attention.\u201cHe met with Zelensky and was not very enthusiastic about helping Ukraine,\u201d one respondent wrote.Responses calling the former president a liar are also persistently near the top of his list. About 8% in the latest data use the word \u201clie\u201d or \u201cliar\u201d in relation to Trump. That figure has frequently been in the high single digits as a share of topics about Trump since the start of the survey in June, dipping below that at times, including around the first assassination attempt against the former president and the Republican National Convention.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgAlthough responses about Harris are generally still less negative in tone than those about Trump, there has been a notable decline in overall sentiment in the Harris responses, while Trump\u2019s numbers have rebounded slightly following a post-debate drop. For Harris, the negative shift is apparent across parties, with sentiments expressed by Democrats, Republicans and independents all tilting slightly more negative in the new data than in the week prior. For Trump, though, sentiment has held steady among Republicans, while shifting slightly less negative than the previous survey among independents and Democrats.The latest poll found that just under two-thirds of Americans (64%) reported seeing, reading or hearing something about Harris, compared with 68% who said the same about Trump. It marks the fourth straight week in which more people reported hearing about Trump than they did about Harris, and it\u2019s a notable drop from the previous week in the shares saying they\u2019d heard about each candidate (Trump down 7 points, Harris down 5).The overall level of attention to the presidential candidates now is lower than it was at this point in previous cycles, though that may be a side effect of debate timing. In 2020, for example, more than 8 in 10 Americans reported having heard news about Trump and Joe Biden in the same week of that campaign, but there was a presidential debate held on September 29. In 2016, there was a mid-September dip in attention ahead of that year\u2019s first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton, held on September 26.\u201cIt has been relatively quiet this week,\u201d one respondent to the latest survey wrote when asked about Trump. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of anything.\u201dCNN\u2019s Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report.", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "CNN Instant Poll: No clear winner in VP debate between Tim Walz and JD Vance", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/politics/election-poll-walz-vance-debate/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Registered voters who watchedTuesday\u2019s debate between vice presidential nomineesTim Walz and JD Vance were closely divided over which candidate did the better job, according to aCNN instant poll of debate watchers conducted by SSRS, and the event left viewers with more positive views of both candidates than they held pre-debate.Among debate watchers, Walz remains the candidate who\u2019s seen more positively and as more in touch with their needs and vision for the country.

And practically none of the voters who tuned in saw the debate as a reason to change their votes.Viewers in the spin room watch the CBS News vice presidential debate on October 1 in New York.Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APRelated article36 key lines to explain the Vance-Walz vice presidential debateFollowing the debate, 51% of viewers said that Vance did the better job, with 49% picking Walz. In a survey conducted of the same voters prior to the debate, Walz held the advantage as the candidate they expected to perform more strongly, 54% to 45%.The closely divided opinions about the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s debate stand in sharp contrast to the more decisive audience reaction following this year\u2019s top-of-the-ticket debates. In June,two-thirds of debate watchersthought that formerPresident Donald TrumpoutperformedPresident Joe Biden, while a 63% majority who tuned in to the September debate between Trump andKamala Harrissaid thatthe vice president did the better job.Views of the vice presidential hopefuls split largely along pre-established political lines Tuesday night: 90% of debate watchers who support Trump\u2019s candidacy said\u00a0that Vance did the better job, while a slightly narrower 82% of the Harris supporters who tuned in saw Walz as the winner.The poll\u2019s results reflect opinions of the debate only among those voters who tuned in and aren\u2019t representative of the views of the full voting public. Debate watchers in the poll were 3 percentage points likelier to be Democratic-aligned than Republican-aligned, making for an audience that\u00a0was\u00a0about 5 points more Democratic-leaning than all registered voters nationally. That\u2019s a difference from the audience for the two presidential debates this year, both of which were slightly more GOP-leaning than the potential American electorate overall. What voters who don\u2019t tune in hear about an event\u00a0in the following days can often be as impactful as immediate views of the event itself.Following the debate, 59% of debate watchers said they had a favorable view of Walz, with just 22% viewing him unfavorably \u2013 an improvement from his already positive numbers among the same voters pre-debate (46% favorable, 32% unfavorable). Debate watchers came away from the debate\u00a0with roughly neutral views of Vance: 41% rated him favorably and 44% unfavorably. That\u2019s also an improvement from their image of Vance pre-debate, when his ratings among this group were deeply underwater (30% favorable, 52% unfavorable).Among debate watchers, Walz boosted his favorability far more among women than men, while Vance\u2019s gains were about the same among voters of both genders. About 1 in 5\u00a0Trump supporters (21%) who tuned in now say they have a favorable view of Walz, while Vance\u2019s favorability rating with Harris\u2019 supporters remains at just 8%.Ina CNN poll of all Americans taken prior to the debate, views of Walz were narrowly above water, with 36% of voters viewing him favorably, 32% unfavorably, and a sizable 33% saying they hadn\u2019t heard of him or had no opinion of him. By contrast, views of Vance tilted negative, with 30% of registered voters rating him favorably, 42% unfavorably, and 27% offering no opinion.A 65% majority of debate watchers now say Walz is qualified to serve as president if necessary, with 58% saying the same of Vance. Prior to the debate, 62% of the same voters thought Walz was qualified to assume the presidency if needed and 50% that Vance was qualified to do so.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen.

The share of viewers who said that both vice presidential hopefuls are in touch with their problems is twice as large as the share who said\u00a0that neither is, 12% to 6% \u2013 a level of positivity unusual in this year\u2019s election cycle.There\u2019s a significant gender gap among viewers over which candidate more closely shares their vision for America: Among female voters, Walz has the clear advantage, with half saying he does compared with\u00a0the 36% who see Vance\u2019s vision as closer to theirs. Male voters split more evenly, 47% Walz to 43% Vance.Viewers said\u00a0by a narrow margin, 37% to 33%, that Vance did a better job than Walz in defending his running mate, with 27% saying that each candidate did an equally good job, and 3% that neither did. Seven in 10 Trump supporters said\u00a0Vance did the better job defending his running mate, while 57% of Harris backers said\u00a0Walz did best on that.A negligible 1% of voters who tuned into the debate said it had changed their mind\u00a0about whom to vote for, with Harris and Trump supporters equally unlikely to view the event as decisive.The CNN poll was conducted by text message with 574 registered US voters who said they watched the debate Tuesday, and the poll findings are representative of the views of debate watchers only.

That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a shift from late August and early September, when roughly equal shares recalled hearing news about each of the candidates.Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to mention the word \u201a\u00c4\u00faassassination\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and other phrases surrounding the attempt on Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s life, such as references to the golf course where the attempt took place.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.org\u201a\u00c4\u00faDonald Trump has been out on the campaign trail and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s getting dangerous for him.

But it may also reflect differences in the news stories that resonate more with each group \u201a\u00c4\u00ee as well the way partisans on each side are likely to describe those stories when asked, which often reflects their own political sentiments.Asked what they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d seen, read or heard about Harris, meanwhile, Americans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 responses included the word \u201a\u00c4\u00fadebate\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee a reference both to her performance in her first presidential debate and her stated willingness for a rematch against Trump \u201a\u00c4\u00ee as well asher interview with Oprah Winfrey.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgThe sentiment behind the words Americans used to describe what they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d heard about Harris remained more positive than the words they used to describe the news about Trump.

But in the Omaha-area seat, Harris takes 20% support among those who disapprove of Biden, while in North Carolina, that ticks downward to 14%.The vast majority of likely voters in both North Carolina and Nebraska\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2nd District say they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re at least somewhat confident that votes in their state will be accurately cast and counted in this year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presidential election.

Yet the poll suggests that Black likely voters currently supporting Trump or third-party candidates are not as locked into their choices as those Black likely voters who back the vice president.CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s latest poll finds Harris leading Trump by 63 points among Black likely voters, 79% to 16%. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a considerable improvement over Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 46-point advantage over Trump among registered voters in CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s June poll, which was its last with the president at the top of the ticket. But that advantage falls short of the Biden-Harris campaign\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 75-point margin among Black voters, according toexit polls from 2020.Since Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 entrance into the race, enthusiasm among Black voters about the election appears to have grown. In the latest poll, 79% of Black registered voters say they would definitely vote, up from 68% in the June poll. For voters overall, that stood at 82% in the latest poll, about the same as in June. Black voters now are just as likely as other voters to say it is extremely important that they, personally, vote (both at 63%), while in June, Black registered voters were less likely to say the same (57% among Black voters, 66% overall).Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 improvement over Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s margins from earlier this year comes as the poll finds broad support for her from the 40% of Black likely voters who view Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presidency as a failure \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Harris leads Trump 65% to 31% among these voters.The poll suggests Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s improvements among Black voters relative to 2020 are driven largely by Black voters under the age of 60. Harris leads among Black voters aged 60 and over by 87 points, almost identical to Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 85-point margin in 2020, according to exit polls for the same group. This shrinks to a 55-point lead for Harris among Black voters younger than 60 (Biden won this group by 71 points in 2020, according to exit polls). Trump performs best among Black likely voters younger than 40, with 22% support.President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign rally at Girard College on May 29, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/FileStill, CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s poll suggests that Harris has the potential to improve her margins. Her supporters are broadly locked in and unlikely to shift in the race \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 92% of Black likely voters who support Harris say their minds are already made up. But among those backing other candidates, a third say they may yet change their mind.Harris is also generally viewed more favorably among Black registered voters compared with registered voters overall, even after accounting for Black voters\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 overwhelming Democratic lean. Nearly 8 in 10 Black voters view Harris favorably, and Black Democrats view Harris slightly more positively than others in the party, while Black voters outside the Democratic Party offer far more positive views of her than do independents or Republicans of other races.Black voters who don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t consider themselves Democrats are more likely than non-Democrats of other racial backgrounds to say that Harris has improved their view of the Democratic Party; that they would be proud or excited if she wins the election; and that her views are generally mainstream, with Black Democratic voters offering similar or modestly more positive views than others in their party. Among non-Democrats, Black voters also rate Harris as more aligned with their vision of a president than do other voters across all the attributes tested in the poll, including temperament, ability to understand the problems of people like themselves and leadership skills.That carries over to views of Trump too. Non-Democratic Black voters are more likely to view Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presidency as a failure than other voters who share their partisan perspective and are less likely to trust Trump over Harris on handling each of the issues tested in the poll, including the economy and immigration.While Black likely voters are largely focused on the same issues as the broader electorate, the CNN polling does find some differences among Democrats. Black likely voters are just as likely as all other groups to consider the economy their top issue (41%). Democratic Black likely voters, however, are twice as likely as Democratic likely voters overall to consider the economy their top issue (42%, compared with 19%). Democratic Black likely voters are also less apt than Democratic likely voters overall to say that protecting democracy or abortion and reproductive rights are their top issue.When asked which economic issue is most important to them, Black voters across the political spectrum are generally aligned with the overall electorate and put inflation at the top of the list. But Black likely voters are more likely than other voters to name jobs and wages as the top economic issue and less likely to say federal spending.Nearly 9 in 10 Black registered voters say the political system in the United States is in need of a major overhaul or major reforms, and a large majority (85%) say that the federal government does not do enough for Black Americans. Roughly half of Black voters (47%) say that the federal government does both too much for White Americans and too little for Black Americans. Still, Black registered voters are more likely than the broader electorate to say that they are satisfied with the influence people like themselves have on the political process (52%, compared with 38% overall).The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS online and by telephone September 19-22, 2024, among 2,074 registered voters nationwide drawn from a probability-based panel. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s election.

But he has repeatedly returned to the issue \u2013 talking up his support for IVF \u2013 on the campaign trail, where he has given a long series of confusing or contradictory answers about his stance on abortion.\u201cWe really are the party for IVF,\u201d Trump told moderator and Fox News host Harris Faulkner on \u201cThe Faulkner Focus.\u201d \u201cWe want fertilization, and it\u2019s all the way, and the Democrats tried to attack us on it, and we\u2019re out there on IVF, even more than them. So, we\u2019re totally in favor.\u201dIn vitro fertilization, an expensive, decades-old treatment used by millions of parents, became a flashpoint in the nationwide clash over abortion and reproductive rights earlier this year whenAlabama\u2019s Supreme Courtsaid that frozen embryos are children and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death.The Alabama ruling infuriated reproductive rights advocates who reasoned it would have a chilling effect on IVF, scaring off doctors who perform the procedure and sending prices even higher. It also set off a political firestorm that ultimately sent the state\u2019s Republican-led Legislature scrambling to pass a bill giving civil and criminal immunity to providers and patients.Lab staff prepare small petri dishes, each holding several 1-7 day old embryos, for cells to be extracted from each embryo to test for viability at the Aspire Houston Fertility Institute in vitro fertilization lab Tuesday, Feb. 27, 2024, in Houston.Michael Wyke/APRelated articleSenate GOP blocks IVF bill again as Democrats spotlight issue ahead of electionsTrump and Republicans quickly distanced themselves from the Alabama case, but Democrats, led by Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign, have argued that the ruling offered a preview of the policies Trump would seek to enact if he returned to the White House.\u201cDonald Trump called himself \u2018the father of IVF.\u2019 What is he talking about?\u201d the vice presidentposted on social medialate Tuesday. \u201cHis abortion bans have already jeopardized access to it in states across the country \u2014 and his own platform could end IVF altogether.\u201dSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, Harris said she found Trump\u2019s comments to be \u201cbizarre\u201d and said he should instead be taking responsibility for the climate around abortion rights in the US.\u201cI\u2019m going to say what I\u2019ve said publicly and what I\u2019ve said many times based on my observations. \u2026 Donald Trump is increasingly unstable, and as has been said by people who have worked closely with him even when he was president, he\u2019s unfit to be president of the United States,\u201d she said.In the aftermath of the Alabama decision, Trump claimed he would enact a federal policymaking IVF free of charge. He did not say how he would go about doing so or whether the government or insurers would foot the bill.Senate Democrats, keen to highlight the issue ahead of the election, have twice this year brought up a bill that would guarantee access to IVF nationwide \u2013 with Republicansvoting to block the measureeach time. Many of those GOP opponents have said they do support IVF but criticized the legislation as unnecessary overreach and a political show vote.During the town hall, Trump also criticized some states for placing restrictions on abortion that he called \u201ctoo tough,\u201d saying, without providing any details, that those laws are \u201cgoing to be redone.\u201d\u201cThe states are now voting (on abortion rights), and honestly, some of them are going much more liberal, like in Ohio,\u201d Trump said.Faulkner then noted that \u201csome of (the states) are not,\u201dreferring to the statesthat enacted or activated bans or restrictions on the procedure after Roe was overturned in 2022 and where those limits remain in place.\u201cAnd some of them are not, but it\u2019s going to be redone,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be redone. They\u2019re going to, you\u2019re going to end up with a vote of the people. And some of them, I agree, they\u2019re too tough, too tough.\u201dStill, Trump again touted his role in appointing Supreme Court justices who struck down Roe v. Wade and argued that the issue should be left to the states to legislate. He also expressed support for exceptions to abortion bans in the case of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger.After previously refusing to commit either way, Trump earlier this month said he would veto a federal abortion ban.

West VirginiaSen. Joe ManchinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/FileWest Virginia is essentially out of reach for Democrats, who had little chance of holding this seat without Sen. Joe Manchin running for reelection. Manchin, now an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is likely to be succeeded by Republican Jim Justice, the state\u2019s two-term governor.Justice has had his share of negative headlines, but in a state poised to back Trump by a significant margin, it\u2019s hard to see a world in which Republicans don\u2019t pick up this open seat.2. MontanaSen. Jon TesterAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileDemocrat Jon Tester, who\u2019s running for a fourth term in a state Trump has twice carried by double digits, remains the most vulnerable Senate incumbent this year. Republicans feel confident their nominee,Tim Sheehy, has an edge \u2013 and both Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales and the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter have shifted their rating of the once toss-up race toward the GOP.Democrats still see a path to victory for Tester, who has a proven history of defying the partisan lean of his state by communicating both what he\u2019s done for Montanans and painting a contrast with his opponents.Democrats are trying that playbook against Sheehy, trying to define the wealthy businessman and retired Navy SEAL, who moved to Montana in 2014, as an out-of-state carpetbagger who cannot be trusted. Recentlyunearthed audio recordingsof Sheehy using racist stereotypes to refer to Native Americans has played into that message, with Democrats arguing that he\u2019s alienating a crucial demographic in the state. In a debate earlier this week, Sheehy acknowledged his comments were \u201cinsensitive,\u201d saying, \u201cI come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color sometimes.\u201dTester\u2019s campaign is now leaning into abortion rights on the airwaves \u2013 an issue that\u2019s on the ballot in Montana this year. Arecent adfeatures a self-described \u201clife-long\u201d Republican woman arguing that Sheehy \u201cwants to take away personal freedoms.\u201dBut Republicans are invoking transgender issues in an attempt to cast Tester as a liberal who\u2019s been changed by his years in Washington, while Sheehy istrying to tie Tester to KamalaHarris\u2013 especially on immigration. Tester \u2013 who has not endorsed in the presidential race \u2013 tried to meet those attacks during their debate by pointing out that Sheehy would not have supported this year\u2019s bipartisan border bill that Republicans blocked.3. OhioSen. Sherrod BrownBonnie Cash/Getty Images/FileDemocratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing his toughest reelection in a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 points. Public polling still shows the three-term senator ahead of GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, although that is expected to tighten as more Republican voters come home to Moreno. Brown was at 47% to Moreno\u2019s 43% in a late SeptemberNew York Times/Siena College pollamong likely Ohio voters \u2013 not far outside the margin of error. But the reassuring news for Democrats: Brown was winning 10% of Trump voters.Democrats have seized on Moreno\u2019s recent comments at a town hall suggesting that some suburban women were single-issue voters when it comes to abortion and questioning why women over 50 would care about the topic. Brown pointed to the remarks as evidence that his opponent is out of step with the 57% of Ohio voters who last year approved a ballot measure protecting reproductive rights. WinSenate, a Democratic outside group, also launcheda new adwith a woman talking about the emergency abortion she underwent at 25 for an ectopic pregnancy, saying, \u201cOur lives don\u2019t belong in Bernie Moreno\u2019s hands.\u201d(Moreno\u2019s campaign said in a statement that he was \u201cclearly making a tongue-in-cheek joke about how Sherrod Brown and members of the leftwing media like to pretend that the only issue that matters to women voters is abortion,\u201d and that Moreno believes women \u201ccare just as much about the economy, rising prices, crime and our open southern border as male voters do.\u201d)The Senate contest in Ohio ranked as the most expensive congressional race on record, as of October 3, with total ad spending from both parties this cycle, including future reservations, exceeding $446 million, according to AdImpact.

Debbie StabenowAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileMichigan remains the most competitive open seat on this list. Democrat Elissa Slotkin has held a narrow edge in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, but the absence of an incumbent and the competitiveness of the presidential race in the Wolverine State\u00a0makes it one that could come down to the wire.Slotkin, a third-term congresswoman, led Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers 47% to 42% among likely voters in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll, with Slotkin drawing 6% of likely voters who also said they would vote for Trump. Slotkin has a strong fundraising record \u2013 her campaign announced raising $18 million in the third quarter \u2013 but Republicans are pouring more money into this state, with the Senate Leadership Fund recently announcing a $22.5 million investment.Slotkin has been runningads on abortion\u2013 an issue that has helped propel recent Democratic victories in the state. Herspotsclaim that Rogers\u2019 past support for abortion restrictions makes him untrustworthy on the issue now. \u201cI\u2019m scared that Mike Rogers will continue to take away my rights,\u201d says one woman in a spot who says she needed an abortion to save her life.Rogers has been responding on air, speaking directly to camera while holding hands with his wife inone new spot,saying he respects Michigan voters\u2019 decision on abortion rights and \u201cwon\u2019t do anything to change it\u201d in the Senate.Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, scored the endorsement of the state Farm Bureau\u2019s PAC, which had previously backed Stabenow (the chair of the Senate Agriculture panel). Rogers, whom Democrats have attacked for living in Florida after he left Congress a decade ago, is runningspotsthat tout his Michigan roots and public service. Rogers and Republicans are alsoattacking Slotkinandthe Biden administrationover plans to support the building of electric vehicles, using the misleading term \u201cmandate.\u201d5. PennsylvaniaSen. Bob CaseyAndrew Harnik/Getty ImagesDemocratic Sen. Bob Casey\u2019s race against Republican challenger Dave McCormick moves two spots up on the list in light of heavy GOP outside spending, some tighter polling and the competitiveness of the presidential race in a\u00a0state that is part of Democrats\u2019 so-called blue wall of must-win states.September polling from Marist, Quinnipiac University, the New York Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer, Franklin & Marshall, CBS News/YouGov and Fox News all gave Casey anywhere from a 5- to 9-point lead among likely voters. Polls from CNN and The Washington Post around the same time, however, showed no clear leader.The two candidates, who met on the debate stage for the first time Thursday night, have been hitting the airwaves with competing messages, as have their allied outside groups. Democrats are going after McCormick onabortion,includingonead that features footage of him referring to himself as \u201cpro-life.\u201d The Senate Leadership Fund, which is adding $28 million to GOP sending here, and the pro-McCormickKeystone Renewal PAChave been attacking Casey over inflation andimmigration.McCormick\u2019s tenure as the CEO of FreeMarkets \u2013 a Pittsburgh-based software company \u2013 has also been featured in ads on both sides.The Democratic group WinSenateis accusing him ofoutsourcing jobsand pointing to his management of the company to argue that \u201cConnecticut Dave\u201d\u00a0 \u2013 he owns a home in the Nutmeg State \u2013 \u201cwants to buy our Senate seat.\u201d McCormick is running ads featuringformer FreeMarkets employeespraising him and touting the company\u2019s hiring policies.6. WisconsinSen. Tammy BaldwinMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesWisconsin also moves up two spots on the list amid signs that some Republicans could be drifting home toward their party\u2019s nominee, Eric Hovde, in his challenge to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.The two-term senator maintained a modest edge over Hovde in aMarquette University Law School pollreleased this week \u2013 51% to 45% among likely voters when third-party candidates are included and 53% to 46% in a head-to-head matchup. Baldwin had a similar 7-point lead in aNew York Times/Siena College surveyof the two-person race\u00a0taken around the same time.While Baldwin has repeatedly outraised Hovde, the Senate Leadership Fund is also pouring funds \u2013 $17 million \u2013 into the Badger State, and Hovde has plenty of his own money to pay for ads at the lower candidate rate if he chooses. (We\u2019ll be eying his third-quarter fundraising filing for details about how much the Sunwest Bank CEO had loaned his campaign through September.) Ads from Hovde \u2013 whose campaign recently underwent a shakeup \u2013 havesought to tie Baldwinto Harris, attacking her over border security, fentanyl andtransgender rights.But Baldwin, who\u2019s made an effort tovisit the red, rural parts of Wisconsin, has a well-defined brand. She picked up theendorsementof the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation this week \u2013 a notable get for a Democrat running statewide. Much of Democratic advertising has played up Hovde\u2019s past controversial comments and sought to cast him as a California carpetbagger \u2013 he owns property in Laguna Beach, even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin and his family\u2019s company is a prominent state brand.7. ArizonaSen. Kyrsten SinemaAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileArizona is a conservative-leaning purple state, where Republicans should ordinarily be able to pick off a Senate seat \u2013 especially an open one. But in the race to replace retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, Republican candidate Kari Lake seems to have hit a ceiling.The 2022 gubernatorial nominee is well known in the state, but not necessarily for the right reasons. She still refuses to accept her loss for governor and, despite tethering herself to Trump, is underperforming his polling numbers.Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego led Lake by 10 points among likely voters in aMarist polland 13 points in aFox News survey, both from mid-September. Lake was polling behind Trump in both surveys by 6 points and 8 points respectively.Lake and the NRSC areblaming Gallegofor inflation and immigration \u2013 pointing to his support for what they\u2019re calling the \u201cKamala Inflation Act.\u201d (Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.) And while the Senate Leadership Fund hasn\u2019t spent here, a Club for Growth-affiliated group is also airingattackson the congressman. Gallego, a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was on the airwaves for months introducing himself to voters statewide as a Marine veteran and istouting his supportfrom law enforcement andRepublican voters. He announced raising $21.7 million in the third quarter.8. NevadaSen. Jacky RosenAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileNevada moves down two spots on the list as Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen appears to be in a stronger position against Republican opponent Sam Brown in a state where Democratic prospects seem to have picked up since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.Rosen, who appeared at a Harris rally in Las Vegas earlier this week, led Brown by 10 points in aCNN pollin late August. Like Lake in Arizona, Brown \u2013 an Army veteran who first ran for office in Texas and lost the GOP primary for Nevada\u2019s other Senate seat last year \u2013 also appears to be running up against a ceiling.Rosen and Democrats are hitting Brownover his previous stances on abortion\u2013 which is on the ballot this year in Nevada. Brown, who says he supports current state law legalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks, has said he\u2019d \u201cclose the door\u201d on backing a national abortion ban.Rosen has had a fundraising edge over her opponent, and this week, national Republicans canceled their remaining independent expenditures in the state in favor of running hybrid ads with Brown, which allows them to benefit from the lower candidate rate in the ultra-pricey Las Vegas media market \u2014 a strategy they\u2019ve employed in races across the country to try to compete with well-funded Democratic candidates on the airwaves.9. TexasSen. Ted CruzTierney L. Cross/Getty Images/FileNational Democrats\u2019 decision toinvest TV resourcesin Texas was the first major signal the party is putting money where its mouth is on the competitiveness of the Lone Star State this year. Democrats see Republican Sen. Ted Cruz as unpopular and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred, as the man to beat him, even in a state that is still comfortably red at the presidential level.The first hybridadbetween Allred and the DSCC features Kate Cox, the woman who had to leave the state to seek an abortion after her fetus had been diagnosed with a deadly condition, and Amanda Zurawski, who sued the state after she was denied an abortion when experiencing complications. \u201cIf you\u2019re experiencing pregnancy complications in Texas, you\u2019re in danger,\u201d Zurawski says in the ad, \u201cand it\u2019s Ted Cruz and the anti-abortion extremists\u2019 fault.\u201dAllred has also tried to flip the script on Republicans byaccusing Cruzof \u201cdoing nothing to secure the border.\u201d Cruz, in turn, isattacking Allredover a vote related to the inclusion of transgender athletes in women\u2019s sports. \u201cBoys and girls are different,\u201d is how anotheradfrom the Republican opens. \u201cThis election is about keeping Texas Texas,\u201d Cruz has said.Cruz only beat Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke by 3 points in 2018. But Democrats hope that Allred, a former NFL player who flipped a Dallas-area House seat the same year, is a more formidable challenger and can turn out more minority voters. (Allred would be the state\u2019s first Black senator if he wins.)Even Republicans acknowledge that Allred is running a good race, and the NRSC is investing here to help Cruz and the state party. Still, Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, so this remains an uphill battle for Allred.10. MarylandSen. Ben CardinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/GettyImages/FileThe race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin remains in tenth place this month as Angela Alsobrooks fights to keep this seat in party hands. Joe Biden won Maryland by 33 points in 2020, but Republican nominee Larry Hogan \u2013 a popular former two-term governor \u2013 has a supportive super PAC committing $18 million to tout hisindependence.Alsobrooks, the Prince George\u2019s County executive, led Hogan by 11 points in a recentWashington Post/University of Maryland poll. She\u2019s become better known statewide and has made gains among voters who say they care about Democrats maintaining control of the Senate. The argument that Hogan would be another vote for Senate Republicans has been Democrats\u2019central pitchin deep-blue Maryland, especially onabortion rightsand Trump.Voters in the Post survey were split over whether Hogan would back his party\u2019s leaders in the Senate. He\u2019s winning nearly half of independents, as well as 18% of Democrats.

Wade in 2022, eliminating the national right to an abortion.Most of the proposed ballot measures aim to enshrine the right to an abortion in state constitutions.\u00ac\u2020They follow a series of restrictivetrigger lawsthat went into effect following the Dobbs decision, along with abortion policies that were handed down by politicians or decided by state supreme courts since the decision.Anti-abortion organizers backed a handful of initiatives aimed at restricting abortion access, thoughsimilar restrictive measures have failedin the few states where votes have been held in the past couple of years.Abortion measures on the ballot in NovemberTen states \u201a\u00c4\u00ee\u00ac\u2020Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and South Dakota \u201a\u00c4\u00ee have already secured abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. All eyes are on Florida, which has served as a critical access point for people seeking services in a region of the country that is fast becoming anabortion care desert. A six-week abortion banreplaced the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 15-week banon May 1.Nebraska Secretary of State Robert Evnen announced in August that for the first time in the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s history, two conflicting petition efforts made the same ballot.Now voters in Nebraska will voteon whether abortion rights will be enshrined in the constitution or whether the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s current 12-week ban will be preserved.In this May 2023 photo, hundreds of people gather at the Nebraska Capitol to protest against a proposed abortion ban.Margery Beck/APRelated articleNebraska ballot can include competing measures to expand or limit abortion rights, high court rulesAfter organizers secured the New York Equal Rights Amendment on the 2024 ballot, it was briefly struck from the ballot by a state judge. State Attorney General Letitia James appealed that decision, and a state appeals court restored the measure to the ballot in June.A measure in Missouri\u00ac\u2020that\u00ac\u2020seeks to broadly protect reproductive care\u00ac\u2020has made it onto the ballot, while\u00ac\u2020an opposing\u00ac\u2020measure to permanently ban abortion never made it out of the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s legislative session.States with potential abortion ballot measuresOrganizers in states across the country have continued to work to secure funding, gather signatures and jump through the legal hoops necessary to secure abortion measures on the 2024 ballot.In most states, the process entails collecting a certain number of signatures by a designated deadline, while others require the additional step of having the ballot language approved by a state court, according to campaign organizers. The abortion rights measures are largely backed by coalitions of reproductive health advocates, many of which have fundraised to secure the money to support the campaigns.Organizers in Arkansas collected and submitted signatures for a proposed abortion rights measure, but the Secretary of State rejected their petition, saying the organizers did not correctly submit paperwork regarding paid canvassers. The state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s supreme court sided with the secretary, ensuring the measure will not be on the ballot this November.Lawmaker proposed measures in Iowa and Missouri to restrict or exclude the right to abortion in state constitutions did not make it out of legislative sessions. Lawmakers in Pennsylvania proposed a measure barring the use of public funding for abortions, which is unlikely to pass the state legislature.States that have voted on abortion post-DobbsSeven states have already seen a vote on abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and reproductive health advocates have been heartened by the overwhelming support for abortion access among voters. Every measure aimed at protecting abortion access has passed, while all measures to restrict it have failed.While support for abortion access is considered a given in states like California, organizers say these votes offer an important layer of legal protection for patients and providers \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and send a message to elected officials about what voters want.CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Molly English contributed to this report.", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "What happens if there\u2019s a tie in 2024?

Kennedy Jr.suspended his presidential campaign, he did it in the most complicated way.Get your head around this: Kennedy will take himself off the ballot in certain key states, but he is encouraging supporters to vote for him in safe red and blue states so that he can feature in a \u201a\u00c4\u00facontingent election\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 if former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris tie.In the battleground states, Kennedy said he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s supporting Trump.Could Kennedy actually feature in a \u201a\u00c4\u00facontingent election?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Short answer: No. He could not take part unless he won electoral votes, something that does not seem to be mathematically possible. Perhaps he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s envisioning an elector going rogue and supporting him in defiance of voters, but Kennedy did not share details of his thinking.For the facts about contingent elections, read on.With two presidential candidates fighting over a mere 538 Electoral College votes, a tie scenario is more than possible. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s actually kind of surprising there has only been one tied election so far, in 1800, between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.That tie was the result of a failure of coordination by Democratic-Republicans, but it led to the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first \u201a\u00c4\u00facontingent election,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 decided in the House of Representatives.Could a tie actually happen this year?Yes. While a tie is not a likely outcome, it is something to be ready for. Here is one plausible scenario for the 2024 election:If Harris wins Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada and a single electoral vote in Nebraska, all of which Joe Biden won in 2020, but she loses Pennsylvania and Georgia, there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a tie, 269-269.The website270 to Winalso has more tied-election scenarios.Unlike every other state, Maine and Nebraska award two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner of each congressional district. Those individual, competitive electoral votes in Maine and Nebraska become hugely consequential in potential tie scenarios.Make your own 269-269 scenario withCNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s interactive election map.What happens if there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a tie?If there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a 269-269 tie, or if a third party or independent candidate wins electoral votes and keeps a candidate from reaching an Electoral College majority of 270, the next step is the same. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s called a \u201a\u00c4\u00facontingent election.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9According to the12th Amendment, enacted in the wake of that divisive 1800 election, if no candidate gets a majority of the Electoral College votes, the new Congress, which would have just been sworn in on January 3, chooses the president. The Senate would choose the vice president.When would a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2contingent election\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 occur?According to an analysis by theCongressional Research Service, a contingent election would occur on January 6, immediately after members of Congress met to count electoral votes and determined that no candidate had a majority.There is a lot of information from that CRS report in this story. While it dates back to 2017, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s still a valuable resource.How would the process work?The nation would clearly be divided. Lawmakers could be torn between supporting their preferred candidate and the one their state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s voters preferred.In a contingent election, the House selects the president and the Senate selects the vice president. House members can only choose from among the top three finishers in the Electoral College for president, and senators can choose from among the top two finishers for vice president. Kennedy would presumably need to win electoral votes \u201a\u00c4\u00ec win a state or a congressional district in Nebraska or Maine \u201a\u00c4\u00ec in order to be an option in a contingent election. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no chance of that happening at the moment.Rather than voting as individuals, each state delegation in the House would get one vote, although how the state delegations select their preferred candidate is not spelled out.A simple majority, 26 state delegation votes, would appoint the new president.If state delegations in the House did not select a president by Inauguration Day, January 20, the new vice president selected by the Senatewould become temporary president. It is possible the Senate could select a vice president when the House is deadlocked, because in the Senate each senator would get one vote.If the Senate had not selected a vice president by January 20, the presidential succession plan in the 20th Amendment temporarily takes effect. First in line after the vice president is the speaker of the House, currently Mike Johnson, although it could be a different Republican or a Democrat if Democrats win a majority in the House this November.Does either side have an advantage?If the Electoral College already benefits smaller and more rural states, the contingent election process \u201a\u00c4\u00ec in which each state, regardless of population, has an equal vote \u201a\u00c4\u00ec gives them a huge advantage.California and Texas get the same say as Delaware and Wyoming in a contingent election. Plus, Washington, DC, which gets three votes in the Electoral College, would be cut out of the contingent election.There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nothing to require state delegations to honor the winner of their state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote. And in closely divided states, the results in single seats, perhaps determined by gerrymandered congressional maps, could swing a delegation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote.CNNRelated articleWhat to expect in the sprint to Election Day \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and beyondHeading into the 2024 election, Republican lawmakers held a majority in 26 states, compared with Democrats, who held the majority in 22, with ties in Minnesota and North Carolina. Republicans in North Carolina have changed the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s congressional map, however, and it is likely to have a majority-Republican congressional delegation in January. Republicans are likely to maintain\u00ac\u2020their advantage next year, especially if voters are so split that they deliver a national tie at the top of the ticket.In Arizona, for instance, who is to say that a potential majority of Republican members of Congresswould vote for the Democratic candidate, even if Harris pulled out a narrow win there?Would Alaska\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Democratic member of Congress, assuming she wins reelection, vote for the Democrat for president even though her state is likely to go for Trump in November?Why does this bizarre tie-break system exist?It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s actually meant to be an improvement. The way the Electoral College was first assembled, electors voted for two candidates. Whoever got the most votes was president and whoever got the second-most votes was vice president.By the time political parties were forming \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Federalists and Democratic-Republicans in 1800 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec electors needed to coordinate to cast more votes for their presidential pick than their vice presidential pick.In the1800 election, a rematch of 1796, Jefferson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Democratic-Republicans beat incumbent President and Federalist John Adams.But the Democratic-Republicans were poorly coordinated or bad at counting and foolishly cast equal numbers of votes for their presidential pick, Jefferson, and his running mate, Burr.Out of pique, when the early version of the contingent election rolled around, the Federalists, who still controlled the House at that time, backed Burr. Despite the intervention of Alexander Hamilton, a noted Federalist, it took 36 rounds of voting to finally elect Jefferson.By 1804, the 12th Amendment was being ratified.Has a contingent election happened in the years since the tied election of 1800?Yes.In 1824, multiple candidates got votes in the Electoral College but none of them received a majority, triggering a contingent election.Amazingly, from today\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s perspective, all of the candidates who got Electoral College votes that year were from the same Democratic-Republican political party, although they were split into regional sects.Andrew Jackson won 40% of the popular vote and got the most votes in the Electoral College with 99 of the 131needed for victory. But the House ultimately picked his top rival, John Quincy Adams, whose father lost that 1800 election.Jackson would have his revenge with a victory four years later, and John Quincy Adams would round out his career as the only former president to be elected to Congress, the body that made him president.Another contingent election occurred with the 1836 race, but just for vice president. Virginia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s electors did not like Robert M. Johnson, the running mate of election winner Martin Van Buren, and withheld their votes for him in the Electoral College. The Senate later elevated Johnson to the vice presidency in a contingent election.What about the disputed election of 1876?In 1876, when there was a contested outcome, the contingent election system was bypassed.That year, at the height of Reconstruction, the issue was not that no person got a majority in the Electoral College, but rather that three Southern states \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina \u201a\u00c4\u00ec sent multiple slates of electoral votes to Washington, DC, after the state elections were disputed. And in Oregon, there was a dispute over one elector.Congress created a special bipartisan commission, with one more Republican than Democrats, to determine which candidate should get the 20 disputed electoral votes. They ultimately gave the votes to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes even though Democrat Samuel Tilden got more popular votes.Hayes thenlargely ended Reconstruction, perhaps as part of a secret deal that gave him the White House.This story has been updated with additional developments.", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "What to expect in the sprint to Election Day \u2013 and beyond", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/politics/election-2024-key-dates-dg/index.html", "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s What Matters newsletter.

Those states \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u201a\u00c4\u00ec could again be the focus in 2024 when Harris, who turns 60 in October, takes on Trump.It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s important to be sure you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re registered to vote as soon as possible, which can usually be done online.

Now, he is as excited to vote for Harris as he is to knock doors organizing for her and other Democrats.\u201cAt the time, I was like kind of iffy, feeling like everybody else, kind of undecided,\u201d Johnson said of his choices before Harris got in the race. \u201cBut now that Kamala got the ball and she rollin\u2019 with it,\u00a0I feel like oh yeah. \u2026\u00a0She\u2019s making a good image for herself and for the Democrats.\u201dA year ago, Lang was blunt about Biden\u2019s struggles in Milwaukee\u2019s Black neighborhoods.

But young voters\u2019 level of support is a big question for 2024 because of anger and disappointment with how the Biden-Harris administration has handledthe Israel-Hamas conflict.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any blame to put on young people or people of color or Muslim voters in this election cycle, and I quite frankly don\u2019t really want to hear about that,\u201d Gray said in an interview. \u201cI think that you got to put that on campaigns, and you have to put that on the elected officials that are running for office. I sure hope she doesn\u2019t come up short in Michigan, because I don\u2019t really want to be talking to people about how young people should have done more when I feel like we\u2019re doing a lot.\u201dThe conversation with Gray and Anushka Jalisatgi, also co-president of the College Democrats last school year, was our third in 11 months. Both are part of a CNN project, calledAll Over the Map, designed to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are part of crucial voting blocs.In the twoprior conversations, both said Biden\u2019s age was a concern for many young voters who felt little connection to the octogenarian president. Now, with Harris as the Democratic nominee, the energy and enthusiasm difference is obvious.Gray now works as a digital organizer for a progressive group.\u201cI have noticed a significant shift in activity, across the board,\u201d Gray said.Jalisatgi is back on campus as a first-year law student, and just switched her voter registration to Michigan.\u201cA lot of my out-of-state friends are switching their registration to Michigan because it is a battleground state,\u201d Jalisatgi said.The voting hub at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.CNNAnd while Gray and Jalisatgi have moved on, the College Democrats are in high gear for election crunch time. A Harris campaign official stopped by a meeting during our latest visit and a crowded room of students spent time phone banking after getting a pep talk from the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer.\u201cThe work that you are doing is so important and I am energized by what I see happening with all these Dem clubs on campuses. You are kicking a**. So, we just got to keep rolling through,\u201d Whitmer said over a video link.Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell stopped by in person, and warned against overconfidence.\u201cI\u2019m going to look you all in the eye and tell you, neither candidate is winning in Michigan right now.\u201dNo encampment on campus, but tensions still high over Israel-Hamas conflictThe almost everywhere-you-look focus on registration and early voting at the Ann Arbor campus is remarkable.One registration table we stopped by on our latest visit was in a familiar spot: on the same campus path where students last semester built an encampment to air their grievances at Israel, at the Biden administration and at school officials they were pushing to divest from companies that do business with Israel.The school will not allow a new encampment, so it is harder to gauge how much the raw anger of last semester has carried over to the new school year \u2013 and into voting decisions.\u201cA lot of that energy, because it can\u2019t happen in a physical space \u2013 it\u2019s still occupying a lot of online space,\u201d Gray said.Jalisatgi sees it directed less at Harris and more at university officials.\u201cPeople still very much care that this is ongoing and that the university is complicit in contributing to it,\u201d Jalisatgi said. \u201cI\u2019m seeing universities putting out a lot of new free speech guidelines, new regulations for how they want to curb free speech or how they want to regulate it.\u201dUniversity of Michigan student Max Scheske walks with John King on campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan.CNNThe Ann Arbor College Republicans would not let CNN into a meeting they held during our recent visit.Member Max Scheske, a junior, said attendance and energy are up some as the election draws close. But he also said the group was pretty evenly divided when it comes to enthusiasm forDonald Trump.\u201cWe certainly do have our, you know, \u2018Trump is basically Jesus\u2019 wing of the club,\u201d Scheske said. \u201cBut we do have a very sizeable, you know, very critical of Trump.\u201dScheske describes himself as libertarian and Trump as a populist. \u201cSo, he is kind of hit or miss with me,\u201d Scheske said.There are Harris yard signs and posters and placards all around Ann Arbor. Signs of Trump support are much harder to find. On campus, Scheske said Trump\u2019s unequivocal support for Israel makes it harder to win over Democrats critical of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s defense of the Jewish state.\u201cIf it was up to me, he would not have been the Republican nominee,\u201d Scheske said.\u2018We feel a sense of betrayal\u2019The biggest risk for Harris is that young voters stay home, skip the presidential line on the ballot, or vote third party.In May, Wayne State student Summer Matkin was leaning third party. Biden was the Democratic nominee then, and she had concerns both about his age and the Israel-Hamas conflict.Now, she calls Harris \u201cthe safest option\u201d even though she is frustrated the bloodshed in the Middle East continues.There were signs of trouble for Harris, though, when we stopped by a meeting of the Wayne State Syrian Students Association.The roughly 20 students in the room did not want to be quoted by name or have their faces captured on camera. But when asked if they would have a hard time voting for Harris, nearly every hand in the room went up.Wayne State student Wahbeh Nuseibeh talks with John King in Dearborn, Michigan.CNNLikewise, Wahbeh Nuseibeh, a 26-year-old Wayne State student, said he would not vote for Harris in 2024 after voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020.\u201cWe feel a sense of betrayal,\u201d said Nuseibeh, who is Palestinian.\u201cI\u2019m not voting for Kamala Harris. I cannot in good conscience,\u201d he said. In his view, his tax dollars pay for bombs shipped to Israel \u201cto kill my friends and family overseas.\u201dNuseibeh will likely choose a third-party option.\u201cDonald Trump is a threat to our democracy and a threat to our society,\u201d he said in an interview at a Yemeni coffee shop in majority Arab American Dearborn just outside Detroit.Maya Siegmann will cast her vote for Harris, though she found the vice president\u2019s debate answers far too vague.\u201cShe didn\u2019t directly answer most of the questions and seemed to go around them or could not give a real answer,\u201d Siegmann said. \u201cAnd when the topic of the Israel-Hamas war came up, there wasn\u2019t really a solid response as to how she would solve it.\u201dSiegmann is active in the Hillel campus Jewish organization at Wayne State and just got back from a summer in Israel. There, she said, she was asked a lot about public opinion in the United States.\u201cThe response was basically that the propaganda war, the social media war, the news war that Hamas and Israel are fighting, Hamas is winning right now,\u201d Siegmann said.Wayne State student Maya Siegmann talks with John King on campus in Detroit, Michigan.CNNLast year was tense on campus and as both the October 7 anniversary of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel and then the US election draw near, Siegmann said she is mindful that emotions could get high again. She is a proud Jew and fervent supporter of Israel, but she is also critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his conduct of the war.But she says such nuance can get quickly lost when passions get high.\u201cI worry that when it does come up, because we have different classes, like policy classes, that it will be an argument and less a discussion.\u201dThe campus has a large Arab and Muslim population, and Siegmann said this semester she is making more of an effort to get to know classmates better.\u201cThese are people I am going to be with until I complete my degree or degrees,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I want to kind of form that solid groundwork so that I can build off that.\u201d", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Economic worries boost Trump\u2019s Hispanic support in battleground Nevada", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/nevada-hispanic-voters-trump-harris/index.html", "content": "Henderson, NevadaCNN\u2014The sounds of blasting and bulldozing in the hills overlooking Las Vegas are proof change is a constant here, with the new $5 million homes evidence of the vibrant, upscale demand.It is progress, longtime Las Vegas real estate agent Zoila Sanchez says, as she points out new construction from the patio of her own home in suburban Henderson.

The state had the highest pandemic unemployment rate, at one point just shy of 31% \u2013 more than twice the national average. The statistics now are clear: the jobs are back, and then some.

In that meeting, he bet neither Trump nor Biden would be on the ballot in the end.

He says his wife is excited, and that he shares her view that there is inspiration in the vice president\u2019s story.\u201cShe came up with immigrant parents, which to me, it\u2019s amazing for someone like that to come up and be able to be president,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hit for people.\u201dHe also has no patience when Trump slams immigrants or berates the country he wants to lead.\u201cOne of the things that hurts me the most is for him to talk down America,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cAmerica is a world leader. We have always been. \u2026 We\u2019re the best. No matter who is there. The people make it the best.\u201dBut Munoz said many friends and others he encounters at community events are nostalgic for the pre-Covid economy and think that Trump is a better choice for their bottom line. Nevada also elected a Republican governor in 2022, and Munoz believes that makes it more hospitable climate for Trump this year.\u201cHe has grown,\u201d Munoz said of the former president\u2019s support among Hispanics. \u201cI have friends that were Democrats who have turned the page. They feel that the country is not going in the right direction.\u201dHarris, though, is more competitive than Biden would have been and Munoz predicts a Nevada nailbiter.\u201cIt\u2019s a 50-50 tossup,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to be out here with a direct message and talking to the voters out here.

But Republicans have dominated of late. Trump won in both 2016 and 2020. Both\u00a0of the state\u2019s\u00a0US senators are Republican, as are six of Iowa\u2019s seven statewide constitutional offices.Voters who say life was better under Trump fear Democrats have shifted too far leftEbersole shared a view quite common here: that the Democratic Party is trending more liberal, more coastal, and more in favor of government mandates in climate and land policies.\u201cI\u2019m not saying that there are not things we can do to improve,\u201d Ebersole said. \u201cBut if you talk to a lot of us, we\u2019re already doing things. There\u2019s a huge regenerative movement here in the Americas by choice, not my mandate. I think that is the main thing that matters in politics \u2014 that we get to choose. We\u2019re not being mandated to choose. \u2026 We just want to live in the middle of nowhere and raise cows and feed our neighbors across the country.\u201dEbersole said Trump\u2019s trade policies were better for her business.\u201cIt was much harder to import beef,\u201d she said. \u201cNow most meat that you eat, on the American grocery store shelves, isn\u2019t American beef, and that really concerns me\ufeff.\u201d\u00a0She sees Vice President Kamala Harris as more liberal \u2014 and more likely to favor activist government \u2014 than President\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden.\u201cShe is willing to push her agendas on those of us who live a totally different life,\u201d Ebersole said,\u00a0tying Harris to California\u2019s policies.\u00a0\u201cOur California rancher friends are completely decimated by the policies and the government.

On recent visits toArizonaandPennsylvania, for example, some of our Republican voters who are not Trump fans said they would give Harris a chance to make her case.\u00a0But in\u00a0Iowa, the Republicans in our group were harshly critical of the vice president and more comfortable with coming home to the GOP despite issues they may have\u00a0with Trump and his most vocal MAGA allies.\u201cMost of the people that vote for Trump are just quiet people who want to live our own lives in our own place,\u201d Ebersole said. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to tell those people to quiet down a bit.\u201dIt may seem an odd time to visit Iowa, given its status as a solid red state,\u00a0when considering each candidate\u2019s strategy to win 270 electoral votes.

We\u2019re selling the power to help people save money.\u201dMudd also believes Trump is more tested on the world stage.\u201cI think about what\u2019s happening in the Middle East,\u201d Mudd said. \u201cWho would I want to negotiate that peace? Kamala or Donald Trump? And for me, it\u2019s simple.\u201dMudd believes the media is too soft on Harris, and he echoes Trump and his MAGA media allies in complaining the vice president rarely takes questions from reporters. He also echoes another line coming from Trump, suggesting there is no way Harris can win an honest election.\u201cThere were shenanigans,\u201d Mudd said when asked what he would think if Harris wins the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t think she has a chance to win in a fair fight. \u2026 I just don\u2019t believe it is possible. I really don\u2019t. \u2026\u00a0Many like me would think the same thing: If Kamala Harris gets 81 million votes, something really went haywire.\u201dPreviously leaning toward Biden in a 2020 rematch, but now for TrumpBetsy Sarcone considers such talk a waste of time.\u201cI don\u2019t buy the stolen election,\u201d said Sarcone, a mother of three who lives in the Des Moines suburbs. \u201cIf she wins, she wins.

JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, falsely claimed Sunday that former President Donald Trump \u201a\u00c4\u00fadidn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t go after his political opponents\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 during his presidency \u201a\u00c4\u00ec an assertion that is contradicted by a mountain of evidence.Vance, who saidFridaythat the attorney general would be the most important government official other than the president in a second Trump administration, wasaskedby ABC News host Martha Raddatz in an interview on Sunday if Trump would go after his political opponents. Vance said no, thenadded, \u201a\u00c4\u00faMartha, he was president for four years and he didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t go after his political opponents.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Facts First:Vance\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s claim is false. As president, Trump publicly and privately pressured the Justice Department, and others in his administration, to investigate or prosecute numerous political opponents.Trump madeextensive behind-the-scenes effortsto get his political opponents charged with crimes. But you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to rely on investigative reporting or the memoirs of former administration officials to know that Trump went after political opponents as president.He often went after them in public, too.As CNN reporter Marshall Cohen hasnoted, there is a long list of political opponents whom Trump publicly called for the Justice Department and others to investigate or prosecute. The list includes not only 2016 election opponentHillary Clintonand 2020 election opponentJoe Bidenbut alsoBiden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s son Hunter Biden,Democratic former Secretary of State John Kerry,Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s former national security advisor turned critic John Bolton,Democratic former President Barack Obama,unspecified Obama administration officials,the anonymous author of a New York Times op-ed by a Trump administration official critical of Trump,MSNBC host and Trump critic Joe Scarborough,former FBI director turned Trump critic James Comey,other former FBI officials,former British spy Christopher Steele(the author of a controversial dossier of allegations against Trump), and various congressional Democrats \u201a\u00c4\u00ec includingformer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,Rep. Adam Schiff of California,Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota,Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, andSen. Mark Warner of Virginia.Asked for comment for this article on Monday, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk accused the media of having a biased \u201a\u00c4\u00fadouble standard\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and said \u201a\u00c4\u00fait is indisputable that under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s DOJ, the Republican nominee for president was targeted and indicted, while under President Trump, nothing like that ever transpired against either of the Democrats he faced off with in 2016 or 2020.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9But that wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t for a lack of Trump trying.Trump repeatedly pressured the Justice Department as president to prosecute both Clinton and Biden, in addition totrying to get foreign countries to investigate Biden. That the Trump-era Justice Department declined to charge Clinton and Biden doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t mean it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s true that Trump didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t \u201a\u00c4\u00fago after\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 them or others. (In fact, Trumpliterally saidin 2017 that he wanted the department to be \u201a\u00c4\u00fagoing after\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Clinton.)John Kelly, whom Trump appointed as Secretary of Homeland Security and then White House chief of staff,told The New York Times in 2023of Trump: \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe was always telling me that we need to use the FBI and IRS to go after people \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it was constant and obsessive and is just what he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s claiming is being done to him now.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9And contrary to Vance\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s claim to Raddatz that Harris has herself tried to arrest political opponents, which Van Kirk echoed in her Monday statement to CNN, there is no public evidence that Harris pressured the Justice Department to prosecute Trump or her other opponents. The decision to bring two criminal cases against Trump \u201a\u00c4\u00ec one over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and one over his post-presidency retention of classified documents \u201a\u00c4\u00ec was made by a special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland.Trump made many public calls for investigations and prosecutions of\u00ac\u2020political opponentsOn some occasions, Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s calls for investigations, arrests or prosecutions of his political opponentssoundedmore like vague gripesthan sincere attempts to prompt official action. On numerous occasions, though, Trump applied explicit, sustained public pressure on the Justice Department in general or his attorney general to pursue his opponents.For example, in 2017 and 2018, Trump frequently harangued then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions in tweets and public remarks to investigate various allegations against Clinton.\u201a\u00c4\u00faAttorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 hewrotein one tweet. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo where is the investigation A.G.,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 hewrotein another tweet. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo many people are asking why isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t the A.G. or Special Council (sic) looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 hewrotein another tweet. Inyet anothertweet, he noted allegations about Clinton, then wrote that \u201a\u00c4\u00faat some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Trump made a directpublic requestin 2019 for Ukraine and China to launch investigations into Joe Biden and Hunter Biden \u201a\u00c4\u00ec after he was already facing criticism forprivately pressuring Ukraine to investigate them. And in 2020, Trumppublicly demandedthat then-Attorney General William Barr indict Joe Biden, Obama and unspecified others over their supposed roles in the investigation into his 2016 campaign\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s links to Russia.\u201a\u00c4\u00faUnless Bill Barr indicts these people for crimes, the greatest political crime in the history of our country, then we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to get little satisfaction unless I win and we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll just have to go \u201a\u00c4\u00ec because I won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t forget it. But these people should be indicted. This was the greatest political crime in the history of our country. And that includes Obama and it includes Biden,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trumpsaid.Trump privately pressured the Justice DepartmentTrump suggested in that Fox News interview that he might have raised the subject of Biden and Obama indictments with Barr, saying, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be honest with you, he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s got all the information he needs. They want to get more, more, more, they keep getting more. I said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2You don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t need any more. You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve got more stuff than anybody\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ever had.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Trump privately pressured the Justice Department and Trump administration officials to go after other political opponents, according to former officials and news reports. And it appears he was sometimes successful, though it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s impossible to definitively prove a direct relationship between his demands and the department\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s actions.Sessionstold special counsel Robert Muellerthat Trump pressured him in 2017 to abandon hisrecusalfrom investigations related to the 2016 election in order to prosecute Clinton, according to the Mueller report. Sessions did not do that, but heannounced in March 2018that he had (in November 2017) appointed a federal prosecutor to look into a variety of allegations against Clinton. She wasnever charged.The New York Timesreported this yearthat in April 2018, Trump told aides that if Sessions didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t prosecute Clinton and Comey, Trump would prosecute them himself \u201a\u00c4\u00ec prompting his White House counsel to write him a memo outlining the limits of the president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s powers.Boltonwrotein a 2020 book that Trump was \u201a\u00c4\u00faobsessed\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with having Kerry prosecuted for supposedlybreaking a rarely enforced old lawbyremaining in contactwith Iranian officials after leaving office to try to preserve the nuclear agreement Kerry helped to negotiate. Bolton wrote that \u201a\u00c4\u00fain meeting after meeting in the Oval (Office), Trump would ask Attorney General William Barr or anybody listening to launch a prosecution.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9The same week in 2018 that Trump tweeted that Kerry might have broken the law, the Justice Department assigned federal prosecutors to investigate Kerry,according to a bookby former federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman, who wasousted by Trump in 2020. Then, the same day Trump tweeted about Kerry in 2019, a Justice Department official called one of the prosecutors to apply more pressure over the case, Berman wrote. Kerry was never charged.In 2019, Barr satisfied Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s investigate-the-investigators demand bytaskinga federal prosecutor to help investigate the origins of the FBI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s probe related to Russia and the 2016 election. In late 2020, with about three months left in Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presidency, Barr gave that prosecutor, John Durham,the status of special counsel.And in early 2020, Barrtaskeda different federal prosecutor with taking in information from members of the public,notably including then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, related to allegations about the Bidens and Ukraine, which had been a subject of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s public and private focus.", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Fact check: What Trump keeps getting wrong about \u2018paper ballots\u2019", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/fact-check-trump-paper-ballots/index.html", "content": "WashingtonCNN\u2014After losing the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump has championed the baseless lie that the results were tainted by widespread fraud.To fix this made-up problem, Trump has proposed a four-part solution: The US should switch exclusively to paper ballots, require\u00ac\u2020proof of citizenship\u00ac\u2020to register to vote, require voters to show ID at the polls, and eliminate mail-in voting by holding the entire election in-person on just one day.Policymakers can debate the merits of forcing voters to prove their citizenship and provide ID. And mail-in voting, widely used by both Democrats and Republicans, isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t going anywhere.But Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments on \u201a\u00c4\u00fapaper ballots\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 have\u00ac\u2020puzzled voting experts\u00ac\u2020and election officials \u201a\u00c4\u00ec because almost all voters nationwide already use paper ballots.Facts First:\u00ac\u2020Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s insistence that the US switch to \u201a\u00c4\u00fapaper ballots\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 is nonsensical. More than 98% of voters live in jurisdictions that produce fully auditable paper trails, according todata from Verified Voting, which tracks election equipment in every county. \u00ac\u2020Trump brings up his four-part proposal almost every time he speaks about election integrity. He has mentioned the \u201a\u00c4\u00fapaper ballots\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 claim\u00ac\u2020dozens of times\u00ac\u2020this year alone.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to fix our elections so that our elections are going to be honorable and honest, and people leave, and they know their vote is counted,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trump said at an\u00ac\u2020August rally\u00ac\u2020in Potterville, Michigan. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are going to have free and fair elections. And ideally, we go to paper ballots, same-day voting, proof of citizenship \u201a\u00c4\u00ec very big \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and voter ID.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9In an\u00ac\u2020interview\u00ac\u2020last month, Trump said one way to \u201a\u00c4\u00fasolve this problem\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of mass fraud was to \u201a\u00c4\u00fago to paper ballots.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 At a\u00ac\u2020rally\u00ac\u2020in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, he said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe want to go to paper ballots.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 And he\u00ac\u2020said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe want paper ballots,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in Montezuma Pass, Arizona.Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group, has spent the past two decades urging counties to move away from paperless voting in favor of in-person polling sites. (Vote-by-mail obviously incorporates a paper trail.) The people who run the group say they have accomplished their goal \u201a\u00c4\u00ec despite claims from Trump and others that the US still needs paper ballots.\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s really weird and I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t understand it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Mark Lindeman, the group\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s director for policy and strategy. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAlmost everybody votes on paper ballots. Anyone who is convinced that we need paper ballots is very likely voting on paper ballots themselves.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Only about 1.4% of registered voters live in counties where there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no paper trail of their ballot if they vote in-person, according to Verified Voting\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s data. (If they vote-by-mail, then there is a paper trail.) These holdouts are the entire state of Louisiana and a few Texas counties.For everyone else, there are paper trails that can be checked during a post-election audit or recount.Nearly 70% of registered voters live in counties where voters physically mark their choices on a paper ballot.Another 25% of voters live in counties that use \u201a\u00c4\u00faballot-marking devices,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 where voters use a touchscreen or another interface to select their candidates, and then the machine fills out a paper ballot to reflect their selections.The remaining 5% of voters use electronic machines that record votes directly into the computer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s memory. But even most of these machines now create paper trails, too. The holdout counties in Texas and the entire state of Louisiana only store the votes on the computer memory.The share of voters in \u201a\u00c4\u00fapaperless\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 counties has been steadily shrinking with every election cycle over the past 20 years, according to Verified Voting.Sherry Poland, elections director in Hamilton County, Ohio, which includes Cincinnati, said her county switched to hand-marked paper ballots in 2006, and that the system creates a \u201a\u00c4\u00fabackup\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00faredundancy\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that should inspire confidence in the integrity of the process.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe trend is coming back now and everyone is realizing the value of having a paper trial,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Poland, a Republican.After the 2016 election, battleground states like Pennsylvania and\u00ac\u2020Georgia\u00ac\u2020transitioned away from paperless machines and now use systems with paper trails. And since 2020, Tennessee and many counties in New Jersey, Texas, and Mississippi made the switch too.False and nonsensical claims about election procedures have had a negative impact on voter perceptions on the integrity of US elections, especially among Republicans.A majority of Trump supporters in Michigan, Arizona, and Pennsylvania now say they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re \u201a\u00c4\u00fanot at all confident\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or only \u201a\u00c4\u00fajust a little\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 confident the results will be accurately tallied in their state, according torecent CNN polling. And one in five of Trump supporters said in a recentABC/Ipsos pollthat they aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t prepared to accept the results of the election.\u201a\u00c4\u00faTwenty years ago, Verified Voting was founded to get rid of paperless (voting machines),\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Lindeman said.\u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd now we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve just about made it.

The moderator of the Univision town hall and the president of Univision News both refuted the claim that Harris used a teleprompter at the town hall, noting Thursday that the teleprompter that was seen on the broadcast had text in Spanish, not English, and that it was material for the moderator, not Harris. And Trump uses teleprompters for most of his speeches, though he also regularly ad-libs additional remarks.The false claim that Harris used a teleprompter at the town hall generated millions of views on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. It was made by several right-wing commentators with significant followings, including\u00ac\u2020Benny Johnson,\u00ac\u2020Charlie Kirk,\u00ac\u2020Greg Price\u00ac\u2020and Fox News host Sean Hannity.Univision News president Daniel Coronell, responding to Price\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s claim that \u201a\u00c4\u00faKamala is using a teleprompter during her \u201a\u00c4\u00f2town hall\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 with Univision,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u00ac\u2020wroteon X: \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not true. The teleprompter that displays a text written in Spanish was a support element for the town hall moderator. I can tell you this with first-hand knowledge because I was in charge of the television program.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Town hall moderator Enrique Acevedo, responding to Johnson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s claim that \u201a\u00c4\u00faUnivision accidentally broadcast proof that Kamala used a teleprompter at her town hall,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u00ac\u2020wroteon X: \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe prompter displayed my introduction (in Spanish) and then it switched to a timer.

Price, Johnson and Kirk did not respond to CNN requests for comment on Friday.Trump has made teleprompter-related comments a staple of his recent criticism of Harris as he has insulted her intelligence. Last month, he\u00ac\u2020falsely claimed\u00ac\u2020that Harris used notes in a televised interview with CNN.The right-wing commentators\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 inaccurate posts claiming Harris used a teleprompter at the Univision town hall relied on a 12-second clip that was posted Thursday by the Trump campaign\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faTrump War Room\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 account.

Cindy Axne, the last Democrat standing in Iowa, went to her party\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s leadership about a month before the 2022 midterms to ask for a few hundred thousand more dollars in her race, or risk losing her seat.The money didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t come, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions, and Axne lost the Des Moines-based seat by around 2,000 votes \u201a\u00c4\u00ee one of nearly two dozen\u00ac\u2020close House races that cost Democrats their majority that year.Now, that cash crunch is a distant memory and Democrats are in striking distance of not one, but two red-tinted seats in Iowa. Vice President Kamala Harris, whoraised a stunning $1 billion in three months, has fueled a fundraising revolution this cycle that is changing the game for down-ballot Democrats and deeply troubling GOP leaders. House Democrats are so flush with cash that they are seriously competing on red-tinted turf in places like Iowa and Wisconsin that were trending away from the party just a few years ago.The Democrats\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 inroads in the Midwest are on top of the dozen-plus GOP-held seats in New York and California that were alreadythe epicenter of the battle of House control. Democrats\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 huge summertime war chests have expanded that battlefield as party leaders seek every possible path to victory. Republicans have had to buckle down on defense, keeping them from truly competing in once-feasible places like southwestern Connecticut, the Nevada suburbs and southeastern Pennsylvania.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen excitement and energy happens, then the money follows,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Christina Bohannan, the Democrat running in the neighboring Iowa district who has shattered fundraising records in her increasingly competitive rematch against GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks. Bohannan not only outraised Miller-Meeks in the last quarter, but outspent the GOP incumbent by almost a 3-to-1 margin. And Democrats are planning to spend even more there in the final weeks.The GOP is taking the threat seriously: House Speaker Mike Johnson will head to the district\u00ac\u2020this week, followed by Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Majority Whip Tom Emmer and Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders later this month, according to a person familiar with the planning.\u201a\u00c4\u00faPeople are just fired up,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Bohannan, the Democrat, told CNN. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe had a great message in 2022 but we didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have quite as much resources there to get that message out.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9But money alone won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t determine which party controls Congress. While Democrats need to net just four seats to flip the House, voters\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 focus on issues like the border and the economy means that the political climate still favors the GOP. And there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the Trump factor: Former President Donald Trump continues to do better among Hispanic voters and working class voters, fueling GOP hopes of flipping seats near the US-Mexico border and in rural Alaska and Maine.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere is no candidate in modern history, Democrat or Republican, who turns out voters more effectively than President Trump,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the House Republican Conference chairwoman, told CNN.What is certain is that whichever party wins the House battle is almost guaranteed to face another razor-thin margin \u201a\u00c4\u00ee making it all but impossible to govern for another two years.Republicans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 cash crunchIn the final three week stretch, Republicans say it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the Democrats\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 cash advantage that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s keeping them up at night.Out of the 32 most competitive House seats, all but two Republicans were outraised by Democrats in the most recent quarter, according to filingswith the Federal Election Commission made public Tuesday. (The two GOP exceptions were Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia and Rep. Michelle Steel of California.)All but six of the Democrats broke the $2 million mark, and some pulled in far more.In a competitive open seat in central Virginia, the GOP candidate Derrick Anderson brought in $1.1 million \u201a\u00c4\u00ee putting him in the upper echelon of House Republican fundraisers this year. But the Democrat in the race, Eugene Vindman, raised an astounding $6.5 million. That allowed him to outspend his GOP opponent by almost 11 to 1.Democratic Congressional candidate Eugene Vindman walks to the stage to speak during the Virginia Democrats' first day of early voting rally in Manassas, Virginia, on September 20.Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call/Getty ImagesThen there is Democrat Will Rollins, with a $3.6 million haul against long-time Republican Rep. Ken Calvert in southern California, and Democrat Amish Shah, who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenging Arizona GOP Rep. David Schweikert, who brought in $3.45 million. Both GOP incumbents are now in more danger than Republicans believe they should be.Elon Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s super PAC recently spent big for Calvert, while Trump himself stumped for Calvert in the desert town of Coachella, California, over the weekend.Rollins described his own fundraising as \u201a\u00c4\u00fahigher than we ever thought imaginable.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 And he described Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s visit as a last chance move to save Calvert. But, he predicted: \u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to end up having the resources to do it. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s why I ultimately think we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to win.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Across the country, senior\u00ac\u2020Democratic Rep. Ann Kuster of New Hampshire recently drove through Pennsylvania stumping for Democratic candidate Janelle Stelson, whose fundraising haul tripled that of her GOP opponent Rep. Scott Perry, the former House Freedom Caucus chairman.\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s insane. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s like Senate numbers,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Kuster, who is retiring this year after 12 years in a New Hampshire swing seat. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI never had a million dollar quarter. And now all of the candidates are having million-dollar quarters.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Top Republicans have been forced to respond: The GOP leadership-aligned super PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund, this week announced a\u00ac\u2020$2.6\u00ac\u2020million buy to help defend Perry in a seat that Trump won by nearly 5 points.In another \u201a\u00c4\u00fareach\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 seat, Democrats raised so much against Steel that Republicans moved money out of a highly competitive open seat in Orange County to help protect the GOP congresswoman. And the Republican group is even beginning to spend in an open Colorado seat that Trump won by 8 points.A \u201a\u00c4\u00f2tsunami\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 of Democratic dollarsOne incumbent, Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, said he could lose his race because of the \u201a\u00c4\u00fatsunami\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of money that Harris and her allies have dumped into his seat because of its unique status as a stand-alone electoral vote.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThat\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s my number one issue right now, how we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re being outspent at the top of the ticket,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Bacon said, noting that Harris is spending $21 million on messaging in his district, compared to about $100,000 from Trump.\u201a\u00c4\u00faI wish he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d put some stuff on the airwaves, show people why they need to vote for him. It helps everybody down-ballot,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Bacon said, adding: \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think the other side holds every ace right now, but we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in the fight.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Two years ago, Bacon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenger, state Sen. Tony Vargas. was outspent 3 to 1 by GOP super PAC groups. This time, Democrats have the money to keep up.\u201a\u00c4\u00faBecause we have these resources, now we have been able to battle back,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Vargas told CNN.While Trump has been focused on his own race, Johnson and his leadership team \u201a\u00c4\u00ee including campaign chief, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina \u201a\u00c4\u00ee have been making urgent pleas to fellow Republicans for last-minute cash.But it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s too late to match one key Democratic advantage: The party went up on TV early in GOP-held seats, forcing Republican outside groups to respond in those places and narrow their own offensive opportunities. As a result, GOP groups decided not to compete in once-competitive turf, such as the seats of Democratic Reps. Angie Craig in Minnesota, Nikki Budzinski in Illinois, and Hillary Scholten in Michigan.\u201a\u00c4\u00fa(The money) is definitely sounding the alarm bells,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 one senior House GOP aide told CNN. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been very hard to keep up with. If we lose seats, I think that will be a defining part of the post mortem.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9With fewer of his own members on defense, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his party jumped into some long-shot races that would have been unthinkable earlier this summer. House Majority PAC is now competing in tougher races like\u00ac\u2020those of\u00ac\u2020Perry in Pennsylvania, Ryan Zinke in Montana and Monica\u00ac\u2020De La\u00ac\u2020Cruz in Texas.Zinke himself put out an urgent fundraising call this month, warning supporters in a text: \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf\u00ac\u2020I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t do a total 180 on the fundraising front, not only will I lose my House seat, Republicans may never hold the majority in Congress again.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Zinke raised $2 million but was still narrowly outraised by his Democratic challenger, Monica Tranel. Trump won the seat by 7 points last cycle.Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s strength keeps GOP\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hopes aliveDemocrats need to flip several seats in two key states to have a shot at retaking the House:\u00ac\u2020New York\u00ac\u2020and California. These roughly dozen seats are, on paper, friendly to Democrats. Yet troubling signs have emerged.Stefanik, who is determined to protect the GOP\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hold in New York, said Trump is so far beating his poll numbers from the last two elections while Harris is underperforming those of Biden and Hillary Clinton.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a reason President Trump is coming to Madison Square Garden,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Stefanik said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faPresident Trump is a believer in Republicans winning New York,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Republicans privately believe they are likely to lose at least two incumbents in the blue states: Rep. Brandon Williams in Syracuse and John Duarte in California\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Central Valley (along with\u00ac\u2020GOP Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer in Oregon, where Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s support hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t improved.)\u00ac\u2020Many are also worried about Rep. Mike Garcia of southern California and Rep. Marc Molinaro in upstate New York.Rep. John Duarte is seen in front of the US Capitol in Washington DC, on November 8, 2023.Celal Gunes/Anadolu/Getty ImagesAnd Republicans are feeling hopeful about heavily Hispanic seats in Colorado, New Mexico and Texas, where Trump is helping them go on offense. Democrats fear Rep. Yadira Caraveo of Colorado is particularly vulnerable.Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, who represents a slice of the US-Mexico border in south Texas, said it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a warning for his party across the board \u201a\u00c4\u00ee including Harris.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Democrat Party, they cannot take Hispanic voters for granted,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Cuellar told CNN. As Democrats have been slow to respond on border issues, he warned Republicans are \u201a\u00c4\u00fachipping away\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 at their base of Hispanic voters.He added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn the minds of a lot of voters, they see the Democrats not being strong on border security and Republicans being strong on border security. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to say I told you so, but I used to say, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Guys, this is important.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s David Wright, Fredreka Schouten, Matt Holt and Alex Leeds Matthews contributed\u00ac\u2020to this report.", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Competitive New York House races become a fight to define the middle in final weeks", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/politics/house-republicans-new-york-congress/index.html", "content": "Stony Point, New YorkCNN\u2014In the fight for control of the House this fall, a trio of New York Republican lawmakers are pitching themselves as moderates willing to stand up to their own party as they aim to prove their wins in Democratic-leaning districts two years ago were not a fluke.GOP Reps. Mike Lawler, Marc Molinaro and Anthony D\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Esposito framed themselves in recent conversations with CNN as moderate and bipartisan, exposing the metrics with which the new battleground taking shape in the Empire State are measured: a race for the middle.But it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a tightrope. The three freshmen lawmakers support former PresidentDonald Trumpin districts PresidentJoe Bidenwon in 2020. Their first terms have been defined by a historically unproductive Congress. And they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve at times embraced the right-wing rhetoric of their party, particularly when it comes to immigration and border security.It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s here in New York, particularly in the suburbs of central New York, the Hudson Valley and Long Island, where the balance of power for the House of Representatives will likely be decided, and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s through these competitive races where red cracks in the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reputation as a blue fortress are becoming more exposed.D\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Esposito said of the Democrats, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThey must get paid every time they say the term \u201a\u00c4\u00f2MAGA extremist,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 because it is very clear that I am not an extremist. I have been criticized by the far-right flank of my own party for not being conservative enough.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9When asked how he talks about Trump, Lawler told CNN, \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou can sit and talk about personality, or you can focus on the substance of the issues.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9And the lawmakers argued that their relationship with conservative House Speaker Mike Johnson, who supports banning abortion nationwide, shows they have gotten their constituents a seat at the table.\u00ac\u2020Johnson is expected to campaign with the New York Republicans in the coming weeks, sources told CNN.\u201a\u00c4\u00faFrom my perspective, the speaker has given me the opportunity to leverage outcomes for the people I serve,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Molinaro said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m in the meetings every week at his office.

Instead of uniformity, streets are packed with lawn signs for both parties.The high-stakes messaging war has blanketed the airwaves, with the trio of races being among the top 20 most expensive House races in the country. Democrats, afraid of repeating their 2022 failures here, have outraised their Republican counterparts. In Molinaro\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s race alone, advertisers, campaigns and outside groups have spent over $37 million.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere is no path to the majority in the House of Representatives that does not involve flipping key seats right here in the state of New York,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Democratic former Rep. Mondaire Jones told CNN. Jones is running against Lawler for the seat he previously represented before redistricting thwarted his reelection plans last year.Mondaire Jones and Lawler speak at a North Salem seniors candidate forum.Annie Grayer/CNNThe stakes behind the direct pitchWinning his race by 1,820 votes last cycle, Lawler knows that each interaction with a voter plays an outsize role and could potentially tip the scales. He often starts his stump speech by paraphrasing a quote from former Democratic New York City Mayor Ed Koch, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you agree with me on nine out of 12 things, vote for me. If you agree with me on 12 out of 12 things, go have your head examined.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9And he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s building his campaign around voters like Brad Turner, a disillusioned Democrat who told CNN that in the Black community, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe give our votes to certain politicians and we get nothing for it.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Lawler convinced Sue Kryger, a retired nurse and registered Democrat, to support him after their conversation at the Stony Point Fall Festival, because Kryger said Lawler assured her that he would never support a national abortion ban. Kryger considers herself \u201a\u00c4\u00fapro-life\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but believes women have the right to an abortion.A few days later, though, his pitch as a moderate fell short.Patty Copeland, a retired media negotiator and registered Democrat, walked up to Lawler after he spoke at a candidate forum with Jones in northern Westchester to question his record.\u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m sick of the lying,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Copeland, who has been on the fence over who to support, told CNN after her conversation with Lawler. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI tried really hard because I know he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s very bipartisan, but he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also, as far as I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m concerned, a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Trumper.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 When it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time to vote, is he going to for us, or is he going to vote to stay on the good side of Trump?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Lawler shakes hands with independent voter Kevin Frank at the Stony Point Fall Festival in New York.

Lawler, D\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Esposito and Molinaro have signed on to a Democratic-led bill to protect IVF federally.But the Democrats argued instances in which the Republicans voted to restrict access to abortion this term disqualify them from being trustworthy on the issue.The Democratic candidates often reference their opponents\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 votes to prevent service members from using taxpayer dollars to get abortion services, potentially subject doctors who perform abortions to criminal penalties, and prohibit states from putting limitations on federal funds going tocrisis pregnancy centersas examples.Jones claimed of Lawler, \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou cannot accept his word when he says he wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t vote for a national abortion ban.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Riley and Gillen, who are again facing off against Molinaro and D\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Esposito, respectively, after losing to them in 2022, say being able to scrutinize their GOP opponents\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 voting records is their biggest edge this time around.\u201a\u00c4\u00faHe can say whatever he wants, and he does,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Riley told CNN, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut voters can now look at his voting record.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Impact of recent scandalsD\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Esposito and Lawler have dismissed recent allegations against them that raise ethical concerns, but their Democratic opponents are hoping the scandals can help tip the scales in their direction.D\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Esposito told CNN that he never had a personal relationship with the woman The New York Times reported he had an affair with and put on his payroll. He had\u00ac\u2020previously\u00ac\u2020not denied the details of the initial story, but called it \u201a\u00c4\u00faa slimy, partisan \u201a\u00c4\u00f2hit piece.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9But, when asked to explain his personal relationship with the hire, D\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Esposito said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t matter. It was someone that we hired in the office to do a job. She did the job when the opportunity to work there was no longer \u201a\u00c4\u00ee that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s it.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9D\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Esposito addresses supporters at a campaign event in Franklin Square, New York.Annie Grayer/CNNGillen, whom D\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Esposito defeated by fewer than 10,000 votes two years ago, claimed the allegations expose deeper issues of favoritism.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is a disturbing continued pattern of behavior for Anthony D\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Esposito,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she told CNN.Meanwhile, roughly an hour north, Lawler is working to maintain inroads with moderates after acknowledging that he darkened his face aspart of a Michael Jackson Halloween costume, which he has called an \u201a\u00c4\u00fahomage.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve addressed it head-on,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Lawler, who has apologized for his actions 18 years ago and said he would not do today, told CNN.Jones said the photograph makes Lawler \u201a\u00c4\u00faunfit to serve.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faHow can anyone who doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t believe that what he did in 2006 was wrong continue to represent a diverse community like this?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Jones added.Voters from Lawler\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s district have had a range of reactions.Teyana Cowan, a registered Democrat who identifies as Indigenous American, told CNN she is voting for Lawler and is not concerned about the 2006 photograph.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe know what blackface is.

Ten House races in California and six in New York are currently rated as competitive byInside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales.Republicans in both states are defending several seats that are held by lawmakers who won close contests in 2022 but thatJoe Bidenwould have carried two years earlier under the current lines.In New York, they include the 4th\u00ac\u2020Congressional District, held by freshman Rep.Anthony D\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Esposito, and a pair of upstate seats also represented by first-term lawmakers, Marc Molinaro (19th\u00ac\u2020District) and Mike Lawler (17th\u00ac\u2020District).The GOP is also trying to hold on to several competitive seats in California, mostly in territory that backed Biden in 2020. The vulnerable members include a pair of Central Valley congressmen \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Reps. David Valadao of the 22nd\u00ac\u2020District and John Duarte of the 13th\u00ac\u2020District. Also on the list are Reps. Mike Garcia of the 27th\u00ac\u2020District and Michelle Steel of the 45th\u00ac\u2020District, both in the Los Angeles area, and Rep. Kevin Calvert, whose 41st\u00ac\u2020District in the Inland Empire would have narrowly supportedDonald Trumpfour years ago.Top contestsWith those series of highly competitive contests beckoning, both California and New York have been flooded with ad money from outside groups, while grassroots donors, responding to battleground appeals, have helped the candidates push ad spending totals even higher. California, in particular, saw twice as much House ad spending in the month since the last primaries as any other state.And in the top 20 House contests for ad spending between September 11 and October 10, Democrats combined to outspend Republicans in 17 of them by a net of more than $30 million in total.The three races where Republicans led in ad spending wereNebraska\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2nd\u00ac\u2020District, California\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 22nd\u00ac\u2020and Iowa\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 3rd \u201a\u00c4\u00ec all three seats that the party is defending.In a few races \u201a\u00c4\u00ec such as D\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Esposito\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s seat in New York; Duarte\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s seat in California; Pennsylvania\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 7th\u00ac\u2020District held by three-term Democratic Rep.

Congressional Leadership Fund, the top House GOP super PAC, spent nearly $60 million, 16% of the total in the month, while its Democratic counterpart, House Majority PAC, spent about $35.5 million, which was 9% of the ad spending total on House races over the 30-day period.Top advertisers and issuesCollectively, Congressional Leadership Fund and House Majority PAC accounted for more than a quarter of all the ad spending in the first full month since the last primaries, and the content of their TV ads reflects the messaging priorities for both parties.According to AdImpact data, Congressional Leadership Fund spent about $42 million on broadcast TV ads in those 30 days, and 39%\u00ac\u2020went to ads that referenced\u00ac\u2020immigration, the top ranked issue in its advertising; CLF also spent more than a quarter of its total ad budget on spots that referenced\u00ac\u2020crime, and also\u00ac\u2020taxes.On the other side, House Majority PAC spent more than $25\u00ac\u2020million on broadcast TV ads over the same period, and abortion rights dominated its TV ads more than any other issues by a wide margin \u201a\u00c4\u00ec about 71%\u00ac\u2020of the super PAC\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s broadcast TV spend went to ads referencing\u00ac\u2020abortion. HMP also spent nearly 40% of its TV ad budget on spots referencing crime, in many cases warning against the\u00ac\u2020criminalization\u00ac\u2020of abortion, while ads about\u00ac\u2020character\u00ac\u2020accounted for about 17% of its spending.In addition, Fairshake, a super PAC funded by cryptocurrency interests, has seized an influential role in the campaign, spending nearly $15 million since the final primaries on ads backing a bipartisan slate of industry-friendly candidates in 17 races. The spots praise the candidates\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u00ac\u2020economic policies\u00ac\u2020and legislative records on\u00ac\u2020other key issues.Looking aheadCampaigns and outside groups routinely book advertising time far in advance, and those future ad reservations are subject to change as candidates and their allies adjust their bookings and spend more campaign money.With three weeks to go before votes are counted in the 2024 election, though, House races in California and New York were poised to continue dominating the landscape, while Democrats held an overall edge in remaining future ad reservations.Including bookings between\u00ac\u2020October 11 and Election Day, all advertisers in House races have combined ad reservations totaling more than $441 million, and Democrats lead Republicans by about $252 million to $183 million.California alone was set to see more than $89\u00ac\u2020million worth of advertising for House races over the final three and half weeks, while New York was set for more than $50 million\u00ac\u2020\u201a\u00c4\u00ec together, about a third\u00ac\u2020of all the ad spending targeting the battle for the House in the crucial final stretch.", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Nebraska\u2019s high court says people with felony records can register to vote", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/politics/nebraska-felons-voting/index.html", "content": "Omaha, NebraskaAP\u2014Nebraska\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s top election official had no authority to declare unconstitutional a state law that\u00ac\u2020restored the voting rights\u00ac\u2020of those who have been convicted of a felony, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in a decision with implications for the approaching election.In July, Secretary of State Bob Evnen ordered county election officials to\u00ac\u2020reject the voter registrations\u00ac\u2020of those with felony convictions, citing an opinion issued by Attorney General Mike Hilgers. That opinion, which Evnen had requested, deemed as unconstitutional a law passed this year by the Legislature immediately restoring the voting rights of people who have completed the terms of their felony sentences.Evnen\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s order could have kept 7,000 or more Nebraska residents from voting in the upcoming election, the American Civil Liberties Union said. Many of them reside in Nebraska\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Omaha-centered 2nd Congressional District, where both the\u00ac\u2020race for president\u00ac\u2020and Congress could be in play.In an otherwise reliably Republican state that, unlike most others, splits its electoral votes, the district has twice awarded an electoral vote to Democratic presidential candidates \u201a\u00c4\u00ee once to Barack Obama in 2008 and again to\u00ac\u2020Joe Biden in 2020. In a presidential race shown by polling to be a dead heat, a single electoral vote could determine who wins.Given the Omaha district\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s history, Democratic presidential nominee\u00ac\u2020Kamala Harris\u00ac\u2020and Democratic groups have spent millions in the district in the hopes of securing the electoral vote \u201a\u00c4\u00ee far more than former President Donald Trump and Republican groups.The last day to register to vote for the 2024 general election in Nebraska is October 25 and must be done in person at a voter\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s county election commission office. Election Day is November 5.Hilgers\u201a\u00c4\u2264 opinion had said the new law violates the state constitution\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s separation of powers, saying only the state Board of Pardons under the control of the executive branch can restore voting rights through pardons.Pardons are exceedingly rare in Nebraska. Evnen, Hilgers and Gov. Jim Pillen make up the three-member Board of Pardons. All three are Republicans.The opinion also found unconstitutional a 2005 state law that restored the voting rights of people with felony convictions two years after they complete the terms of their sentences.The ACLU is representing advocacy group Civic Nebraska and two Nebraska residents, a Republican and an independent, who would be denied the right to vote under Evnen\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s directive. Because Evnen\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s move came only weeks ahead of the November election, the ACLU asked to take the lawsuit directly to the Nebraska Supreme Court, and the high court agreed.Restoring the\u00ac\u2020voting rights of former felons\u00ac\u2020has drawn national attention in recent years. In Florida, lawmakers weakened a 2018 voter-approved constitutional amendment to restore the voting rights of most convicted felons. Following that, an\u00ac\u2020election police unit\u00ac\u2020championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis arrested 20 former felons. Several of them said they were\u00ac\u2020confused by the arrests\u00ac\u2020because they had been allowed to register to vote.In Tennessee, lawmakers\u00ac\u2020killed a bipartisan bill\u00ac\u2020this year that would have let residents convicted of felonies apply to vote again without also restoring their gun rights.Dozens of states allow people living with felony convictions to vote, either for those not currently in prison or upon completion of their sentences. Two states, Maine and Vermont, allow everyone, even those in prison, to vote. But despite a recent trend toward restoration of rights, felony disenfranchisement laws prevent around 5.85 million people across the country from voting, according to the ACLU.Felony disenfranchisement laws date to the Jim Crow era and mainly targeted Black people, according to experts. Black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive\u201a\u00c4\u00d8view of Harris, according to a\u00ac\u2020recent poll\u00ac\u2020from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Voting rights groups say Wisconsin students got texts that could scare them away from voting, call for investigation", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/wisconsin-voter-intimidation-text/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014A text message last week to young voters in Wisconsin is stirring new concerns in the battleground state about a messaging campaign that could intimidate college students from casting ballots this election,\u00ac\u2020according to a letter from voter protection groups\u00ac\u2020released Tuesday.The unsolicited text, sent from at least one 262- number to cell phones of people in their early 20s on University of Wisconsin campuses and elsewhere, says: \u201a\u00c4\u00faWARNING: Violating WI Statutes 12.13 & 6.18 may result in fines up to $10,000 or 3.5 years in prison.

According to the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s board of elections, there are 481,000 registered Republicans in the 25 counties, compared with 293,000 Democrats.Trump campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement that the proposals to expand voting access in North Carolina \u201a\u00c4\u00fawill ensure the people who have already suffered from the storm don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t lose their right to participate in this important election.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faSwift action from the North Carolina General Assembly and the Governor will ensure the people of their state have their voices heard on November 5th,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 they said.\u201a\u00c4\u00f2Too big to rig\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Trump has previously\u00ac\u2020released videos\u00ac\u2020and messageson his social mediapromoting early and mail-in voting as part of the Republican National Committee\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s get-out-the-vote program. Both methods of voting are promoted at Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign rallies.But that push has at times led to conflicting messaging from the former president.Last month, at a rally inIndiana, Pennsylvania, Trump disparaged early voting, and promoted it, in the same breath.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe got to get out and vote. And you can start right away. You know that, right? Now we have this stupid stuff where you can vote 45 days early. I wonder what the hell happens during that 45. \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Let\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s move, see these votes? We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve got about a million votes in there. Let\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s move them. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re fixing the air conditioner in the room, right?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 No, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s terrible,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trump said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat happened the last time was disgraceful, including right here. But we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to let it happen again. You know, too big to rig, right? That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s one way you do it.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9In 2020, Trump called mail-in ballots \u201a\u00c4\u00fadangerous\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00facorrupt.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u00ac\u2020Hesaid they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4dlead to \u201a\u00c4\u00famassive electoral fraud\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and a \u201a\u00c4\u00farigged\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 2020 election.Now locked in a tight election against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign is actively\u00ac\u2020promoting early in-person and mail voting, even as the former president pledged to one day eliminate the commonly used practices.

No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and noncitizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9the RNC call from April said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t even an American citizen.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Pushing North Carolina to expand accessOn Tuesday, the Trump campaign issued astatement proposing 10 policy changesfor North Carolina to help voters in areas hit by Hurricane Helene, some of which were enacted by the state legislature.The Republican-led legislature\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bill, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper on Thursday, gave the 25 counties in the federally declared disaster area additional flexibility to run their elections. The law contains provisions similar to several of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposals, including giving counties more flexibility on early voting hours and allowing counties to use temporary voting locations if precincts are unusable.Destroyed homes are seen in Chimney Rock, North Carolina, on October 2, 2024, after the passage of Hurricane Helene.Allison Joyce/AFP/Getty Images\u201a\u00c4\u00faI will give the Republicans who are in charge here credit for passing good legislation (Wednesday) that definitely will address needs of voters,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Bob Phillips, the executive director of Common Cause North Carolina, a group that advocates for expanded voter access. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe biggest thing is giving each of these county board of elections the flexibility with regards to voting sites, both for early voting and Election Day.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9The Trump campaign also proposed expanding bipartisan teams to help voters request and deliver absentee ballots to county boards and allowing voters displaced to other counties in the state to cast provisional ballots that would be delivered back to their home county.In Georgia, however,where Helene also caused significant damage,\u00ac\u2020Republicans\u00ac\u2020opposed an attempt to\u00ac\u2020expand voter access. The Republican National Committee intervened as a defendant in a lawsuit brought by civil rights groups to extend the county\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s voter registration deadline, which was Monday.A federal judge on Thursdaydenied that motion, saying it \u201a\u00c4\u00falacked clarity and detail\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 as to how specific individuals were harmed.A similar lawsuit over the voter registration deadline in Florida \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which is still determining the damage inflicted byHurricane Milton\u201a\u00c4\u00ec was also dismissed by a federal judge on Wednesday.An RNC spokesperson said liberal groups in Georgia were trying to use the courts to extend registration deadlines enacted by the legislature, when voters have had months to register to vote in Georgia.\u201a\u00c4\u00faAs many Americans are still reeling from the impact of Hurricane Helene, the Trump Campaign and RNC are fighting to expand voting access for those displaced, and we are meeting voters where they are to ensure they are educated on voting changes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said RNC spokesperson Anna Kelly.Trump and his allies have argued there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a difference in changes approved by a legislature \u201a\u00c4\u00ec like the campaign asked North Carolina to do \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and many of the changes that were made in 2020 by election boards during the pandemic.Voting rights advocates say while the circumstances are different between a pandemic and a hurricane, the idea of allowing displaced voters to participate in an election should be the same.\u201a\u00c4\u00faEven to the extent these disasters cause different hurdles, the policy solutions are often the same,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center. \u201a\u00c4\u00faExpanded access is key, and in order to expand access, funding is key. The things we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re advocating for right now in North Carolina and Florida, in many ways, echo the things we were advocating for in 2020.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Biden\u2019s clean energy law revived this red corner of Georgia.

That the effort has crossed party lines is rare enough in these polarized times.But that it happened in a community that backs a presidential candidate who has attacked the very law that is central to its rapid expansion underscores the complex \u2013 and in this case, contradictory - overlap of politics and a local economy.The Qcells solar panel plant in Dalton, GeorgiaCNNTrump strikes a chordLocated in the congressional district represented by GOP firebrandMarjorie Taylor Greene, Dalton is Trump country.\u201cThe independence that we keep up here \u2013 it\u2019s that independence and outsider that he\u2019s really struck a chord with,\u201d Carpenter said of Trump\u2019s rock-solid support in the area. \u201cAnd my folks, they appreciate that.

Kasey CarpenterCNNThis is the paradox playing out during a dramatic comeback for this part of the state.The Qcells plant \u2013 the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere \u2013 sits in what has long been known as the carpet capital of the world.The moniker can be found on the signs welcoming visitors to Dalton, which has held a dominant market share of the carpet and flooring industry for decades.But it also left the area particular vulnerable to something most thought was impossible until 2008: a housing market crash.\u201cIt was a bloodbath for us here,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cIt was a ghost town. And it took us years to get out of it.\u201dThe market collapse sparked local leaders to start thinking through \u2013 and setting up the infrastructure for \u2013 the diversification of the town\u2019s economy.That overlapped with efforts at the state level \u2013 most recently by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp \u2013 to line up incentives for major companies to relocate to or build in Georgia.The Biden administration\u2019s incentives from the federal side turbocharged the efforts on green energy.\u201cThey are all equally important,\u201d Nash said when asked whose support was most critical between federal, state and local government. \u201cIt\u2019s like a recipe and without one ingredient, you can\u2019t successfully have this project.\u201dThe result has been the revival of a model that was thought to be a thing of the past.\u201cIf you walk around in the factory, you\u2019re going see a broad age band,\u201d Nash said. \u201cWe have a 65-year-old father. His son and his daughter work here. There are high school students that we interview because of their gaming.\u201dWhat was once aspirational is now reality \u2013 and growing.\u2018A hometown feel\u2019Just about 50 miles down I-75 is Cartersville, where on a recent Saturday the center of town was jam-packed with residents stopping through booths filled by local vendors selling locally sourced food and agricultural goods.For two years running, this has been ranked the top farmer\u2019s market in Georgia, which might not be expected in a county that voted 75% for Trump in 2020.Cartersville, Georgia, Mayor Matt Santini talks with CNN's Phil Mattingly at the town's farmer's market.CNNBut in some ways, it\u2019s a key element to an approach that helped the town lure Qcells to build its next plant here, just a few miles away from where CNN linked up with its mayor, Matt Santini.This is clearly a Republican town, with deep-rooted support for the former president. But in Santini\u2019s mind, the true nature of the place is the community itself.\u201cIt\u2019s doubled in size since I moved here in the early \u201890s, but it\u2019s still a place where, again, you can walk through a farmer\u2019s market,\u201d Santini said. \u201cYou see people talking and getting along with each other. We have a hometown feel.\u201dCNNvideoRelated videoPoll shows Trump has edge with voters on this key issueBack in Dalton, that hometown feel is exactly the vibe a visitor gets walking into the Oakwood Cafe.The restaurant is technically the day job for Carpenter, the state legislator \u2013 and one that keeps him connected to the community he represents while in Atlanta when the Legislature is in session.\u201cI\u2019m real connected,\u201d Carpenter said with a chuckle. \u201cI fry their chicken on Monday, and Saturdays I\u2019m washing their dishes.\u201dCarpenter describes his community and its residents with pride.\u201cIt\u2019s blue-collar, man.

And it\u2019s real,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cIt will have consequences.\u201dQcells representatives are quick to point out that they first broke ground in Dalton in 2018 because Trump\u2019s tariffs on solar panels incentivized production stateside.Still, the former president\u2019s threats are impossible to ignore, even if the bipartisan support for the project across the federal, state and local levels offers it a level of protection should Trump win.\u201cYou want to ask me that after November?\u201d Nash, the Qcells plant manager, responded when asked about the future for the industry.Lisa Nash, the Qcells plant manager, speaks with Mattingly.CNNBut she underscored the scale of the transformation already underway \u2013 and what that means for the future.\u201cNo, I\u2019m optimistic because we\u2019re just scratching the surface,\u201d she said.It\u2019s a future Nash\u2019s parents thought didn\u2019t exist.\u201cBoth of them said, \u2018Don\u2019t go into manufacturing,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI\u2019d like to think they\u2019re both proud of me today because of this. I look at my kids and my grandkids, and I\u2019m thinking: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t mind them doing that.\u2019\u201dIt\u2019s a window into a transformation that has taken hold of an entire community \u2013 a one-industry town no more.Asked if there were any plans to add \u201cSolar capital of the world\u201d onto the current Dalton signs in town, Carpenter thought about it for a minute.\u201cNo, but we should, though,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta wait and see what happens.

With that comes a significant dose of hope that those places can regain some form of the economic success that defined their past.\u201cMany of the matriarchs and patriarchs of our families who are now retired, they\u2019re holding on to their properties. They\u2019re hoping that they have something that they can pass down to the generations, to the next generation,\u201d Coleman says.But their personal journeys are as distinct as the communities within which they were raised.They diverge on their choice of presidential candidate this November. Their explanations as to why \u2013 and their observations of where others in their communities stand on things just weeks before Election Day \u2013 offer a candid glance at the opportunities and potential pitfalls facing Trump and Vice PresidentKamala Harris.Hurley Coleman IIICNNA story of resilienceThe Coleman family embodies Saginaw\u2019s economic journey since they arrived in Central Michigan, like so many other Black families, during the manufacturing boom that spurred the Great Migration. The automotive industry was the dominant employer \u2013 and between General Motors and the rings of suppliers and support businesses that surrounded the plant here, the community was deeply attached to the company\u2019s operations.\u201cEighty to ninety percent of the adults in the church were employed full time with GM,\u201d Coleman\u2019s father, a bishop in the Church of God in Christ, says of the congregation he inherited from his own dad.\u201cRight now, in our congregation, I have one person full-time employed by the auto industry,\u201d Hurley Coleman Jr. says.In recent years, other industries have started to move in to provide opportunities that had seemed all too fleeting as the broad-based manufacturing tied to major automakers atrophied in the area.Advanced manufacturing across several industries, including major investments in electric vehicle supply chains, have developed, and major hospitals and medical device companies have expanded their foothold.\u201cThe story that I\u2019d like for us to tell is that we\u2019re resilient and that we do bounce back and that we do have people in this region that are thinking towards the future and that we have, hopefully, a new generation of people that will love this region as well, just like we do,\u201d the younger Coleman says.Coleman was sitting at his kitchen table as he toggled between sparks of optimism \u2013 for his community and his family \u2013 and the weight of what he\u2019s experienced over the past several years.The nonprofit that he leads works with the residents who have the least.\u201cSometimes when they come in there and we are their last hope,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cThe lights are shut off. They have no food in the cabinets. Senior citizens have been sitting at home, nobody to call, nobody to help them out.\u201dThe best days are the smiles Coleman sees when his team provides that lifeline. But the weight of being a last resort in a community grappling with violence and poverty can be overwhelming.\u201cThere are those days when we have so many people that need help. So many problems, so many issues, so many emergencies and calamities that have happened,\u201d Coleman says.Phil KernerCNNA craftsman and a diminishing tradeBack in Erie, as Phil Kerner flips through the binder on his desk filled with sketches, time cards and family history, it\u2019s apparent there isn\u2019t much he hasn\u2019t saved over the years.There\u2019s the copy of the 1920 census that lists his grandfather Edward as a toolmaker in this corner of northwestern Pennsylvania.The story of Edward\u2019s three sons \u2013 two toolmakers and a machinist \u2013 shows how deeply intertwined his family had been with the trade and their community at one time.That\u2019s no longer the case.\u201cMy grandfather did this. My father did this. My uncles did it. My brothers did it. I did it. My kids aren\u2019t doing it,\u201d Kerner says. \u201cThat tells you everything, right?\u201dKerner still loves his tool and die craft and now works for a local family-owned manufacturer of component parts when he\u2019s not in the workshop he built in his basement.His work can be painstakingly intricate, from the granular details necessary in the sketch of a design to the art and science required to build a plastic injection mold.Toys, storage containers, mechanical parts and other items found in homes across the country are likely to contain the type of thing Kerner specializes in crafting.When President George W. Bush famously stood with a bullhorn on the still-smoldering rubble of ground zero after 9/11, the firefighter standing next to him had a respirator mask around his neck. Kerner designed and built the plastic mold for the mask.But Kerner can pinpoint the exact moment he saw his industry take a turn as part of a decadelong shift to cheaper and faster production overseas.\u201cI realized that my best customer for ten years was - I wouldn\u2019t use the word undermining me - but had totally abandoned a lot of us in Erie that were doing work for them,\u201d Kerner recalled.Kerner remains deeply passionate about his profession, so much so that as he saw interest waning in what he viewed as a top-tier trade, he took matters into his own hands.He launched a YouTube channel titled, naturally, \u201cThe Tool and Die Guy.\u201d He has more than 25,000 subscribers.\u201cI\u2019m just what they\u2019re looking for - irreverent enough, you know?\u201d Kerner said with a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m the toolmaker they always wish they had working next to them.\u201dThe videos \u2013 now more than 170, including one recapping his sitdown with CNN \u2013 was the furthest thing from a vanity project in search of social media fame.Instead, it was an effort born of that passion for his trade \u2013 and his deep concern that the appreciation for the skill and craftsmanship that goes with it has diminished in the same way that manufacturing has in places like Erie across the country.The impact, he notes, cuts far deeper than a plant and its employees. The entire community takes the hit.\u201cIt\u2019s sad to see it as somebody who has experienced the zenith of manufacturing from the 50s up until the 90s,\u201d Kerner says.A street in Erie, PensylvaniaCNN\u2018Probably going to call Trump\u2019Kerner cops to being \u201ca little bit of a political junkie,\u201d and he pays close attention to the broader economic news in the country.\u201cI always tell people I\u2019m not a Republican, I\u2019m a realist. I think they\u2019re all terrible,\u201d he says.He knows the broader macroeconomic numbers point to an economy that has exceeded expectations and forecasts for several years running. But his view of the economy is tied to what he\u2019s seeing in his household.\u201cIt\u2019s not like my wages are going up,\u201d Kerner says. \u201cNot a complaint, but my wages aren\u2019t going up. And I get it - I see that touted a lot. Wages going up. Wages going up. I talk to my friends, \u2018Your wages going up?\u2019 No. I don\u2019t know whose wages are going up.\u201dHe describes his decision for who to vote for in similar terms \u2013 comparing it to a business owner forced to choose between making payroll or paying suppliers.\u201cIf you don\u2019t figure this out, you lose your home. We\u2019re going to foreclose on you. Who are you going to call?\u201d Kerner asks. \u201cProbably going to call Trump.\u201dHe estimates about 95% of the people he works with also support Trump.\u201cI think the general consensus in the business community is Trump\u2019s kind of one of us or one of them, you know, because he\u2019s at least on it,\u201d Kerner says. \u201cYou ain\u2019t like the way he did it, but that\u2019s his background.\u201dWhat he\u2019d really like to see, he makes clear repeatedly, is something that flies far beneath the current political radar. Elevated and uniform apprenticeship standards that take into account the importance of the trade \u2013 and the value that comes with it, which should ensure lifelong employment in manufacturing.It is, in many ways, the point of his YouTube videos, which have taken on a deeper meaning for him over time.\u201cAs long as there\u2019s an internet, people will know that there was a Kerner family in Erie, Pennsylvania. That the tool and die trade was great. That Phil Kerner did it and taught us how to do the best he could,\u201d he says.Hurley Coleman Jr.CNNMore hope with HarrisColeman\u2019s feelings about the November election are summed up in a single word.\u201cNervous,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m nervous about the future.\u201dFor all of the optimism he conveys about Saginaw\u2019s future, the reality of the policy contrasts between the two candidates is very real in his line of work.He sees Trump\u2019s fiscal proposals as directly targeting the federal dollars that help his nonprofit operate.The idea that tax cuts and deregulation will filter down to those on the lower end of the economic spectrum is something he says has never proved to be the case.\u201cThey have no idea the everyday, you know, traumas of a person who\u2019s living in poverty,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cPeople with money could face hardship that causes them to lose their home or forces them to struggle with the high cost of gas.\u201d\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t parallel the person who was living in poverty,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cIt\u2019s just night and day.\u201dColeman supported Biden\u2019s reelection \u2013 he and his son, HJ, even spent time with the incumbent when he traveled to Saginaw while still a candidate.He\u2019s now supporting Harris and saw the Democratic National Convention as a positive step in outlining what she brings to the table.But it\u2019s clear Democrats have work to do with a critical constituency.\u201cMany Black men in our area are still yet undecided,\u201d Coleman says. He hears often about the border and whether migrants are taking federal aid that could help people in his community.The pandemic-era stimulus checks, which Trump made a point of putting his name on, also come up regularly.\u201cThere are people who think that the stimulus checks that came out during the pandemic and things of that nature are something that\u2019s going to happen again,\u201d Coleman\u2019s father says.Still, Biden\u2019s decision to drop out of the race and Harris\u2019 rise has sparked a new level of enthusiasm, according to the elder Coleman.\u201cNow the conversation is not how bad Biden was or how good Trump was, but what possibly could happen with a Harris presidency,\u201d the bishop says. \u201cI think there\u2019s more opportunistic hope that\u2019s been created in the last few weeks.\u201dDriving down Williams Street with the younger Coleman, just before the Saginaw River, it\u2019s impossible to miss the string of abandoned silos that jut into the skyline.Once an unavoidable blot hanging over the city\u2019s business and arts districts, they were transformed a few years ago into a 70,000-square-foot canvas for contract street artists.For Coleman, the eruption of bright colors and unwieldy shapes represents more than just a beautification project.\u201cWhat was old, what was outdated is about its experience of having transformation and rebirth,\u201d he says, staring at the mural. \u201cAnd people are going to benefit off of others\u2019 creativity and desire to see change. And I think that\u2019s what those silos represent.

Without his singular operational control, the group\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s constellation of commanders, believed to be holding dozens of Israeli hostages in the Hamas tunnels, could be left to their own devices\u00ac\u2020and adopt a new approach.Yet inside the White House and aboard Air Force One, where\u00ac\u2020President Joe\u00ac\u2020Biden first learned of Sinwar\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s death, optimism abounded that a new phase had opened in the year-long conflict.\u201a\u00c4\u00faHis removal from the battlefield does present an opportunity to find a way forward that gets the hostages home, brings the war to\u00ac\u2020an end and brings us to a day after,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said aboard\u00ac\u2020the presidential aircraft,\u00ac\u2020which was ferrying the president to meetings in Berlin.Speaking to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the plane, Biden congratulated his counterpart on successfully taking out the terrorist his military had spent the last year hunting. But he also said, in no uncertain terms, that Sinwar\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s death should augur an end to the war.\u201a\u00c4\u00faI told him that we were pleased with his actions, and further that, now is the time to move on,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden told reporters in Berlin after he landed. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMove on, move toward\u00ac\u2020a ceasefire in Gaza, make sure\u00ac\u2020we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re moving\u00ac\u2020in a direction that we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to be in a position to make things better for the whole world.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9How to strike a hostage and ceasefire deal, and with whom,\u00ac\u2020was\u00ac\u2020still\u00ac\u2020a matter of uncertainty for American officials, who spent the hours after Sinwar\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s death trying to determine if he had a successor.\u00ac\u2020Biden said he was dispatching Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the region in the coming days.Blinken said in August that \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe fate of the deal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee speaking to the ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas \u201a\u00c4\u00ee was in Sinwar\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hands. But US officials stopped short of saying Thursday that his death will result in a deal overnight.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know what this means yet,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said one US official, adding there could be \u201a\u00c4\u00farapid\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 movement towards a ceasefire and hostage deal or \u201a\u00c4\u00fathere could still be a long path ahead.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u00ac\u2020would help a lot to make that realistic,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 a second senior US official said, referring to Sinwar\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s death.For all the unknowns, the moment was viewed inside the White House and across the Biden administration as a momentous one.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere is now the\u00ac\u2020opportunity for a\u00ac\u2020\u201a\u00c4\u00f2day after\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u00ac\u2020in Gaza without Hamas in power, and for a political settlement that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden said in a statement drafted aboard Air Force One and sent several hours after Sinwar\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s death was confirmed. \u201a\u00c4\u00faYahya Sinwar was an insurmountable obstacle to achieving all of those goals.\u00ac\u2020That obstacle no longer exists. But much work remains before us.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Sinwar\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s killing\u00ac\u2020is, perhaps more than anything else, the singular event many US officials\u00ac\u2020have\u00ac\u2020pointed to as the biggest potential game-changer in the Israel-Hamas war. Coming weeks ahead of the American presidential election, the death has the potential to transform a conflict that long ago became a drag on President Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s political fortunes, and by extension Vice President Kamala Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u00ac\u2020campaign.Even with Sinwar\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s death, there is virtually no expectation the wider Middle East conflict will be resolved before Election Day, particularly as Israel\u00ac\u2020prepares to retaliate\u00ac\u2020against Iran\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ballistic missile attack earlier this month. For many voters, negative views of the conflict have hardened after a year of fighting. Yet any development that could allow for a lowering of the regional temperatures would be welcome, both inside the White House and at Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u00ac\u2020campaign headquarters.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis moment gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Harris said during a campaign stop in Milwaukee.With\u00ac\u2020progress towards\u00ac\u2020a ceasefire-for-hostages deal to pause the war stubbornly stuck for months, senior administration officials had hung onto hope that Sinwar might one day be taken out \u201a\u00c4\u00ec opening doors in the talks that simply would not be available otherwise.\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt all comes down to Sinwar,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 is how one senior administration official had bluntly put it earlier this year as ceasefire talks had stalled.Netanyahu vowed to go after SinwarTo be sure, Netanyahu had put up his own series of roadblocks to a hostage deal, generating immense frustrations inside the White House. But the Israeli leader had stated publicly his intentions go after Sinwar until his death. Simply put, US officials have looked at Sinwar as the scalp that Israel needed most to be able to declare they are done with the\u00ac\u2020Hamas\u00ac\u2020war.\u201a\u00c4\u00faSinwar\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s death would provide a renewed opening for President Biden to again push for the first phase of the ceasefire deal to be implemented and it would increase pressure on Netanyahu to do so,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence analyst specializing in the region. \u201a\u00c4\u00faFor months, Israel has highlighted that Sinwar is the sticking point, that he doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want a deal, and keeps changing prisoner demands in exchange for hostages. But at the same time,\u00ac\u2020there\u00ac\u2020has\u00ac\u2020been significant chatter that much of Hamas is exhausted and would welcome a respite.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhether a deal could be struck for a cessation of hostilities will depend on the new leader, but at minimum it provides space and an opportunity that hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t existed for a few a few months now,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Panikoff said.The ongoing military conflict between Hezbollah and Israel complicates any potential opportunity for bringing the sprawling conflict to an end, one US official said. The US has been sharing intelligence with Israel regularly to try and identify Sinwar\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s whereabouts, but it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not clear any of that intelligence contributed to this specific operation.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe IDF is more surprised by this than we are,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said, noting that Israelis have told them that this was not an operation that they had been carrying out specifically to target Sinwar.Increasingly over the past several months, American assessments found Sinwar to be dug in, fatalistic about his chances of survival and determined to continue bogging down Israel in a military conflict that has damaged its international reputation.That mindset had only hardened as the Gaza war reached its one-year mark\u00ac\u2020earlier this month, leaving American officials doubtful Sinwar would ever agree to a hostage and ceasefire deal.With his death, the path forward\u00ac\u2020isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t\u00ac\u2020immediately clear.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is a big rock dropped in a lake and the ripples are quite extraordinary,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Aaron David Miller, a seasoned Middle East negotiator who worked for multiple American administrations, adding: \u201a\u00c4\u00faWill this provide the kind of political explanation and justification for Benjamin Netanyahu to seriously consider to cooperate in a way to try to deescalate and ultimately end the war in Gaza? These questions are unanswerable right now, but the ripples are quite clear.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Questions about who will replace SinwarAmong the questions American officials are now searching for answers is who will make military decisions for Hamas. Sinwar had issued orders for his commanders to kill their hostages if under siege by Israeli forces, a dictate that it wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t clear would be extended.\u201a\u00c4\u00faIf in fact you are now talking about a negotiation, if there is a Palestinian negotiator on the Hamas side who now understands that negotiations are\u00ac\u2020the only way out of this, if the organization is going to survive in some form, you may have an opening. But you have inertia and you have the need to continue to look for hostages,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Miller. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think the Israeli government position is immediately going to default into\u00ac\u2020\u201a\u00c4\u00f2Let\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s stop shooting and now let\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s start talking.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Sinwar had long lived a deeply isolated existence, often making it difficult for Qatari and Egyptian mediators to reach him as they worked to broker a ceasefire deal.US officials believed he no\u00ac\u2020longer\u00ac\u2020used electric communication devices and relied on human sources to convey and receive information. For long stretches, American officials couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t even say\u00ac\u2020definitively\u00ac\u2020whether he was alive or dead.\u201a\u00c4\u00faBy all accounts, Sinwar has been the biggest obstacle within Hamas to a ceasefire-hostage release deal in Gaza. Depending on who would take his place, Sinwar\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s death could revive hope for an agreement to end the war. Of course, that assumes Netanyahu is prepared to make a deal while his coalition openly talks about reestablishing Israeli settlements in the territory,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Andrew Miller, a former senior State Department official working on Middle East issues.Biden, in conversations with his Israeli counterpart, had tried to encourage an end to the war in Gaza that didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t preclude operations to find and kill Sinwar.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a lot of things that, in retrospect, I wish I had been able to convince the Israelis to do,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden said at a news conference in July. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut the bottom line is we have a chance now.\u00ac\u2020It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time to end this war. It doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t mean walk away from going after\u00ac\u2020Sinwar\u00ac\u2020and Hamas.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Yet while operations in Gaza slowed as Israeli turned its focus to its northern front with Hezbollah in Lebanon, its deadly onslaught of airstrikes continued, causing the civilian death toll to rise. As the US election nears, the administration has begun applying new pressure on Israel to improve humanitarian conditions inside Gaza, which have worsened significantly over the past weeks.In astern letterrevealed this week, Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Israel\u00ac\u2020that a failure to deliver more aid to the enclave could trigger a cutoff of military assistance.How the conflict unfolds in the three weeks before Election Day remains one of the biggest uncertainties for the two presidential campaigns. While not a top-tier issue for many voters, the crisis has complicated Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s efforts to win Michigan, a state with a major concentration of Arab American voters.

The lack of public details about Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s new business partner are a feature of where and how the limited liability corporation was created. And like other ventures Trump has launched while running for president, these watches are the result of an opaque arrangement prompting questions his campaign hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t answered and which couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be resolved even by knocking on the door of the business\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 listed address.CNN found dozens of other companies that claim the address as their own, too, including a separate limited liability corporation selling Trump-themed sneakers through a licensing agreement with the former president.

Carol Mendelsohn, chief marketing officer for Pierce\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s company, confirmed in an email that they are the registered agents for the Trump-related companies.

Dozens of deals over the years have resulted in products ranging from Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks to giant skyscrapers emblazoned with his surname. Many debuted well before he launched a political career and most went defunct ahead of his inauguration in 2017.However, Trump has entered into a flurry of new licensing deals after leaving the White House and while attempting a political comeback, an unparalleled use of a presidential candidate\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s name, image and likeness \u201a\u00c4\u00ee not to mention time \u201a\u00c4\u00ee while seeking the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highest office.The arrangements have netted him millions of dollars, according to financial disclosure documents his campaign submitted earlier this summer. Several of those deals trace back to Wyoming, a state that allows business owners to shield their identities behind a registered agent, a term for someone who can handle a company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s government, tax and legal correspondence.For example, Trump last year made $7.2 million through a licensing deal with NFT International, LLC, a company that is selling Trump digital NFT, or non-fungible token, \u201a\u00c4\u00fatrading cards\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and is registered in Cheyenne, Wyoming.When Trump unveiled a line of shoes earlier this year at a Philadelphia gathering of sneaker aficionados, it turned out to be another licensing deal, this one with 45footwear LLC, a corporation registered by Pierce in Wyoming as well.\u00ac\u2020Attempts to reach 45footwear through an email on its website were unsuccessful.Trump has regularly plugged these products on the same social media accounts where he shares political messaging with his followers, often with infomercial-style videos shot at Mar-a-Lago with a backdrop that he also uses for campaign announcements.That was the case last month when Trump, in a Truth Social post 40 days before the election, shared a new line of watches. The timepieces retail starting at $499, but one series \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Tourbillon \u201a\u00c4\u00ec is priced at $100,000.

The first purchases will ship in October, the company says, but promotional pictures and videos of it circulated widely online. Ois\u221a\u2260n O\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Malley, a prominent watch reviewer whose YouTube videos regularly exceed 100,000 views, called the gold-plated $800 line \u201a\u00c4\u00facheap stuff\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and said the pricier model appeared \u201a\u00c4\u00fabasic\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for its cost while asserting it \u201a\u00c4\u00falooks like it was designed on a computer.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9In his more earnest attempt to review the product on his YouTube channel, Tim Mosso, a specialist for the online luxury watch marketplace 1916 Project, found it \u201a\u00c4\u00faa littlebit ominous\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that the $100,000 model can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t go near water while wondering why the website doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t list basic information such as the product\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s size. He speculated that just a handful of the most expensive models will end up getting made.\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s definitely an acquired taste,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Mosso told his 160,000 subscribers.The Trump Watches website is, in fact, peppered with disclaimers.

Those votes could be decisive: The 2020 election was decided by 44,000 votes over four states.More than 1.2 million ballots were sent abroad in 2020 and nearly 890,000 were eventually counted, according toa report by the US Election Assistance Commission.Democrats have painted new GOP legal challenges as an attack on the franchise of service people who are putting their lives on the line for the country by serving abroad, though the civilian expat community is more centrally in the crosshairs of the Republican lawsuits. Election officials also say that last-minute changes to election procedures with ballots already sent out would not only disenfranchise voters but lay the groundwork to falsely cast doubt on the results.Lawyers for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat,accused Republicansin a court filing of seeking \u201a\u00c4\u00fato harass the Secretary and sow doubt about the integrity of the election.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9In Pennsylvania, GOP congressmenare askingthe court to set aside all ballots cast from overseas, including those from military voters, for further verification. The Republican National Committee, which is behind the lawsuits inMichiganandNorth Carolina, made similar requests for certain overseas ballots in those states to be segregated, foreshadowing the possibility for post-election fights to get those ballots tossed if the margins are tight.The Republicans will have to overcome several procedural issues that have been raised about their cases. But any court order setting overseas ballots aside to be counted later, after the disputes are resolved, risks giving Trump the appearance of a lead on Election Night that would likely be diminished once those ballots were added into the results. Key to Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s strategy in his efforts to overturn the election in 2020 was to argue that ballot-counting should stop after Election Day, before election officials had finished processing the Democratic-heavy mail-in vote.GOP officials say that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re trying to obtain clarity from courts about what they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve described as legal conflict in how those states are handling those ballots, as it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not entirely clear how many ballots would be tossed if they were to prevail in their cases.\u201a\u00c4\u00faRegardless of the number impacted\u201a\u00c4\u00b6we want every single legal vote to be counted properly, and counting illegitimate votes dilutes that and cancels it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 one RNC official told CNN.A hearing in the Michigan case is scheduled in Detroit on Thursday, while a federal judge will hear arguments on the Pennsylvania lawsuit on Friday in Harrisburg. A hearing in the North Carolina lawsuit is scheduled for next week.Less than half of overseas voters are militaryThe process for uniformed and civilian citizens abroad to cast ballots was established by the federal law known as\u00ac\u2020Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, or UOCAVA, which has enjoyed bipartisan support in the nearly four decades it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been on the books.The law is most associated with military voters, which are traditionally thought of as right-leaning, though that population is not as conservative as it once was. More significant to the political dynamics at play, however, is how the civilian overseas vote has eclipsed military voters abroad.Members of the military made up only\u00ac\u202042.3% of those registered to vote under UOCAVA during the 2020 election, according to the EAC report.Only a quarter of the ballots transmitted abroad by Michigan in 2020 went to military members, according to the report, and likewise in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, military members made up a minority of\u00ac\u2020the overseas voters receiving ballots from those states in 2020.\u201a\u00c4\u00faAs it turns out, there are more overseas civilian voters than there are military voters,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political science professor.Research he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s doneon Maine and Colorado voters has shown that the UOCAVA vote in those states has had a sizable Democratic-lean.Democrats Abroad, which is made up of thousands of Americans living, serving and studying around the world, has been phone banking, texting and emailing its database since January, according to its international chair, Martha McDevitt-Pugh, urging members to request ballots and giving them instructions on how to get them in.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are millions of voters who can affect the outcome of elections,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said McDevitt-Pugh.The Democratic effort\u00ac\u2020caught the attention of Republicans, a person familiar with the litigation told CNN, prompting lawsuits challenging the legality of a subset of those ballots.In lawsuits filed in North Carolina and Michigan, the Republican National Committee is focused on state laws that extended UOCAVA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s scope by establishing that US citizens abroad who never lived in those states can still vote if their parents or legal guardians lived there before leaving the country. (Michigan additionally extends this tie to spouses of former residents of the state).They argue those laws run afoul of provisions in the states\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 constitutions requiring residency to vote.\u201a\u00c4\u00faNorth Carolinians and Michiganders should not have their votes canceled by those who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve never lived in the state in the first place \u201a\u00c4\u00ec plain and simple. This is illegal and we will stop it. While Democrats want an election system that disregards the law, we are committed to election integrity across the country,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 GOP Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement last week.However, Democrats and state officials counter that the North Carolina and Michigan constitutions give those state legislatures flexibility to expand voter eligibility to beyond just those who have lived in those states for a certain amount of time.In Michigan, the Republicans are asking that guidance from Benson, a frequent target of GOP lawsuits, be changed to instruct local officials that they cannot accept overseas ballots by so-called \u201a\u00c4\u00fanever residents.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Her office says that there is no practical way of distinguishing ballots that come from overseas voters who have never resided in those states, and even if there was, reworking the procedures at this point would be impossible \u201a\u00c4\u00ec an argument also made by the North Carolina election officials who are being sued by the RNC.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe time to challenge the rules for voter eligibility is well before an election, not after votes have already been cast,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Patrick Gannon, a spokesperson for the North Carolina Board of the Elections told CNN, noting that the law in question was passed by state lawmakers more than 13 years ago.Pressed on the timing of the lawsuits, which were filed after election officials began sending out overseas ballots, a second RNC official claimed that much of their election integrity litigation is being decided in the weeks before Election Day.\u201a\u00c4\u00faJust because, maybe theoretically, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d be better if we can file earlier, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re still going to fight in court if we think election laws are being broken, regardless of what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s happening,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official told CNN, adding that there were election cases being decided during this period before the 2022 midterms.GOP congressmen suing their own stateIn the Pennsylvania case, the dispute is over how overseas ballots are being vetted.Republican members of the US House have sued in federal court over how Pennsylvania election officials are processing the applications from overseas citizens and are asking for a court order that would segregate those ballots for further verification.The congressional plaintiffs\u00ac\u2020all voted in favor of rejecting the 2020 election state certifications in Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s favor, despite a lack of evidence of fraud.\u00ac\u2020Democrats, who\u00ac\u2020intervened in the case, argue that the Republican lawmakers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 request could disenfranchise \u201a\u00c4\u00fatens of thousands\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of overseas voters, including those in uniform.Rep. Pat Ryan, running for reelection in upstate New York, led several of his fellow veteran Democratic colleagues in putting together a letter this week addressed to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warning that members of the military are at risk of having their votes infringed.\u201a\u00c4\u00faI didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think they could be even more disrespectful of veterans than Trump has been, yet somehow they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve gone even further in insulting and trying to disenfranchise veterans and military families,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ryan told CNN, calling the moves \u201a\u00c4\u00fastunning\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00faa disgrace.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Ryan, who voted from Iraq in 2008 nearing the end of his 15-month second combat zone deployment, called the procedures a \u201a\u00c4\u00fawell-oiled process that happens all the time and has been happening for many decades.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9He noted that each unit had a voting assistance officer and that everyone\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s identity had been verified many times long before they filled out their ballots.If election denialism is the goal, Ryan said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faputting our active duty troops in the middle of that traitorous behavior is beyond the pale.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faThese people are risking their lives for our country. They deserve to know now that their vote will be protected and counted,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said.The lawyers who brought the lawsuit on behalf of the Republicans did not respond to CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s inquiry, but in their complaint, they claim that Pennsylvania has \u201a\u00c4\u00faimplemented an illegal election structure that creates vulnerabilities and the opportunity for ineligible ballots to dilute valid ballots from military service members.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Those involved in the RNC cases in Michigan and North Carolina stressed that those legal challenges were not directed at military ballots but civilians who never lived in those states.\u201a\u00c4\u00faBy allowing overseas voters who never lived in Michigan or North Carolina to vote there, they are violating the state constitutions and jeopardizing eligible votes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Claire Zunk, the RNC\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s election integrity communications director, said in a statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur lawsuit does not in any way affect military voters\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 right to vote, which is protected by federal law under UOCAVA. We are fighting to protect the votes of military voters and overseas citizens to be counted properly, and not canceled by ineligible votes.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9McDevitt-Pugh, the Democrats Abroad chair, said that, with laws about taxation, Social Security and health care affecting her and other Americans living overseas, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabeing able to vote and having a voice is really important to us.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9She said that she feared that even the challenges being raised might drive down the number of people who returned their ballots.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThey\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re meant to open the door to challenge the election afterward, they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re meant to intimidate voters,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she told CNN.", "collect_date": "2024-10-17"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Judge pauses rule that would require Georgia counties to hand-count ballots", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/georgia-hand-count-ballots-judge-paused/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014A judge in Georgia has paused anew rule from the Georgia State Election Boardthat would have required officials to hand-count the number of ballots cast at each polling place, criticizing state election officials for approving it so close to Election Day.\u201a\u00c4\u00faNo training has been administered (let alone developed), no protocols for handling write-in ballots \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 have been issued, and no allowances have been made in any county\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s election budget for additional personnel and other expenses required to implement the Hand Count Rule,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote in his order Tuesday.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe administrative chaos that will \u201a\u00c4\u00ec not may \u201a\u00c4\u00ec ensue is entirely inconsistent with the obligations of our boards of elections (and the SEB) to ensure that our elections are fair, legal, and orderly.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9The new hand-counting rule \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which had been set to take effect October 22 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec would require counties to count by hand the number of ballots cast at a polling place, to make sure it matches the number of ballots tallied by voting machines. The hand-counters, however, wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be tallying how many votes each candidate received, as that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what the machines do.Democrats cheered the ruling Tuesday evening.\u00ac\u2020\u201a\u00c4\u00faFrom the beginning, this rule was an effort to delay election results to sow doubt in the outcome, and our democracy is stronger thanks to this decision to block it.

Passed by the Donald Trump-backed Republican majority on the state election board, the rule would require officials at a polling place to match the number of ballots tallied by voting machines with a hand-count of the number of ballots cast.The measure has drawn bipartisan criticism, in part because the board forged ahead with it so close to Election Day.Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has noted the state took several steps to speed up the reporting of results in Georgia this year. He has said the hand-count rule could delay the reporting of results, foster an atmosphere for misinformation and present chain of custody issues for ballots.The rule, McBurney wrote in his order, \u201a\u00c4\u00fais too much, too late.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis election season is fraught; memories of January 6 have not faded away, regardless of one\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s view of that date\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fame or infamy. Anything that adds uncertainty and disorder to the electoral process disserves the public,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the judge wrote, adding that while the rule appears on paper to be an extra human check on the accuracy of the election, its last-minute passage \u201a\u00c4\u00fadoes not contribute to lessening the tension or boosting the confidence of the public for this election.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Janelle King, a\u00ac\u2020Republican board member, criticized the ruling.\u201a\u00c4\u00faI am deeply disappointed for the people of Georgia,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 King said in a statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHowever, sometimes the victory lies in the public knowing that the State Election Board is paying close attention to our election process.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9McBurney is overseeing a number of high-profile cases related to Georgia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s election.

Cindy Axne, the last Democrat standing in Iowa, went to her party\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s leadership about a month before the 2022 midterms to ask for a few hundred thousand more dollars in her race, or risk losing her seat.The money didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t come, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions, and Axne lost the Des Moines-based seat by around 2,000 votes \u201a\u00c4\u00ee one of nearly two dozen\u00ac\u2020close House races that cost Democrats their majority that year.Now, that cash crunch is a distant memory and Democrats are in striking distance of not one, but two red-tinted seats in Iowa. Vice President Kamala Harris, whoraised a stunning $1 billion in three months, has fueled a fundraising revolution this cycle that is changing the game for down-ballot Democrats and deeply troubling GOP leaders. House Democrats are so flush with cash that they are seriously competing on red-tinted turf in places like Iowa and Wisconsin that were trending away from the party just a few years ago.The Democrats\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 inroads in the Midwest are on top of the dozen-plus GOP-held seats in New York and California that were alreadythe epicenter of the battle of House control. Democrats\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 huge summertime war chests have expanded that battlefield as party leaders seek every possible path to victory. Republicans have had to buckle down on defense, keeping them from truly competing in once-feasible places like southwestern Connecticut, the Nevada suburbs and southeastern Pennsylvania.\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen excitement and energy happens, then the money follows,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Christina Bohannan, the Democrat running in the neighboring Iowa district who has shattered fundraising records in her increasingly competitive rematch against GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks. Bohannan not only outraised Miller-Meeks in the last quarter, but outspent the GOP incumbent by almost a 3-to-1 margin. And Democrats are planning to spend even more there in the final weeks.The GOP is taking the threat seriously: House Speaker Mike Johnson will head to the district\u00ac\u2020this week, followed by Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Majority Whip Tom Emmer and Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders later this month, according to a person familiar with the planning.\u201a\u00c4\u00faPeople are just fired up,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Bohannan, the Democrat, told CNN. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe had a great message in 2022 but we didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have quite as much resources there to get that message out.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9But money alone won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t determine which party controls Congress. While Democrats need to net just four seats to flip the House, voters\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 focus on issues like the border and the economy means that the political climate still favors the GOP. And there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the Trump factor: Former President Donald Trump continues to do better among Hispanic voters and working class voters, fueling GOP hopes of flipping seats near the US-Mexico border and in rural Alaska and Maine.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere is no candidate in modern history, Democrat or Republican, who turns out voters more effectively than President Trump,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the House Republican Conference chairwoman, told CNN.What is certain is that whichever party wins the House battle is almost guaranteed to face another razor-thin margin \u201a\u00c4\u00ee making it all but impossible to govern for another two years.Republicans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 cash crunchIn the final three week stretch, Republicans say it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the Democrats\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 cash advantage that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s keeping them up at night.Out of the 32 most competitive House seats, all but two Republicans were outraised by Democrats in the most recent quarter, according to filingswith the Federal Election Commission made public Tuesday. (The two GOP exceptions were Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia and Rep. Michelle Steel of California.)All but six of the Democrats broke the $2 million mark, and some pulled in far more.In a competitive open seat in central Virginia, the GOP candidate Derrick Anderson brought in $1.1 million \u201a\u00c4\u00ee putting him in the upper echelon of House Republican fundraisers this year. But the Democrat in the race, Eugene Vindman, raised an astounding $6.5 million. That allowed him to outspend his GOP opponent by almost 11 to 1.Democratic Congressional candidate Eugene Vindman walks to the stage to speak during the Virginia Democrats' first day of early voting rally in Manassas, Virginia, on September 20.Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call/Getty ImagesThen there is Democrat Will Rollins, with a $3.6 million haul against long-time Republican Rep. Ken Calvert in southern California, and Democrat Amish Shah, who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenging Arizona GOP Rep. David Schweikert, who brought in $3.45 million. Both GOP incumbents are now in more danger than Republicans believe they should be.Elon Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s super PAC recently spent big for Calvert, while Trump himself stumped for Calvert in the desert town of Coachella, California, over the weekend.Rollins described his own fundraising as \u201a\u00c4\u00fahigher than we ever thought imaginable.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 And he described Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s visit as a last chance move to save Calvert. But, he predicted: \u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to end up having the resources to do it. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s why I ultimately think we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to win.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Across the country, senior\u00ac\u2020Democratic Rep. Ann Kuster of New Hampshire recently drove through Pennsylvania stumping for Democratic candidate Janelle Stelson, whose fundraising haul tripled that of her GOP opponent Rep. Scott Perry, the former House Freedom Caucus chairman.\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s insane. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s like Senate numbers,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Kuster, who is retiring this year after 12 years in a New Hampshire swing seat. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI never had a million dollar quarter. And now all of the candidates are having million-dollar quarters.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Top Republicans have been forced to respond: The GOP leadership-aligned super PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund, this week announced a\u00ac\u2020$2.6\u00ac\u2020million buy to help defend Perry in a seat that Trump won by nearly 5 points.In another \u201a\u00c4\u00fareach\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 seat, Democrats raised so much against Steel that Republicans moved money out of a highly competitive open seat in Orange County to help protect the GOP congresswoman. And the Republican group is even beginning to spend in an open Colorado seat that Trump won by 8 points.A \u201a\u00c4\u00f2tsunami\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 of Democratic dollarsOne incumbent, Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, said he could lose his race because of the \u201a\u00c4\u00fatsunami\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of money that Harris and her allies have dumped into his seat because of its unique status as a stand-alone electoral vote.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThat\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s my number one issue right now, how we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re being outspent at the top of the ticket,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Bacon said, noting that Harris is spending $21 million on messaging in his district, compared to about $100,000 from Trump.\u201a\u00c4\u00faI wish he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d put some stuff on the airwaves, show people why they need to vote for him. It helps everybody down-ballot,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Bacon said, adding: \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think the other side holds every ace right now, but we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in the fight.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Two years ago, Bacon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenger, state Sen. Tony Vargas. was outspent 3 to 1 by GOP super PAC groups. This time, Democrats have the money to keep up.\u201a\u00c4\u00faBecause we have these resources, now we have been able to battle back,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Vargas told CNN.While Trump has been focused on his own race, Johnson and his leadership team \u201a\u00c4\u00ee including campaign chief, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina \u201a\u00c4\u00ee have been making urgent pleas to fellow Republicans for last-minute cash.But it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s too late to match one key Democratic advantage: The party went up on TV early in GOP-held seats, forcing Republican outside groups to respond in those places and narrow their own offensive opportunities. As a result, GOP groups decided not to compete in once-competitive turf, such as the seats of Democratic Reps. Angie Craig in Minnesota, Nikki Budzinski in Illinois, and Hillary Scholten in Michigan.\u201a\u00c4\u00fa(The money) is definitely sounding the alarm bells,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 one senior House GOP aide told CNN. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been very hard to keep up with. If we lose seats, I think that will be a defining part of the post mortem.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9With fewer of his own members on defense, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his party jumped into some long-shot races that would have been unthinkable earlier this summer. House Majority PAC is now competing in tougher races like\u00ac\u2020those of\u00ac\u2020Perry in Pennsylvania, Ryan Zinke in Montana and Monica\u00ac\u2020De La\u00ac\u2020Cruz in Texas.Zinke himself put out an urgent fundraising call this month, warning supporters in a text: \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf\u00ac\u2020I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t do a total 180 on the fundraising front, not only will I lose my House seat, Republicans may never hold the majority in Congress again.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Zinke raised $2 million but was still narrowly outraised by his Democratic challenger, Monica Tranel. Trump won the seat by 7 points last cycle.Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s strength keeps GOP\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hopes aliveDemocrats need to flip several seats in two key states to have a shot at retaking the House:\u00ac\u2020New York\u00ac\u2020and California. These roughly dozen seats are, on paper, friendly to Democrats. Yet troubling signs have emerged.Stefanik, who is determined to protect the GOP\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hold in New York, said Trump is so far beating his poll numbers from the last two elections while Harris is underperforming those of Biden and Hillary Clinton.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a reason President Trump is coming to Madison Square Garden,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Stefanik said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faPresident Trump is a believer in Republicans winning New York,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Republicans privately believe they are likely to lose at least two incumbents in the blue states: Rep. Brandon Williams in Syracuse and John Duarte in California\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Central Valley (along with\u00ac\u2020GOP Rep.

Democrats fear Rep. Yadira Caraveo of Colorado is particularly vulnerable.Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, who represents a slice of the US-Mexico border in south Texas, said it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a warning for his party across the board \u201a\u00c4\u00ee including Harris.\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Democrat Party, they cannot take Hispanic voters for granted,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Cuellar told CNN. As Democrats have been slow to respond on border issues, he warned Republicans are \u201a\u00c4\u00fachipping away\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 at their base of Hispanic voters.He added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn the minds of a lot of voters, they see the Democrats not being strong on border security and Republicans being strong on border security.

Adelson, a staunch Trump backer and heir to a casino fortune, gave even more, plowing $95 million into another outside group backing the former president, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission covering the three months ended September 30.Altogether, just three billionaires \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Musk, Adelson and Midwestern packaging magnate Richard Uihlein \u201a\u00c4\u00ec donated roughly $220 million in a three-month period to groups backing the Republican\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s candidacy.Their staggering donations underscore the crucial role that a handful of billionaire megadonors are playing in Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s efforts to edge past his Democratic rival, Vice PresidentKamala Harris, as their race has intensified.Vice President Kamala Harris greets Democratic volunteers as she boards Air Force Two at LaGuardia Airport in New York City on October 9, 2024.Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleKamala Harris has raised $1 billion since launching presidential campaignHarris has set a blistering pace \u201a\u00c4\u00ecraising $1 billionsince she became the Democratic standard-bearer in late July \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a milestone achieved faster than any other presidential contender. And Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s filings show that a high-dollar fundraising committee that channels money to her campaign and aligned Democratic committees, took in $633 million during the third quarter \u201a\u00c4\u00ec four times the amount raised by Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s equivalent fundraising arm in that time.But Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 team has implored her supporters to send in even more \u201a\u00c4\u00ec highlighting both the billionaire backing for Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s candidacy and her campaign\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s scramble to reach the still-undecided voters in battleground states that her aides hope will break for the vice president in the final sprint to Election Day.In the battle for control of Congress, meanwhile, individual Democratic incumbents and candidates in some key Senate and House races widened their financial advantage over their Republican opponents. Deep-pocketed Republicans donors also tried to close the gap by boosting a GOP super PAC working to seize the Senate majority.Here are some key takeaways from the filings:Billionaires back a Trump return to the White HouseMusk has emerged as a significant force in Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bid to return to the White House. America PAC, the super PAC Musk funds, has unleashed a massive door-knocking operation in states such as Pennsylvania on Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s behalf \u201a\u00c4\u00ec though the strategy of a presidential campaignoutsourcing its field operationis largely untested.According to filings through the weekend, America PAC had reported spending nearly $96 million on the presidential race, including just under $57 million on canvassing and field operations.The new filing from America PAC, detailed seven separate contributions from Musk that totaled close to $75 million between the start of July and end of September \u201a\u00c4\u00ec marking the first contributions that Musk has made to the group. It received its initial funding from a network of the billionaire\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s former partners and business associates.Musk was its sole donor during the third quarter, however.Supporters watch as former President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Saginaw, Michigan, on October 3, 2024.Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleTrump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ground game relies on untraditional strategies to draw out battleground votersAmerica PAC has taken on a critical supporting role for the Trump campaign, according to itsindependent expenditure filings, which cover some spending beyond September 30. In addition to the presidential contest, the group has also spent millions targeting several highly competitive House races, including contests in California and New York, viewed as key to Republicans retaining their control of the chamber.Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s filings show other conservative billionaires also plowing extraordinary sums into the effort to reelect Trump.Adelson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s $95 million went to another leading pro-Trump super PAC, Preserve America, \u201a\u00c4\u00ec accounting for virtually all of the money it collected during the July-to-September quarter. Adelson and her late husband, Sheldon, were among the largest givers to Republican candidates and causes in the past decade, and Miriam Adelson has now given the group a total of $100 million this year.Preserve America has spent nearly all that it raised in the third quarter and has dropped nearly $92 million on independent expenditures, mostly in ads.Advertising data shows that Preserve America still has about $29 million worth of ad time booked for the month of October through Election Day, including to boost Trump in the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin.Another leading pro-Trump super PAC, Restoration PAC, also reported a huge haul from a single major donor. Uihlein gave about $49 million to the group in the third quarter. In all, Uihlein has now given nearly $59 million this year to Restoration PAC, which is currently spending millions on the air in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia.Other Trump supporters contributing big sums during the third quarter included billionaire former Marvel executive Ike Perlmutter and his wife, Laura, who donated nearly $5 million late last month to the pro-Trump super PAC Right for America.Harris has also benefited from a major outside effort funded by big-money donors.FF PAC, the lead super PAC backing the vice president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign, has bought a total of $371 million worth of ad time since the start of 2023, according to AdImpact data, including to support President Biden before he ended his reelection bid in July. It is the largest single outside advertiser in the presidential race.FF PAC will disclose its September fundraising and spending activity on Sunday. But through the end of August, according to its most recent filings, the group had reported raising more than $200 million this election cycle, including receiving $19 million from the billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and $10 million from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.More shifting rolesTrump 47, a joint fundraising committee that collects high-dollar donations that flow to the former president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign and an array of GOP committees, took in six-figure donations during the third quarter from some boldfaced names, including Steve Mnuchin, who served as Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Treasury secretary, and longtime Trump friend Dana White, the CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship. White had a prominent speaking role at the Republican National Convention over the summer.The Trump 47 committee raised $145 million during the third quarter and started October with nearly $53 million remaining in its accounts.Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s filings show Trump 47 footing the bill in recent months for some traditional campaign expenses, such as facility rentals. The committee helped underwrite at least $15.8 million \u00ac\u2020in travel and event costs \u201a\u00c4\u00ec helping free up resources in Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s principal campaign account to spend on advertising in his battle against a better-funded rival. In August alone, advertising expenses accounted for more than $3 out of every $4 spent by Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s main campaign committee.On Wednesday night, the former president is slated to preside over a fundraiser for Trump 47 at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The event\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s top givers either contributed or raised the maximum of $924,600 apiece, according to a copy of the invitation obtained by CNN.Big donors also fuel fight for CongressLeading super PACs targeting Senate races reported huge fundraising totals in the third quarter, with Democrats\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 narrow majority on the line. .Senate Majority PAC, a top Democratic super PAC aligned with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, raised over $119 million during the third quarter \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a record for the group, edging past the roughly $116 million raised by its Republican counterpart, the Senate Leadership Fund.Senate Majority PAC received $30 million from a Democratic dark money organization, Majority Forward,\u00ac\u2020along with seven-figure contributions from some of the party\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s top wealthy supporters, including Illinois Gov.

Timothy Mellon, the reclusive GOP megadonor, donated $5 million to the group, and Adelson gave an additional $4 million. The group entered October with nearly $153 million on hand.Its Democratic counterpart, House Majority PAC, files on a monthly basis and raised nearly $20 million in July and $11.5 million in August and said it raised $69 million in September,according to The New York Times.Senate Democrats make their final standWith Republicans almost certain to flip West Virginia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Senate seat, Democrats hoping to keep their majority in the chamber cannot afford to lose another seat if Harris ends up winning the presidency. Their top priority is defending two vulnerable red-state incumbents: Montana Sen.Jon Testerand Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown. Donors have responded accordingly.No Senate candidate, incumbent or challenger, raised more than Tester. The Montana dirt farmer raised $32 million in the third quarter and entered October with more than $7 million on hand. His Republican challenger, retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, raised about $10 million and had $4 million banked.Brown raised a staggering $31 million \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a sizable increase from the $13 million he raised in the second quarter \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and ended the quarter with more than $4 million in the bank.

The House GOP campaign arm, however, reported a six-figure donation from billionaireElon Musklast month as the party seeks to defend its razor-thin majority in the chamber.And with Democrats riding a wave of donor enthusiasm, the latest filings with the Federal Election Commission also showed some key outside groups ramping up their activity, while a leading pro-Trump super PAC unleashed a massive wave of independent expenditures to help Republicans close the gap.Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 surgeHarris has fully erased the financial edge that Trump momentarily gained over the summer, when the former president outraisedPresident Joe Bidenin two of the final three months before Biden withdrew from the race in late July. The vice president took in nearly $190 million directly to her campaign in August \u201a\u00c4\u00ec more than quadrupling the $44.5 million that the Trump campaign said flowed to its principal campaign account that month.The Harris campaign also dramatically outspent the Trump campaign in August, burning through about $174 million. It plowed most of that into advertising \u201a\u00c4\u00ec $135 million \u201a\u00c4\u00ec as it raced to introduce Democrats\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 newly minted nominee to voters on an abbreviated schedule.

Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 broader network announced it had raised acombined total of $361 millionin August, nearly triple the $130 million Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s operation said it brought in.Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 fundraising dominance has helped give Democrats a significant edge in advertising bookings this fall, including in key battleground states. And the vice president and her allies are overwhelming the former president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presence on social media. Democrats have spent $137 million across digital platforms since Harris effectively became the party\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s standard-bearer in late July \u201a\u00c4\u00ec more than triple Republicans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 spending, a CNN analysis of data compiled by the ad-tracking firm AdImpact shows.Party powerFriday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign reports show that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the party arm engaged in House races \u201a\u00c4\u00ec significantly outraised its GOP counterpart, the National Republican Campaign Committee, $22.3 million to $9.7 million.The DCCC also entered September with more cash on hand, $87.3 million to $70.8 million for the NRCC, funds that could be pivotal in a highly competitive battle for the House, where Republicans are defending a narrow majority.One of the notable donors seeking to help House Republicans stem the Democratic tide of cash: billionaire Elon Musk, who records show gave the House GOP campaign arm $289,100 in August, the largest federal donation disclosed by Musk so far this cycle as he steps up his Republican giving.Tesla CEO Elon Musk, top row, second from right, is seen during a joint meeting of Congress at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on July 24, 2024.Kevin Mohatt/Reuters/FileChief Technology Officer of X Elon Musk speaks onstage during the \"Exploring the New Frontiers of Innovation: Mark Read in Conversation with Elon Musk\" session in Cannes, France on June 19, 2024.Richard Bord/WireImage/Getty ImagesRelated articleHow Elon Musk has turned X into a pro-Trump machineThe tech magnate \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 richest person \u201a\u00c4\u00ec endorsed Trump in July. And in another indication of his growing political influence, a super PAC Musk helped form recently ramped up its activity in the presidential contest, spending more than $40 million since mid-August. That includes more than $22 million on canvassing efforts on Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s behalf, helping to fill in a critical role. The Trump campaign, asCNN has previously reported, has opted to outsource much of its ground game operation to outside organizations.Party committees focused on Senate races raised comparable amounts last month.The National Republican Senatorial Committee brought in $19.1 million and its Democratic counterpart, $19.2 million. Each spent more than it raised, with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spending $31.6 million and the NRSC, $26.5 million.Democrats narrowly control the chamber but face an unfavorable landscape this year as they defend several seats in states that have previously backed Trump.Outside groupsHarris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 fundraising prowess has put pressure on a network of outside groups supporting the former president to help close the money gap.MAGA Inc., a leading pro-Trump super PAC, spent more than $88 million in August alone on independent expenditures on behalf of the former president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign, funding a blitz of TV advertising, according to its monthly filing. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s more than MAGA Inc. has spent in any month this year and roughly twice as much as it spent in July.The super PAC received a total of $25 million last month from a range of wealthy supporters, including $10 million from Wisconsin roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks and $5 million from billionaire financier Paul Singer. It ended August with $59.4 million in cash on hand.On the Democratic side, FF PAC, a leading pro-Harris super PAC, reported raising nearly $37 million last month, with $3 million coming from Facebook co-founder and billionaire investor Dustin Moskovitz \u201a\u00c4\u00ec by far his largest federal donation of the election cycle.
