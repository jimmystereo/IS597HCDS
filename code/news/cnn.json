To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.CNN\u2014The race to Election Day in November is in high gear.Voters are casting ballots either by mail or in early voting. The October 1vice presidential debatebetween Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrat, and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican, was likely the last meeting between the Democratic campaign led by Vice President Kamala Harris and the Republican campaign led by former President Donald Trump.While the scene is set for what pollsters expect could be an extremely close election,there will be unexpected developments between now and Election Day on November 5.Nobody expected President Joe Biden\u2019scampaign to implodeafter theshock of his performance at CNN\u2019s debate in late June. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Harris as his replacement.Nobody expected anassassination attempt against Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience.So we don\u2019t know\u00a0specifically\u00a0what will happen between now andElection Day, or what could come after, when the country\u2019s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect:Voting is well underwayCNNRelated articleYour personalized voter handbook for the presidential electionWhile Election Day isn\u2019t until November 5, most states allow some kind of early voting, either by mail or in person, and that process kicks into overdrive in October.Most Americans, nearly 70%, voted early or by mail in 2020, according tocensus figures, although that figure was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.The campaigns will be focused on getting out the vote in the few key battleground states they think are up for grabs. In 2020, Biden won five states that Trump won in 2016. Those states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 could again be the focus in 2024 when Harris, who turns 60 in October, takes on Trump.It\u2019s important to be sure you\u2019re registered to vote as soon as possible, which can usually be done online. Twenty-three states and Washington, DC, allow Election Day voter registration.Election Day and beyondUS law requires federal elections to take place on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that\u2019s November 5.People who don\u2019t vote early will hit their local voting location. Polls will close at different times around the country. Due to the rise of voting by mail, if key states are close, like they were in 2020, we probably won\u2019t know the winner on Election Day.Regardless, expect lawsuits in certain states and the potential for recounts in others. Election Day is far from the end of the election.Separately,Trump\u2019s sentencingon 34 counts of falsifying business records is now scheduled for November 26.Also this month: Biden turns 82.December: Electoral votes are castAfter questions about the election are settled, states confirm, or ascertain, their statewide results. Electors gather in their respective state capitols to cast electoral votes for their statewide winner.Nebraska and Maine also allocate some electoral votes by congressional district, and these could be pivotal in a close race.January: Someone will solemnly swearThe new Congress takes the oath of office on January 3. It\u2019s this new Congress that, in the unlikely event ofan Electoral College tie, would settle the election. Each state would get one vote for president in the House of Representatives.In any event, lawmakers gather on January 6, as everyone should remember from 2020, to count electoral votes. Harris will preside. She could either be thefifth vice president in historyto oversee her own Electoral College victory, or the fourth in history to oversee her own Electoral College defeat.On January 20, 2025, the next president takes the oath of office.This story has been updated with additional developments."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Experience the iconic Magic Wall", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/magic-wall/", "content": ""}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/politics/senate-race-rankings-october-2024/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014With just over a month until Election Day, the same competitive races continue to dominate the Senate landscape, but there are a few significant changes to the order of CNN\u2019s ranking of the seats most likely to flip.And in the final weeks, the degree to which these 10 races \u2013 which are mostly playing out in statesDonald Trumpeither won or narrowly lost in 2020 \u2013 move in the same direction as the presidential contest will likely determine which party wins control of the Senate.Republican Senate candidate for Montana Tim Sheehy walks up to the stage during a rally for Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump at the Brick Breeden Fieldhouse at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana, on August 9, 2024.Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images/FileRelated articleHow the Senate GOP\u2019s potential majority maker is staying \u2018shielded\u2019 in push to oust Tester in MontanaRepublicans \u2013 who are virtually a lock to pick up the West Virginia seat and would need to either win the White House or pick up one more seat for the majority \u2013 have an incentive to nationalize many of their targeted races. Well-funded Democratic incumbents, for the most part, are touting statewide and local accomplishments and their support for abortion rights.Two states that are part of the Democratic \u201cblue wall\u201d \u2013 and also key White House battlegrounds \u2013 move up on this month\u2019s rankings, which are based on reporting, as well as fundraising, polling and advertising data. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are now in the middle of the pack of flippable seats, along with Michigan, which remains at No. 4.The oddity of this year\u2019s fight for the Senate is that Democrats have consistently led in the public polling of key races, but it\u2019s Republicans who are poised to gain seats and, potentially, control of the chamber.That\u2019s a reflection of the Senate map \u2013 but also increasingly some post-Labor Day tightening as GOP spending picks up and voters get to know their candidates. Still, no public general election polling that meets CNN standards has shown the Republican nominee ahead in any of the seats that Democrats are defending, save for West Virginia.And two GOP targets \u2013 Arizona and Nevada \u2013 are moving down the list because Republicans have not kept the races as competitive as elsewhere.Earlier this year, those two states were Nos. 4 and 5.

Ted CruzGetty ImagesRelated articleSenate Democrats launch first multimillion-dollar TV investments\u00a0in Texas and Florida as map grows more dauntingAt the same time, Democrats are trying to expand the map in hopes of mitigating potential losses. As CNNfirst reportedlast week, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is making multimillion-dollar TV investments in Texas and Florida. DSCC Chairman Gary Peters has insisted that this is extra spending that won\u2019t take money away from their defensive priorities. Texas remains at No. 9 on CNN\u2019s ranking, while Florida fell off the list earlier this year in favor of the race in deep-blue Maryland.Nebraska is a new state generating political buzz, but it hasn\u2019t earned a place on the ranking. Still, independent Dan Osborn\u2019s challenge to GOP Sen. Deb Fischer has prompted the National Republican Senatorial Committee to start spending here, and elections analysts have moved the race out of the solid Republican category.There remain lots of unknowns in Nebraska, but we\u2019ll be watching to see how that race \u2013 and the 10 others \u2013 develop over the next month.1. West VirginiaSen. Joe ManchinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/FileWest Virginia is essentially out of reach for Democrats, who had little chance of holding this seat without Sen. Joe Manchin running for reelection. Manchin, now an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is likely to be succeeded by Republican Jim Justice, the state\u2019s two-term governor.Justice has had his share of negative headlines, but in a state poised to back Trump by a significant margin, it\u2019s hard to see a world in which Republicans don\u2019t pick up this open seat.2. MontanaSen. Jon TesterAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileDemocrat Jon Tester, who\u2019s running for a fourth term in a state Trump has twice carried by double digits, remains the most vulnerable Senate incumbent this year. Republicans feel confident their nominee,Tim Sheehy, has an edge \u2013 and both Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales and the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter have shifted their rating of the once toss-up race toward the GOP.Democrats still see a path to victory for Tester, who has a proven history of defying the partisan lean of his state by communicating both what he\u2019s done for Montanans and painting a contrast with his opponents.Democrats are trying that playbook against Sheehy, trying to define the wealthy businessman and retired Navy SEAL, who moved to Montana in 2014, as an out-of-state carpetbagger who cannot be trusted. Recentlyunearthed audio recordingsof Sheehy using racist stereotypes to refer to Native Americans has played into that message, with Democrats arguing that he\u2019s alienating a crucial demographic in the state. In a debate earlier this week, Sheehy acknowledged his comments were \u201cinsensitive,\u201d saying, \u201cI come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color sometimes.\u201dTester\u2019s campaign is now leaning into abortion rights on the airwaves \u2013 an issue that\u2019s on the ballot in Montana this year. Arecent adfeatures a self-described \u201clife-long\u201d Republican woman arguing that Sheehy \u201cwants to take away personal freedoms.\u201dBut Republicans are invoking transgender issues in an attempt to cast Tester as a liberal who\u2019s been changed by his years in Washington, while Sheehy istrying to tie Tester to KamalaHarris\u2013 especially on immigration. Tester \u2013 who has not endorsed in the presidential race \u2013 tried to meet those attacks during their debate by pointing out that Sheehy would not have supported this year\u2019s bipartisan border bill that Republicans blocked.3. OhioSen. Sherrod BrownBonnie Cash/Getty Images/FileDemocratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing his toughest reelection in a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 points. Public polling still shows the three-term senator ahead of GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, although that is expected to tighten as more Republican voters come home to Moreno. Brown was at 47% to Moreno\u2019s 43% in a late SeptemberNew York Times/Siena College pollamong likely Ohio voters \u2013 not far outside the margin of error. But the reassuring news for Democrats: Brown was winning 10% of Trump voters.Democrats have seized on Moreno\u2019s recent comments at a town hall suggesting that some suburban women were single-issue voters when it comes to abortion and questioning why women over 50 would care about the topic. Brown pointed to the remarks as evidence that his opponent is out of step with the 57% of Ohio voters who last year approved a ballot measure protecting reproductive rights. WinSenate, a Democratic outside group, also launcheda new adwith a woman talking about the emergency abortion she underwent at 25 for an ectopic pregnancy, saying, \u201cOur lives don\u2019t belong in Bernie Moreno\u2019s hands.\u201d(Moreno\u2019s campaign said in a statement that he was \u201cclearly making a tongue-in-cheek joke about how Sherrod Brown and members of the leftwing media like to pretend that the only issue that matters to women voters is abortion,\u201d and that Moreno believes women \u201ccare just as much about the economy, rising prices, crime and our open southern border as male voters do.\u201d)The Senate contest in Ohio ranked as the most expensive congressional race on record, as of October 3, with total ad spending from both parties this cycle, including future reservations, exceeding $446 million, according to AdImpact. Brown \u2013 who announced raising $30.6 million in the third quarter \u2013 has continued totouthis work to pass the PACT Act to help veterans exposed to burn pits, while Morenotries to nationalizethe race by tying Brown to Harris and inflation and linking himself to Trump. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to GOP leadership, isattackingBrown over transgender issues to try to cast him as out-of-step with the partisanship of the state.4. MichiganSen. Debbie StabenowAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileMichigan remains the most competitive open seat on this list. Democrat Elissa Slotkin has held a narrow edge in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, but the absence of an incumbent and the competitiveness of the presidential race in the Wolverine State\u00a0makes it one that could come down to the wire.Slotkin, a third-term congresswoman, led Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers 47% to 42% among likely voters in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll, with Slotkin drawing 6% of likely voters who also said they would vote for Trump. Slotkin has a strong fundraising record \u2013 her campaign announced raising $18 million in the third quarter \u2013 but Republicans are pouring more money into this state, with the Senate Leadership Fund recently announcing a $22.5 million investment.Slotkin has been runningads on abortion\u2013 an issue that has helped propel recent Democratic victories in the state. Herspotsclaim that Rogers\u2019 past support for abortion restrictions makes him untrustworthy on the issue now. \u201cI\u2019m scared that Mike Rogers will continue to take away my rights,\u201d says one woman in a spot who says she needed an abortion to save her life.Rogers has been responding on air, speaking directly to camera while holding hands with his wife inone new spot,saying he respects Michigan voters\u2019 decision on abortion rights and \u201cwon\u2019t do anything to change it\u201d in the Senate.Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, scored the endorsement of the state Farm Bureau\u2019s PAC, which had previously backed Stabenow (the chair of the Senate Agriculture panel). Rogers, whom Democrats have attacked for living in Florida after he left Congress a decade ago, is runningspotsthat tout his Michigan roots and public service. Rogers and Republicans are alsoattacking Slotkinandthe Biden administrationover plans to support the building of electric vehicles, using the misleading term \u201cmandate.\u201d5. PennsylvaniaSen. Bob CaseyAndrew Harnik/Getty ImagesDemocratic Sen. Bob Casey\u2019s race against Republican challenger Dave McCormick moves two spots up on the list in light of heavy GOP outside spending, some tighter polling and the competitiveness of the presidential race in a\u00a0state that is part of Democrats\u2019 so-called blue wall of must-win states.September polling from Marist, Quinnipiac University, the New York Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer, Franklin & Marshall, CBS News/YouGov and Fox News all gave Casey anywhere from a 5- to 9-point lead among likely voters. Polls from CNN and The Washington Post around the same time, however, showed no clear leader.The two candidates, who met on the debate stage for the first time Thursday night, have been hitting the airwaves with competing messages, as have their allied outside groups. Democrats are going after McCormick onabortion,includingonead that features footage of him referring to himself as \u201cpro-life.\u201d The Senate Leadership Fund, which is adding $28 million to GOP sending here, and the pro-McCormickKeystone Renewal PAChave been attacking Casey over inflation andimmigration.McCormick\u2019s tenure as the CEO of FreeMarkets \u2013 a Pittsburgh-based software company \u2013 has also been featured in ads on both sides.The Democratic group WinSenateis accusing him ofoutsourcing jobsand pointing to his management of the company to argue that \u201cConnecticut Dave\u201d\u00a0 \u2013 he owns a home in the Nutmeg State \u2013 \u201cwants to buy our Senate seat.\u201d McCormick is running ads featuringformer FreeMarkets employeespraising him and touting the company\u2019s hiring policies.6. WisconsinSen. Tammy BaldwinMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesWisconsin also moves up two spots on the list amid signs that some Republicans could be drifting home toward their party\u2019s nominee, Eric Hovde, in his challenge to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.The two-term senator maintained a modest edge over Hovde in aMarquette University Law School pollreleased this week \u2013 51% to 45% among likely voters when third-party candidates are included and 53% to 46% in a head-to-head matchup. Baldwin had a similar 7-point lead in aNew York Times/Siena College surveyof the two-person race\u00a0taken around the same time.While Baldwin has repeatedly outraised Hovde, the Senate Leadership Fund is also pouring funds \u2013 $17 million \u2013 into the Badger State, and Hovde has plenty of his own money to pay for ads at the lower candidate rate if he chooses. (We\u2019ll be eying his third-quarter fundraising filing for details about how much the Sunwest Bank CEO had loaned his campaign through September.) Ads from Hovde \u2013 whose campaign recently underwent a shakeup \u2013 havesought to tie Baldwinto Harris, attacking her over border security, fentanyl andtransgender rights.But Baldwin, who\u2019s made an effort tovisit the red, rural parts of Wisconsin, has a well-defined brand. She picked up theendorsementof the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation this week \u2013 a notable get for a Democrat running statewide. Much of Democratic advertising has played up Hovde\u2019s past controversial comments and sought to cast him as a California carpetbagger \u2013 he owns property in Laguna Beach, even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin and his family\u2019s company is a prominent state brand.7. ArizonaSen. Kyrsten SinemaAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileArizona is a conservative-leaning purple state, where Republicans should ordinarily be able to pick off a Senate seat \u2013 especially an open one. But in the race to replace retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, Republican candidate Kari Lake seems to have hit a ceiling.The 2022 gubernatorial nominee is well known in the state, but not necessarily for the right reasons. She still refuses to accept her loss for governor and, despite tethering herself to Trump, is underperforming his polling numbers.Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego led Lake by 10 points among likely voters in aMarist polland 13 points in aFox News survey, both from mid-September. Lake was polling behind Trump in both surveys by 6 points and 8 points respectively.Lake and the NRSC areblaming Gallegofor inflation and immigration \u2013 pointing to his support for what they\u2019re calling the \u201cKamala Inflation Act.\u201d (Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.) And while the Senate Leadership Fund hasn\u2019t spent here, a Club for Growth-affiliated group is also airingattackson the congressman. Gallego, a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was on the airwaves for months introducing himself to voters statewide as a Marine veteran and istouting his supportfrom law enforcement andRepublican voters. He announced raising $21.7 million in the third quarter.8. NevadaSen. Jacky RosenAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileNevada moves down two spots on the list as Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen appears to be in a stronger position against Republican opponent Sam Brown in a state where Democratic prospects seem to have picked up since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.Rosen, who appeared at a Harris rally in Las Vegas earlier this week, led Brown by 10 points in aCNN pollin late August. Like Lake in Arizona, Brown \u2013 an Army veteran who first ran for office in Texas and lost the GOP primary for Nevada\u2019s other Senate seat last year \u2013 also appears to be running up against a ceiling.Rosen and Democrats are hitting Brownover his previous stances on abortion\u2013 which is on the ballot this year in Nevada. Brown, who says he supports current state law legalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks, has said he\u2019d \u201cclose the door\u201d on backing a national abortion ban.Rosen has had a fundraising edge over her opponent, and this week, national Republicans canceled their remaining independent expenditures in the state in favor of running hybrid ads with Brown, which allows them to benefit from the lower candidate rate in the ultra-pricey Las Vegas media market \u2014 a strategy they\u2019ve employed in races across the country to try to compete with well-funded Democratic candidates on the airwaves.9. TexasSen. Ted CruzTierney L. Cross/Getty Images/FileNational Democrats\u2019 decision toinvest TV resourcesin Texas was the first major signal the party is putting money where its mouth is on the competitiveness of the Lone Star State this year. Democrats see Republican Sen. Ted Cruz as unpopular and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred, as the man to beat him, even in a state that is still comfortably red at the presidential level.The first hybridadbetween Allred and the DSCC features Kate Cox, the woman who had to leave the state to seek an abortion after her fetus had been diagnosed with a deadly condition, and Amanda Zurawski, who sued the state after she was denied an abortion when experiencing complications. \u201cIf you\u2019re experiencing pregnancy complications in Texas, you\u2019re in danger,\u201d Zurawski says in the ad, \u201cand it\u2019s Ted Cruz and the anti-abortion extremists\u2019 fault.\u201dAllred has also tried to flip the script on Republicans byaccusing Cruzof \u201cdoing nothing to secure the border.\u201d Cruz, in turn, isattacking Allredover a vote related to the inclusion of transgender athletes in women\u2019s sports. \u201cBoys and girls are different,\u201d is how anotheradfrom the Republican opens. \u201cThis election is about keeping Texas Texas,\u201d Cruz has said.Cruz only beat Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke by 3 points in 2018. But Democrats hope that Allred, a former NFL player who flipped a Dallas-area House seat the same year, is a more formidable challenger and can turn out more minority voters. (Allred would be the state\u2019s first Black senator if he wins.)Even Republicans acknowledge that Allred is running a good race, and the NRSC is investing here to help Cruz and the state party. Still, Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, so this remains an uphill battle for Allred.10. MarylandSen. Ben CardinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/GettyImages/FileThe race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin remains in tenth place this month as Angela Alsobrooks fights to keep this seat in party hands. Joe Biden won Maryland by 33 points in 2020, but Republican nominee Larry Hogan \u2013 a popular former two-term governor \u2013 has a supportive super PAC committing $18 million to tout hisindependence.Alsobrooks, the Prince George\u2019s County executive, led Hogan by 11 points in a recentWashington Post/University of Maryland poll. She\u2019s become better known statewide and has made gains among voters who say they care about Democrats maintaining control of the Senate. The argument that Hogan would be another vote for Senate Republicans has been Democrats\u2019central pitchin deep-blue Maryland, especially onabortion rightsand Trump.Voters in the Post survey were split over whether Hogan would back his party\u2019s leaders in the Senate. He\u2019s winning nearly half of independents, as well as 18% of Democrats. And as he tries to combat Democratic attacks over abortion rights, he\u2019s run ads about being\u201cthe ultimate girl dad\u201dand \u201cone of the few Republicans who never caved\u201d to Trump. Hogan rejected the former president\u2019s endorsement earlier this year, but Democrats quickly seized on Trump saying that he\u2019d like to see Hogan win.Maryland\u2019s Future, the super PAC backing Hogan, is trying to localize the race byattacking Alsobrooksfor improperly taking advantage of tax breaks she did not qualify for, as firstreported by CNN. (Her senior adviser told CNN that she was unaware of the problem and that her attorneys are working with both the District of Columbia and Prince George\u2019s County to resolve the issue.)CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Georgia judge says county election officials cannot delay or decline certification of election results", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/georgia-election-certification-2024/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014County election officials in Georgia cannot delay or decline to certify election results, a state judge ruled Monday, dealing a blow to an effort by conservatives inthe critical battleground stateto gain the legal right to reject results based on a suspicion of fraud or abuse.\u201cElection superintendents in Georgia have a mandatory fixed obligation to certify election results,\u201d Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote in an 11-page ruling. \u201cConsequently, no election superintendent (or member of a board of elections and registration) may refuse to certify or abstain from certifying election results under any circumstance.\u201dIn this November 2022 photo, people wait in line for early voting for the midterm elections at Ponce De Leon Library in Atlanta.Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images/FileRelated articleWhat to know about early voting in Georgia and North CarolinaThe case is one of the closely watched disputes over election certification in the critical battleground state. A ruling is still pending in a separate case brought by state and national Democrats\u00a0against a rule from the State Election Board that requires local election officials to conduct a \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d into election results before certifying them.McBurney\u00a0said in his ruling that while local superintendents have an obligation to \u201cinvestigate concerns about miscounts,\u201d such concern \u201cis not cause to delay or decline certification.\u201dThe case was brought by Julie Adams, a Republican member of the Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections, who had asked the judge to declare that her duties in certifying election results \u201care discretionary not ministerial.\u201d\u201cIf election superintendents were, as Plaintiff urges, free to play investigator, prosecutor, jury, and judge and so \u2013 because of a unilateral determination of error or fraud \u2013 refuse to certify election results, Georgia voters would be silenced,\u201d McBurney\u00a0wrote. \u201cOur Constitution and our Election Code do not allow for that to happen.\u201dCounty election officials face a statutory deadline to certify the election results by November 12 this year.Fulton County has had legitimate problems running its elections and earlier this year the State Election Board reprimanded the county and ordered an independent election monitor because of issues that arose around the 2020 presidential election,\u202fincluding an incident where a batch of ballots were double-scanned during one of the 2020 recounts.But the extensive reviews of Georgia\u2019s 2020 election \u2013 which included two machine vote counts and one hand count\u2014did not reveal evidence of widespread fraud. Evidence has not emerged showing tally sheets were tampered with or drop box ballots were improperly taken by couriers, in 2020 or in subsequent elections.The Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Georgia, both of which had intervened in the case \u2013 with the backing of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign \u2013 to oppose Adams\u2019 arguments, celebrated the ruling Tuesday as a major legal win.\u201cElection after election, in state after state, we have protected our elections from far-right Republicans trying to disrupt them, and Democrats remain ready to stand up and make sure every voter can cast their ballot knowing it will count.

That made it the second biggest page by spending on political or social issues ads in the last 90 days, after only Harris\u2019\u00a0main\u00a0campaign page.A screenshot of The Daily Scroll, a Facebook page managed by the Harris for President campaign.From FacebookThe Harris campaign spent another $900,000 on ads from a similar news aggregator page dubbed \u201cHeadlines 2024.\u201dThe ads promoting The Daily Scroll have appeared on screens at least 700 million times, according to data from Meta\u2019s Ad Library, with about 97% of views coming from seven battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia,\u00a0and North Carolina.All the ads include a disclaimer that they are \u201cpaid for by Harris for President,\u201d and\u00a0they\u00a0do not appear to violate Meta\u2019s rules for political advertisers.The Daily ScrollandHeadlines 2024pages are just a small part of a much wider effort to reach undecided voters across all forms of media, Kevin Munoz, a Harris campaign spokesperson, told CNN. Promoting news stories is just one of many digital strategies the campaign is using, in addition to traditional online display ads and short video clips to target voters on YouTube and other platforms, he said.A screenshot shows a ProPublica story shared on The Daily Scroll's Instagram story feature.From InstagramOverall, the Harris campaign has far outspent the Trump campaign\u00a0on Meta\u2019s platforms, spending nearly $80 million on ads since this summer, compared\u00a0with\u00a0about $9.4 million from Trump\u2019s campaign and associated fundraising committees.Unlike the Harris campaign\u2019s main Facebook and Instagram accounts, the ads run by The Daily Scroll and Headlines 2024 aren\u2019t soliciting donations, and most of them aren\u2019t directing users to the campaign\u2019s website. Instead, the Harris team is using the ads to promote select news stories from major media outlets that reflect well on\u00a0the Democratic presidential nominee\u00a0and poorly on Trump.In recent months, the campaign has spent more than $2 million on The Daily Scroll to promotean ABC News storyabout slowing inflation \u2014 a major voter concern ahead of the election \u2014 which was viewed\u00a0about 120\u00a0million times by Facebook and Instagram users in battleground states, according to the Meta database.A Harris campaign advertisement on Facebook promoting an ABC News report on cooling inflation.From Facebook\u201cGood news for consumers \u2013 price increases have cooled significantly as inflation reaches the lowest point in over three years,\u201d the ads declared.Other news reports promoted by the page includean NBC News articleon Trump boasting that his crowd sizes rivaled that of Martin Luther King Jr., aCNN videoof Harris speaking the day after\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden dropped out of the presidential race, and astory from The Guardianreporting that the Project 2025 conservative policy blueprint will \u201cgut labor rights.\u201d The campaign spent more than $300,000 on ads promoting each of those reports.While the thousands of ads in the social media campaign have appeared in users\u2019 feeds hundreds of millions of times, The Daily Scroll account itself appears dormant, with only a handful of public posts and roughly 1,000 followers. Headlines 2024 is even more sparse, with only about 100 followers and no posts at all. This is because Meta allows advertisers to run ads that don\u2019t appear on the main feeds of the pages they are associated with.\u201cThe ads are clearly labeled as being paid for by the Harris campaign;\u00a0there is nothing obviously deceptive about them,\u201d said Peter Loge, director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, who previously worked in the Obama administration. \u201cThere is no\u00a0generic-sounding\u00a0PAC associated with them.\u201d"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Fact check: Vance falsely claims Trump did not \u2018go after his political opponents\u2019 as president", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/fact-check-vance-trump-political-opponents/index.html", "content": "WashingtonCNN\u2014Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, falsely claimed Sunday that former President Donald Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t go after his political opponents\u201d during his presidency \u2013 an assertion that is contradicted by a mountain of evidence.Vance, who saidFridaythat the attorney general would be the most important government official other than the president in a second Trump administration, wasaskedby ABC News host Martha Raddatz in an interview on Sunday if Trump would go after his political opponents. Vance said no, thenadded, \u201cMartha, he was president for four years and he didn\u2019t go after his political opponents.\u201dFacts First:Vance\u2019s claim is false. As president, Trump publicly and privately pressured the Justice Department, and others in his administration, to investigate or prosecute numerous political opponents.Trump madeextensive behind-the-scenes effortsto get his political opponents charged with crimes. But you don\u2019t have to rely on investigative reporting or the memoirs of former administration officials to know that Trump went after political opponents as president.He often went after them in public, too.As CNN reporter Marshall Cohen hasnoted, there is a long list of political opponents whom Trump publicly called for the Justice Department and others to investigate or prosecute. The list includes not only 2016 election opponentHillary Clintonand 2020 election opponentJoe Bidenbut alsoBiden\u2019s son Hunter Biden,Democratic former Secretary of State John Kerry,Trump\u2019s former national security advisor turned critic John Bolton,Democratic former President Barack Obama,unspecified Obama administration officials,the anonymous author of a New York Times op-ed by a Trump administration official critical of Trump,MSNBC host and Trump critic Joe Scarborough,former FBI director turned Trump critic James Comey,other former FBI officials,former British spy Christopher Steele(the author of a controversial dossier of allegations against Trump), and various congressional Democrats \u2013 includingformer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,Rep. Adam Schiff of California,Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota,Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, andSen. Mark Warner of Virginia.Asked for comment for this article on Monday, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk accused the media of having a biased \u201cdouble standard\u201d and said \u201cit is indisputable that under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ, the Republican nominee for president was targeted and indicted, while under President Trump, nothing like that ever transpired against either of the Democrats he faced off with in 2016 or 2020.\u201dBut that wasn\u2019t for a lack of Trump trying.Trump repeatedly pressured the Justice Department as president to prosecute both Clinton and Biden, in addition totrying to get foreign countries to investigate Biden. That the Trump-era Justice Department declined to charge Clinton and Biden doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true that Trump didn\u2019t \u201cgo after\u201d them or others. (In fact, Trumpliterally saidin 2017 that he wanted the department to be \u201cgoing after\u201d Clinton.)John Kelly, whom Trump appointed as Secretary of Homeland Security and then White House chief of staff,told The New York Times in 2023of Trump: \u201cHe was always telling me that we need to use the FBI and IRS to go after people \u2013 it was constant and obsessive and is just what he\u2019s claiming is being done to him now.\u201dAnd contrary to Vance\u2019s claim to Raddatz that Harris has herself tried to arrest political opponents, which Van Kirk echoed in her Monday statement to CNN, there is no public evidence that Harris pressured the Justice Department to prosecute Trump or her other opponents. The decision to bring two criminal cases against Trump \u2013 one over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and one over his post-presidency retention of classified documents \u2013 was made by a special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland.Trump made many public calls for investigations and prosecutions of\u00a0political opponentsOn some occasions, Trump\u2019s calls for investigations, arrests or prosecutions of his political opponentssoundedmore like vague gripesthan sincere attempts to prompt official action. On numerous occasions, though, Trump applied explicit, sustained public pressure on the Justice Department in general or his attorney general to pursue his opponents.For example, in 2017 and 2018, Trump frequently harangued then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions in tweets and public remarks to investigate various allegations against Clinton.\u201cAttorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes,\u201d hewrotein one tweet. \u201cSo where is the investigation A.G.,\u201d hewrotein another tweet. \u201cSo many people are asking why isn\u2019t the A.G. or Special Council (sic) looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes,\u201d hewrotein another tweet. Inyet anothertweet, he noted allegations about Clinton, then wrote that \u201cat some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper.\u201dTrump made a directpublic requestin 2019 for Ukraine and China to launch investigations into Joe Biden and Hunter Biden \u2013 after he was already facing criticism forprivately pressuring Ukraine to investigate them. And in 2020, Trumppublicly demandedthat then-Attorney General William Barr indict Joe Biden, Obama and unspecified others over their supposed roles in the investigation into his 2016 campaign\u2019s links to Russia.\u201cUnless Bill Barr indicts these people for crimes, the greatest political crime in the history of our country, then we\u2019re going to get little satisfaction unless I win and we\u2019ll just have to go \u2013 because I won\u2019t forget it. But these people should be indicted. This was the greatest political crime in the history of our country. And that includes Obama and it includes Biden,\u201d Trumpsaid.Trump privately pressured the Justice DepartmentTrump suggested in that Fox News interview that he might have raised the subject of Biden and Obama indictments with Barr, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, he\u2019s got all the information he needs. They want to get more, more, more, they keep getting more. I said, \u2018You don\u2019t need any more. You\u2019ve got more stuff than anybody\u2019s ever had.\u2019\u201dTrump privately pressured the Justice Department and Trump administration officials to go after other political opponents, according to former officials and news reports. And it appears he was sometimes successful, though it\u2019s impossible to definitively prove a direct relationship between his demands and the department\u2019s actions.Sessionstold special counsel Robert Muellerthat Trump pressured him in 2017 to abandon hisrecusalfrom investigations related to the 2016 election in order to prosecute Clinton, according to the Mueller report. Sessions did not do that, but heannounced in March 2018that he had (in November 2017) appointed a federal prosecutor to look into a variety of allegations against Clinton. She wasnever charged.The New York Timesreported this yearthat in April 2018, Trump told aides that if Sessions didn\u2019t prosecute Clinton and Comey, Trump would prosecute them himself \u2013 prompting his White House counsel to write him a memo outlining the limits of the president\u2019s powers.Boltonwrotein a 2020 book that Trump was \u201cobsessed\u201d with having Kerry prosecuted for supposedlybreaking a rarely enforced old lawbyremaining in contactwith Iranian officials after leaving office to try to preserve the nuclear agreement Kerry helped to negotiate. Bolton wrote that \u201cin meeting after meeting in the Oval (Office), Trump would ask Attorney General William Barr or anybody listening to launch a prosecution.\u201dThe same week in 2018 that Trump tweeted that Kerry might have broken the law, the Justice Department assigned federal prosecutors to investigate Kerry,according to a bookby former federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman, who wasousted by Trump in 2020. Then, the same day Trump tweeted about Kerry in 2019, a Justice Department official called one of the prosecutors to apply more pressure over the case, Berman wrote. Kerry was never charged.In 2019, Barr satisfied Trump\u2019s investigate-the-investigators demand bytaskinga federal prosecutor to help investigate the origins of the FBI\u2019s probe related to Russia and the 2016 election. In late 2020, with about three months left in Trump\u2019s presidency, Barr gave that prosecutor, John Durham,the status of special counsel.And in early 2020, Barrtaskeda different federal prosecutor with taking in information from members of the public,notably including then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, related to allegations about the Bidens and Ukraine, which had been a subject of Trump\u2019s public and private focus."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Democrats outspend Republicans on airwaves in crucial House races, with California and New York leading the way", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/house-election-tv-advertising/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Democrats have outspent Republicans ontelevision advertisementsin the races that will be crucial to decidingcontrol of the US House of Representatives, with California and New York seeing the highest spending by the two parties, according to a CNN analysis of advertising data from the first full month following the end of primary season.Both California and New York, while deep-blue at the statewide level, are home to buckets of highly competitive House seats that were key to Republicans gaining their narrow majority two years ago.Outside groups are playing an influential role in the race for the House, with a pair of leading super PACs from both parties collectively accounting for about a quarter of the $378 million in ad spending, while a wild card \u2013 a super PAC funded by cryptocurrency interests, which backs a bipartisan slate of pro-crypto candidates \u2013 dumped nearly $15 million more into the advertising fray.And the ads from some of the top spenders reflects the key issues that are driving voters, including the economy \u2013 always a top concern \u2013 as well as abortion rights, immigration, and crime.California and New YorkBetween September 11, the day after the last US House primaries finalized general election matchups across the country, and October 10, California and New York combined to draw about 29% of all ad spending targeting House races. Ten House races in California and six in New York are currently rated as competitive byInside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales.Republicans in both states are defending several seats that are held by lawmakers who won close contests in 2022 but thatJoe Bidenwould have carried two years earlier under the current lines.In New York, they include the 4th\u00a0Congressional District, held by freshman Rep.Anthony D\u2019Esposito, and a pair of upstate seats also represented by first-term lawmakers, Marc Molinaro (19th\u00a0District) and Mike Lawler (17th\u00a0District).The GOP is also trying to hold on to several competitive seats in California, mostly in territory that backed Biden in 2020. The vulnerable members include a pair of Central Valley congressmen \u2013 Reps. David Valadao of the 22nd\u00a0District and John Duarte of the 13th\u00a0District. Also on the list are Reps. Mike Garcia of the 27th\u00a0District and Michelle Steel of the 45th\u00a0District, both in the Los Angeles area, and Rep. Kevin Calvert, whose 41st\u00a0District in the Inland Empire would have narrowly supportedDonald Trumpfour years ago.Top contestsWith those series of highly competitive contests beckoning, both California and New York have been flooded with ad money from outside groups, while grassroots donors, responding to battleground appeals, have helped the candidates push ad spending totals even higher. California, in particular, saw twice as much House ad spending in the month since the last primaries as any other state.And in the top 20 House contests for ad spending between September 11 and October 10, Democrats combined to outspend Republicans in 17 of them by a net of more than $30 million in total.The three races where Republicans led in ad spending wereNebraska\u2019s 2nd\u00a0District, California\u2019s 22nd\u00a0and Iowa\u2019s 3rd \u2013 all three seats that the party is defending.In a few races \u2013 such as D\u2019Esposito\u2019s seat in New York; Duarte\u2019s seat in California; Pennsylvania\u2019s 7th\u00a0District held by three-term Democratic Rep. Susan Wild; Colorado\u2019s 8th\u00a0District, home to freshman Democrat Yadira Caraveo; and Washington\u2019s 3rd\u00a0District, where Democratic Rep.Marie Gluesenkamp-Perezis seeking a second term \u2013 Democrats established large advertising leads in the first full month following the primaries, ranging from about $3 million to $4 million.Across all House races, a few leading outside groups from both parties accounted for a significant share of the ad spending totals. Congressional Leadership Fund, the top House GOP super PAC, spent nearly $60 million, 16% of the total in the month, while its Democratic counterpart, House Majority PAC, spent about $35.5 million, which was 9% of the ad spending total on House races over the 30-day period.Top advertisers and issuesCollectively, Congressional Leadership Fund and House Majority PAC accounted for more than a quarter of all the ad spending in the first full month since the last primaries, and the content of their TV ads reflects the messaging priorities for both parties.According to AdImpact data, Congressional Leadership Fund spent about $42 million on broadcast TV ads in those 30 days, and 39%\u00a0went to ads that referencedimmigration, the top ranked issue in its advertising; CLF also spent more than a quarter of its total ad budget on spots that referencedcrime, and alsotaxes.On the other side, House Majority PAC spent more than $25\u00a0million on broadcast TV ads over the same period, and abortion rights dominated its TV ads more than any other issues by a wide margin \u2013 about 71%\u00a0of the super PAC\u2019s broadcast TV spend went to ads referencingabortion. HMP also spent nearly 40% of its TV ad budget on spots referencing crime, in many cases warning against thecriminalizationof abortion, while ads aboutcharacteraccounted for about 17% of its spending.In addition, Fairshake, a super PAC funded by cryptocurrency interests, has seized an influential role in the campaign, spending nearly $15 million since the final primaries on ads backing a bipartisan slate of industry-friendly candidates in 17 races. The spots praise the candidates\u2019economic policiesand legislative records onother key issues.Looking aheadCampaigns and outside groups routinely book advertising time far in advance, and those future ad reservations are subject to change as candidates and their allies adjust their bookings and spend more campaign money.With three weeks to go before votes are counted in the 2024 election, though, House races in California and New York were poised to continue dominating the landscape, while Democrats held an overall edge in remaining future ad reservations.Including bookings between\u00a0October 11 and Election Day, all advertisers in House races have combined ad reservations totaling more than $441 million, and Democrats lead Republicans by about $252 million to $183 million.California alone was set to see more than $89\u00a0million worth of advertising for House races over the final three and half weeks, while New York was set for more than $50 million\u00a0\u2013 together, about a third\u00a0of all the ad spending targeting the battle for the House in the crucial final stretch."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Fact check: What Trump keeps getting wrong about \u2018paper ballots\u2019", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/fact-check-trump-paper-ballots/index.html", "content": "WashingtonCNN\u2014After losing the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump has championed the baseless lie that the results were tainted by widespread fraud.To fix this made-up problem, Trump has proposed a four-part solution: The US should switch exclusively to paper ballots, requireproof of citizenshipto register to vote, require voters to show ID at the polls, and eliminate mail-in voting by holding the entire election in-person on just one day.Policymakers can debate the merits of forcing voters to prove their citizenship and provide ID. And mail-in voting, widely used by both Democrats and Republicans, isn\u2019t going anywhere.But Trump\u2019s comments on \u201cpaper ballots\u201d havepuzzled voting expertsand election officials \u2013 because almost all voters nationwide already use paper ballots.Facts First:Trump\u2019s insistence that the US switch to \u201cpaper ballots\u201d is nonsensical. More than 98% of voters live in jurisdictions that produce fully auditable paper trails, according todata from Verified Voting, which tracks election equipment in every county.Trump brings up his four-part proposal almost every time he speaks about election integrity. He has mentioned the \u201cpaper ballots\u201d claimdozens of timesthis year alone.\u201cWe\u2019re going to fix our elections so that our elections are going to be honorable and honest, and people leave, and they know their vote is counted,\u201d Trump said at anAugust rallyin Potterville, Michigan. \u201cWe are going to have free and fair elections. And ideally, we go to paper ballots, same-day voting, proof of citizenship \u2013 very big \u2013 and voter ID.\u201dIn aninterviewlast month, Trump said one way to \u201csolve this problem\u201d of mass fraud was to \u201cgo to paper ballots.\u201d At arallyin Johnstown, Pennsylvania, he said, \u201cwe want to go to paper ballots.\u201d And hesaid, \u201cwe want paper ballots,\u201d in Montezuma Pass, Arizona.Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group, has spent the past two decades urging counties to move away from paperless voting in favor of in-person polling sites. (Vote-by-mail obviously incorporates a paper trail.) The people who run the group say they have accomplished their goal \u2013 despite claims from Trump and others that the US still needs paper ballots.\u201cIt\u2019s really weird and I don\u2019t understand it,\u201d said Mark Lindeman, the group\u2019s director for policy and strategy. \u201cAlmost everybody votes on paper ballots. Anyone who is convinced that we need paper ballots is very likely voting on paper ballots themselves.\u201dOnly about 1.4% of registered voters live in counties where there\u2019s no paper trail of their ballot if they vote in-person, according to Verified Voting\u2019s data. (If they vote-by-mail, then there is a paper trail.) These holdouts are the entire state of Louisiana and a few Texas counties.For everyone else, there are paper trails that can be checked during a post-election audit or recount.Nearly 70% of registered voters live in counties where voters physically mark their choices on a paper ballot.Another 25% of voters live in counties that use \u201cballot-marking devices,\u201d where voters use a touchscreen or another interface to select their candidates, and then the machine fills out a paper ballot to reflect their selections.The remaining 5% of voters use electronic machines that record votes directly into the computer\u2019s memory. But even most of these machines now create paper trails, too. The holdout counties in Texas and the entire state of Louisiana only store the votes on the computer memory.The share of voters in \u201cpaperless\u201d counties has been steadily shrinking with every election cycle over the past 20 years, according to Verified Voting.Sherry Poland, elections director in Hamilton County, Ohio, which includes Cincinnati, said her county switched to hand-marked paper ballots in 2006, and that the system creates a \u201cbackup\u201d and \u201credundancy\u201d that should inspire confidence in the integrity of the process.\u201cThe trend is coming back now and everyone is realizing the value of having a paper trial,\u201d said Poland, a Republican.After the 2016 election, battleground states like Pennsylvania andGeorgiatransitioned away from paperless machines and now use systems with paper trails. And since 2020, Tennessee and many counties in New Jersey, Texas, and Mississippi made the switch too.False and nonsensical claims about election procedures have had a negative impact on voter perceptions on the integrity of US elections, especially among Republicans.A majority of Trump supporters in Michigan, Arizona, and Pennsylvania now say they\u2019re \u201cnot at all confident\u201d or only \u201cjust a little\u201d confident the results will be accurately tallied in their state, according torecent CNN polling. And one in five of Trump supporters said in a recentABC/Ipsos pollthat they aren\u2019t prepared to accept the results of the election.\u201cTwenty years ago, Verified Voting was founded to get rid of paperless (voting machines),\u201d Lindeman said.\u201cAnd now we\u2019ve just about made it.

Walz, the Minnesota governor, said the idea a president could use troops against Americans made him \u201csick to my stomach.\u201dAnd the Army National Guard veteran highlighted a comment by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley that Trump was a \u201cfascist to his core,\u201d which was reported in Bob Woodward\u2019s new book \u201cWar.\u201d Walz added: \u201cLet that sink in, and don\u2019t be a damn bit afraid of saying it, because that\u2019s exactly who he is.

Biden won the county by 1 percentage point in 2020, but the former president carried the county by nearly 2,000 votes in 2016 on the way to the White House. The city of Erie is a Democratic stronghold, but the fight between Harris and Trump will be intense among moderate voters in the suburbs and Trump will seek to run up huge margins in rural and farming communities.The twice-impeached former president appeared at a town hall event in Oaks, northeast of Philadelphia, with South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who is a star in the conservative media firmament.The event highlighted issues like the cost of living and housing that Trump\u2019s team sees as the key to the election. One of the most critical questions before undecided voters in the coming days is whether pressures bearing down on many American families \u2014 for instance, over high grocery prices \u2013 will outweigh concerns about Trump\u2019s extremism and threats to democracy.Harris was not the only candidate tending to a vital constituency on Monday.

And that opening may representformer President Donald Trump\u2019s best chance to tip the states that remain most likely to decidethe razor-thin presidential race.Even as Trump struggled with other groups of women in his 2016 and 2020 presidential races, exit polls and other analyses showed that he amassed a big lead each time among White women without a college education.Those working-class White women loom as a critical, potentially even decisive, factor in Trump\u2019s third White House bid. That\u2019s partly because so many of them, polls show, are torn between personal disdain for Trump and discontent with the results ofJoe Biden\u2019s presidency, particularly over inflation and the border.But it\u2019s also because these women are especially plentiful in the three former \u201cblue wall\u201d states that stillconstitute Harris\u2019 most likely pathto an Electoral College victory: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. To win those states, which she is barnstorming every day this week, Harris doesn\u2019t have to win most of those women \u2013 Democrats almost never do \u2013 but she does need to remain competitive with them.\u201cThey are really tired of Trump, and they\u2019d really like to move on, but they are also nervous about moving on, and they do think the economy was better for them under Trump,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. As for Harris, Lake said, \u201cThey like she would bring everybody together, they like her empathy. \u2026 But they don\u2019t feel that they know her that well.\u201d The sum total of these contradictory impulses is that, \u201cThey are really torn,\u201d Lake said. \u201cThey feel very insecure about these choices.\u201dOne measure of how much Democrats prioritize these blue-collar White women is the massive voter contact program that American Bridge 21st Century, a party super PAC, is targeting at them. The group is spending about\u00a0$140 million to try to reach 3 million women, predominantly White women without a college degree, just in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the three states that Trump in 2016 knocked out ofwhat I termed the \u201cblue wall.\u201dVice President Kamala Harris attends a campaign event in Flint, Michigan, on October 4, 2024.Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters\u201cIn general, the blue wall states are still the path of least resistance to 270\u201d for Harris, said Bradley Beychok, a co-founder of American Bridge 21st Century. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s pretty clear that women are the determinative demographic of this election cycle, and they have been the last few election cycles, so it\u2019s not rocket science.\u201dAmerican Bridge has pursued these blue-collar women through an extraordinarily long engagement that began in 2023 by regularly mailing them newspapers produced by an affiliated group. The effort has included multiple rounds of contacts and testimonial ads from former Trump voters delivered through every available platform, from television and digital to mail and streaming services. Beychok said one of the group\u2019s strongest messages is reminding voters of the uncertainty and volatility that comes with Trump.Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a rally at the Dort Financial Center in Flint, Michigan, on October 4.Mark Schiefelbein/APRelated articleHarris advisers zero in on Michigan strategy to overcome anticipated losses among some parts of Democratic coalition\u201cIf you show folks, gee you put this guy back in the White House and you\u2019ll have a sense of unrest and disorder in your community \u2026 people say, \u2018I don\u2019t want that,\u2019\u201d Beychok said. Similarly, he added, \u201cIf Donald Trump is proud that he made good on his threat to ban abortion, and overthrow Roe v. Wade, and you know he\u2019s an agent of chaos, then what [rights] will\u201d he threaten next?Beychok said the group\u2019s guiding principle is that even small gains with these women can prove decisive across narrowly divided states. \u201cWe may not get to 50.1 with them, but if we run a program to get what is available to us \u2026 it can be just as effective,\u201d he said.In fact, winning a majority of these women has not been a realistic goal for Democrats. In exit polls dating to 1980, the only Democratic presidential nominee who carried even a plurality of White women without a college degree on a national basis was Bill Clinton in 1996. Democrats stayed close among these women again in the razor-thin 2000 race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. But while White womenwitha college degree have trended toward the Democrats in the presidential campaigns since then, the White womenwithouta college degree have moved sharply in the opposite direction.The Republican presidential nominees won just under three-fifths of these working-class White women in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 races, while Trump pushed his share with them over three-fifths in both the 2016 and 2020 races, according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. Other well-respected analyses of the 2016 and 2020 vote likewise showed Trump winning about three-fifths of these women,with the Democratic targeting firm Catalistputting Trump just below that threshold each time,and the Pew Research Center\u2019s Validated Votersstudy putting Trump just underneath it in 2016 and just above it in 2020.Supporters of former President Donald Trump cheer during a campaign rally on October 9, 2024, in Reading, Pennsylvania.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe GOP advantage in those national figures is inflated by its imposing advantage among these women in Southern states, where many of them are culturally conservative evangelical Christians who support the GOP in overwhelming numbers.Critically for Democrats, in the pivotal battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, they have usually run a few points better with these women than they do nationally. In Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection victory, for instance, he only won about one-third of these women nationally, but he carried about 45% of them in both Michigan and Pennsylvania and won a narrow majority of them in Wisconsin, the exit polls found. By contrast, in 2016, Hillary Clinton,the exit polls found, stalled out at around 40% support from them in all three states, which contributed to her losing Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by a combined margin of roughly 80,000 votes \u2013 and with them the presidency.Compared with Clinton in 2016,Biden in 2020 posted a small but critical improvement among these women in Michigan and Wisconsin, contributing to his victories there,exit polls found. Biden ran only about as well as Clinton did with them in Pennsylvania, where he flipped the state primarily by vastly expanding on her margin in the heavily college-educated suburbs of Philadelphia.GREENVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA - OCTOBER 13: Democratic presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally at the Williams Arena at Minges Coliseum on the campus of East Carolina University October 13, 2024 in Greenville, North Carolina. With 22 days until the election, recent polls in North Carolina show Harris and her opponent Republican presidential candidate, former President Donald Trump within just a point or two on average, which is also the case in the other six key battleground states. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesRelated articleHarris unveils new proposals targeting Black men as she looks to shore up Democratic coalitionWorking-class White women in the former blue wall states may be even more central to Harris\u2019 fate than they were to Biden\u2019s. Even most Democrats acknowledge Harris may struggle to fully match Biden\u2019s showing among almost all the major groups of male voters, especially White men without a college degree, as well as Black, Latino and younger men.Because Biden won Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by a combined margin of nearly 260,000 votes, Harris has a cushion to sustain some erosion among men. But Lake, like many other Democrats, believes that to win the three big Rust Belt battlegrounds \u2013 and for that matter,anyof the swing states \u2013 Harris will likely need to run at least slightly better than Biden did among women. \u201cShe is going to have to do better with women,\u201d Lake said flatly. \u201cShe has to make up for the fact that she won\u2019t do as well with the men as he did.\u201dPolls show Harris has a good chance at improving over Biden\u2019s 2020 performance with one group of women in all of the battlegrounds, including the former blue wall states: White women with at least a four-year college degree.In the 2022 midterm \u2013 the first election held after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion \u2013 the Democratic gubernatorial nominees in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsinall ran notably betteramong these women than Biden had two years earlier.Recent surveys by Quinnipiac Universityshowed Harris also drawing about two-thirds of these college-educated White women in all three of the former blue wall states,as did a recent Wisconsin poll by the Marquette Law School.Harris\u2019 position is less certain among women of color. Many polls have shown her facing some decline compared with 2020 among bothBlackandLatinowomen, but Democrats feel more confident about her ability to regain most of that ground than they do about her odds of undoing the shortfall with minority men, especially Latinos.That leaves the working-class White women as the biggest wild card among female voters.\u201cThey are weighing a lot of things,\u201d said Republican pollster Christine Matthews. \u201cThey could very well be deliberating up until the very last minute.\u201dTheir choices will be especially important in the former blue wall states because the blue-collar White women are so numerous there.In a new analysis shared exclusively with me, William Frey, a demographer at the nonpartisan Brookings Metro think tank, has calculated that these White women without a college degree will comprise a huge share of eligible voters in these pivotal states. According to his analysis of the latest census data, they will represent over one-fourth of adults eligible to vote in both Michigan and Wisconsin and almost exactly one-fourth in Pennsylvania. In all three states, he found they represent roughly as big a share of the eligible voting population as the blue-collar White men who are Trump\u2019s strongest group and a bigger group of eligible voters than either White men or women with a college degree, or non-White men or women. Every vote from every group, of course, counts the same, but the blue-collar White women are a big enough bloc that even minuscule shifts in their preference, or turnout, could easily tip these precariously balanced states.One word from Trump\u2019s speech during a recent Wisconsin rally offers the best window on how he is pursuing these working-class White women. Talking about undocumented migrants, he declared, \u201cThey will walk into your kitchen, they\u2019ll cut your throat.\u201d Trump didn\u2019t say immigrants would walk through the front door or into the living room. He specifically said they would come into akitchen, where many women, particularly in working-class households, can easily envision themselves alone and vulnerable.Former President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Dodge County Airport on October 6, 2024, in Juneau, Wisconsin.Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APThat was just one salvo in the barrage of messaging from Trump and his allies \u2013 in speeches and in advertising \u2013 that seeks to simultaneously trigger fears of crime from undocumented immigrants, portray Harris as too weak and too liberal to protect people from it, and to present himself as the strongman, in all senses of that word, who can provide that protection.Jackie Payne is the founder and executive director of Galvanize Action, a liberal group that studies moderate White women, primarily those without college degrees. She acknowledges that Trump\u2019s alarms have resonated among working-class White women, especially older ones. These women, she said, \u201cexpress some of the fear around the border crisis; safety and security of their family is a top priority, and they identify the border crisis as a threat.\u201dBut at the same time, Payne said, for many of these women, the vehemence and vitriol of Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrants \u2013the dehumanizing language and lurid accusations\u2013 is also triggering their greatest concern about him: that he\u2019s too divisive, disruptive and chaotic.Trump, Payne said, is \u201cmaking the bet\u201d that voters fearful about their safety will accept language and threats from him about immigrants that they consider \u201cugly\u201d if they believe such vehemence to be \u201c the price of strength and protection.\u201d But, she added, \u201cAt the same time, we see a revulsion and disgust at the way we are talking about other humans.\u201dRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania Ed Fry Arena, Monday, Sept. 23, 2024, in Indiana, Pa. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)Alex Brandon/APRelated articleThe unexpected gender dynamic shaping the 2024 electionTrump\u2019s other big asset with these women is the economy. Many working-class White women live with very little economic margin, and pollsters agree the cumulative increase under Biden in the cost of living \u2013 notwithstanding inflation\u2019s decline over recent months \u2013 has almost eclipsed any of his other economic accomplishments, such as the strong job market.\u201cIf you are just getting by and living paycheck to paycheck, that increase in basic groceries did a number on you and you are very focused on the economy,\u201d said GOP pollster Jon McHenry.McHenry said in his polling, significantly more of these blue-collar women say they were doing better economically under Trump than Biden.The latest national New York Times/Siena surveyreinforces that finding: Among White women without a college degree, 54% said Trump\u2019s policies had helped them personally, while a nearly identical 53% said Biden\u2019s policies had hurt them, according to unpublished results provided by Siena. These women may feel a stronger personal connection with Harris than they did with Biden, McHenry noted, but poll results such as those make clear they don\u2019t believe \u201cthat things are magically better because Joe Biden withdrew from the election. They are still feeling the effects of inflation; they are still not happy about the border.\u201dCollege-educated White women don\u2019t give Biden\u2019s policies great ratings in the Times/Siena poll either. But both Mathews and Payne point out that\u2019s almost irrelevant to the decision for most of them: Trump himself provides the motivation for their vote. \u201cWhen I look at White college women, I see them as motivated by choice, abortion and defeating Donald Trump,\u201d said Matthews. \u201cThey are negatively motivated by him; they want him gone.\u201dIn the 2022 exit polls, a solid majority of blue-collar White women also backed abortion rights across Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to results provided by the CNN polling unit. The Democrats\u2019 problem is not that these women don\u2019t support legal abortion; it\u2019s that fewer of them prioritize it as much as their female counterparts who are college-educated, single or younger.\u201cFor White non-college women, even if they are offended by some of this stuff coming out of the Trump and Vance campaigns, the misogynistic comments, they are really focused on being able to feed a family of four on their income,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cThey are cross-pressured and they don\u2019t like what they are hearing. But they think he would do better on the economy and prices would go down, and that is the most pressing and relevant issue.\u201dIn one of her campaign\u2019s most notable achievements, Harris has become more competitive on economic issues; even if more voters still say they trust Trump to handle the macro-economy, she\u2019s narrowed the gap in multiple polls on questions such as holding down costs or who cares about people like me. Her recent media offensive seemed aimed, above all, at buttressing those perceptions: across the many podcasts, town halls and talk show appearances the most powerful through line in her message seemed to be to say to women: I have lived your life, so I understand what public policy must do to make it easier and more secure \u2013 with everything from a restored child tax creditto Medicare coverage for home health carefor more seniors.Supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris hold up signs during a campaign event in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, on September 13, 2024.Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersPayne said the key for Harris is to \u201cat least draw even on \u2018you can trust me to deliver for your family.\u2019\u201d If she can do that, Payne said, more working-class women will feel comfortable voting for \u201ca vision of America that they want to raise their kids in. They don\u2019t want conflict, they don\u2019t like the polarization and division.\u201dThe toughest question for Democrats is how Harris\u2019 gender may affect the decisions of these working-class White women across the Rust Belt. To this day, some Democrats believe one key reason Clinton narrowly lost the former blue wall states in 2016 was that too many of these women remained uneasy with a female president, particularly around issues of security.In polling this fall, Payne\u2019s group found that Trump holds a big lead over Harris among White women who score high on what social scientists call \u201cinternalized sexism\u201d \u2013 a tendency to defer to men \u2013 while Harris held a commanding lead among those who scored low on that measure.A recent national Gallup Pollpoints in a similar direction. White women without a college degree were far more likely to identify Trump than Harris as a strong leader and someone who would display good judgment in a crisis, according to unpublished results provided by Gallup. Not only college-educated White women, but also the equivalent White men were much more likely than the blue-collar White women to express positive views about Harris and negative ones about Trump, Gallup found.\u201cI think there is a lot of implicit [gender] bias with\u201d these working-class White women, Lake said. \u201cAnd given the short time frame, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re on top of it. They have competing notions of Trump. On the one hand, he\u2019s chaotic, unstable, he\u2019s definitely looking older, he is dividing people, he is causing instability in communities. But on the other hand, they think he\u2019s a strong man and they like strong men.\u201dHow a few thousand conflicted and ambivalent working-class White women in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin sift through these competing views may decide the statesthat remain the most likely to determine the next president."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Bob Woodward issues a stark warning on Trump weeks from Election Day", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/bob-woodward-book-review/index.html", "content": "Editor\u2019s Note:The story below contains explicit language.CNN\u2014The arrival of a newBob Woodward bookhas a well-established choreography; enterprising reporters get hold of copies of the heavily embargoed volume a week or so ahead of its publication date and mine it for the news it contains.BothCNNandThe Washington Post,where Woodward retains the honorific title of associate editor, covered the news in the latest book, \u201cWar,\u201d last week.And news there was: At the height of the pandemic, PresidentDonald Trumpsent Russian President Vladimir Putin a secret shipment of Covid-19 testing equipment, and since he has left office, Trump has called Putin as many as seven times.Ahead of Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, PresidentJoe Bidenblamed former President Barack Obama for not doing more to counter the Russian leader when he invaded Crimea in 2014, telling a friend, \u201cThat\u2019s why we are here. We fucked it up. Barack never took Putin seriously.\u201dPutin had a heated call with Biden in the run-up to Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, in which the Russian president threatened a nuclear war. Later, Biden\u2019s national security team assessed there was a 50% chance Putin might use a tactical nuclear weapon during the Ukraine conflict.

Even before \u201cWar\u201dgoes on sale Tuesday, it\u2019s already No. 5 on Amazon\u2019s bestseller list, so it could also be on the way to being Woodward\u2019s 16th No. 1 New York Times bestseller, an astonishing record of success.Woodward has a penchant for one-word titles for his books about Trump: \u201cPeril,\u201d \u201cRage\u201d and \u201cFear.\u201d He has also written extensively about the post-9/11 wars in books such as \u201cBush at War\u201d and\u201cObama\u2019s Wars.\u201d So how does\u201cWar\u201d stack up against those books, and what are its big themes?At the heart of \u201cWar,\u201d Woodward reports about how Biden\u2019s national security team handled three wars: in Afghanistan, the Ukraine conflict, and the war in Gaza, now in its second year, which has embroiled the Middle East in a widening conflict.Like Woodward\u2019s several other books about war, the front lines of the conflicts he covers are not on the battlefields but in the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room.

It\u2019s clear from a close reading of \u201cWar\u201dthat almost every top national security official in the Biden administration spoke with him. Those officials did so surely because they understood that if they didn\u2019t talk to Woodward, their peers certainly would. So, if they wanted to get their version of history told, it only made sense to cooperate with the legendary reporter, who, at age 81, has more energy and puts in more shoe leather than reporters half his age.Typically, in Woodward\u2019s books, he lets his reporting speak for itself and doesn\u2019t make sweeping pronouncements that tell the reader about his own conclusions, but\u201cWar\u201dis different. Woodward, who has covered every president since Nixon, writes that Trump is \u201cnot only the wrong man for the presidency, he is also unfit to lead the country. Trump was far worse than Richard Nixon, the provably criminal president. \u2026 Trump was the most reckless and impulsive president in American history.\u201d Ouch!By contrast, the final sentence of \u201cWar\u201dasserts, \u201cBased on the evidence available now, I believe President Biden and this team will be largely studied in history as an example of steady and purposeful leadership.\u201dBiden\u2019s Afghan withdrawal fiascoYet, that conclusion of steady and purposeful leadership is quite at odds with the fiasco of thechaotic US withdrawalfrom Afghanistan in the summer of 2021, which handed the country back to the Taliban, and during which a suicide bomber killed 13 American service members and some 170 Afghans. This was an own goal scored by Biden\u2019s decision to goagainst the advice of his top generals, who told him the withdrawal of the small contingent of 2,500 US troops then in Afghanistan would lead to the collapse of the Afghan military.Collapse it did, and now the Taliban rule over Afghanistan with aniron, misogynistic fistenabled by many billions of dollars of military equipment that the US left behind. The Taliban are also accommodating some 20 terrorist organizations,according to the United Nations.The Afghanistan withdrawal also signaled to Putin that the US was withdrawing from the world in general, which seems to have accelerated his plans to invade Ukraine. Woodward\u2019s reporting underlines this point. He writes that top generals at the Pentagon learned that a few weeks after the Afghanistan withdrawal, \u201cnew pieces of intelligence were coming in that suggested Russia was planning a large-scale military attack on Ukraine.\u201dBiden then dispatched CIA Director Bill Burns, who had dealt with Putin during his stint as US ambassador to Russia, to warn the Russian leader that the US knew he was planning an invasion of Ukraine and to try to dissuade him. Along with Burns on the trip to Russia was the National Security Council director for Russia, Eric Green. According to Woodward, Green \u201cpicked up a sense that the Russians were feeling kind of full of themselves after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u201d Green told Woodward, \u201cI think it reinforced Putin\u2019s conception about how easy it would be. \u2026 Here\u2019s a military force that has been supported by the US for decades at that stage. They just collapsed. The Americans didn\u2019t back them up.\u201dBiden gets it right on UkraineBy contrast, the Biden team did show real leadership when it tried to warn the world of Putin\u2019s impending invasion of Ukraine and then, when it happened, steadily supplied the Ukrainians with weapons and substantial aid so that they have held off the Russians for more than two and a half years. This has all been achieved without any American boots on the ground, a key Biden goal for the war.In the lead-up to the invasion of Ukraine, Biden and his team warned in private discussions with the Ukrainians and NATO allies that, based on their intelligence, Putin was close to invading. They also innovated by making this intelligence public. Not surprisingly, this was met with some initial resistance from the US intelligence community, yet it was smart policy. After all, secrecy serves policy; it is not a policy goal in and of itself.On December 3, 2021, The Washington Postran a storyheadlined, \u201cRussia planning a massive military offensive against Ukraine involving 175,000 troops, U.S. intelligence warns.\u201d Although this declassification of intelligence didn\u2019t, in the end, stop Putin from invading Ukraine, it likely made NATO allies and the Ukrainians better prepared for how to respond once the invasion began.Two women watch US President Joe Biden making statements on a news channel in a subway station turned into a shelter in Kyiv on March 8, 2022.Vadim Ghirda/AP/FileIf the Afghanistan withdrawal was a spectacular own goal scored by Biden himself since he was the leading proponent of the policy, the Biden administration\u2019s response to the Ukraine invasion was about as good as it gets. Biden wanted to support the Ukrainians substantially but did not want to trigger World War III inadvertently. That policy has largely been a success. When US intelligence found that Putin was seriously contemplating using a tactical nuclear weapon, the Biden administration \u201cmobilized every communication line, calling the Chinese, the Indians, the Israelis, the Turks \u2014 countries friendly with Russia\u201d to get them to tell Putin to stand down. He did.One of Putin\u2019s key goals when he invaded Ukraine was to ensure the country never joined NATO. Instead, because of the invasion, Putin made NATO Great Again. Multiple NATO countries started ramping up their own spending on defense, and the alliance added two new members, the formerly neutral states ofSwedenandFinland, Russia\u2019s neighbor.While the war has stalemated now with a slight advantage to the Russians, who are advancing slowly in eastern Ukraine, in August, the Ukrainians seized hundreds of square miles of territoryin the Kursk regionof Russia itself, which they have retained. No matter how much Putin\u2019s propagandists proclaim that victory is close, the Russians are estimated to have already suffered 600,000 dead and wounded, according to a Pentagon briefing last week.The Middle East regional war Biden tried to avoidA year afterHamas attacked Israel, killing some 1,200 Israelis, the Biden team has not prevented an escalating regional conflict. Instead of showing purposeful leadership, the Biden administration has repeatedly handed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a blank check, which he has used to carry out large-scale attacks not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank and Lebanon, as well as more targeted operations in Syria and Yemen.The war is Gaza has claimed the lives of 42,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, while the death toll in Lebanon is more than 1,500 since Israel launched a ground operation there in recent weeks, and a million Lebanese have fled their homes,according to the UN.President Joe Biden leaves the room at the end of a press conference following a solidarity visit to Israel on October 18, 2023, in Tel Aviv.Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, the Houthis in Yemen have effectively shut down shipping through thekey Red Sea global trade routeusing Iran-supplied missiles and drones and have also fired them at Israel. In the past six months, Iran has launched two massive attacks on Israel using ballistic missiles and drones, widening the war to the regional conflict that the Biden administration was strenuously seeking to avoid when Hamas launched its attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023.The possibility of a ceasefire with Hamas and the return of the hostages held by the terrorist groupseems quite remoteat this point since the leader of Hamas in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, and Netanyahu are unwilling to compromise, and both seem to believe that the continuation of the war benefits their interests.On Sunday, the Israeli Cabinet met to decide how to respond to the most recent Iranian missile strike on Israel two weeks ago. Biden has urged the Israelis not to strike Iranian nuclear sites. Let\u2019s see whether they listen. The record so far has not been encouraging.Biden\u2019s unwavering support for Netanyahu even has a name \u2014 \u201cthe bear hug\u201d\u2014 and while the president has occasionally protested publicly about the level of casualties in Gaza, the de facto policy is strong support for Israel; for instance, the Biden administration is going forward with the sale of $18 billion of F-15 fighter jets to the country.Earlier this year, the Biden administration tried without success to get Netanyahu not to attack the densely populated Gazan city of Rafah, where an estimated 1.5 million Palestinians were sheltering, many of them evicted from their homes earlier in the conflict.Biden called Netanyahu on February 15, 2024, telling him, \u201cWe already said we are not going to support an operation absent a plan to get civilians out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d Netanyahu ignored this warning and went ahead with the attack on Rafah. Woodward\u2019s assessment of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u2019s efforts to rein in Netanyahu during this period is damning and direct: \u201cIt was obvious Blinken had no influence.\u201dIt\u2019s mystifying why the Biden administration hasn\u2019t used more of its considerable leverage over Netanyahu; after all, in the past year, the US has approved $17.9 billion for security assistance to Israel, according to a report by Brown University released last week; the most aid in any year that the US has ever sent to Israel. The Biden administration has halted the shipment of massive 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, but otherwise, the large flow of American weapons to the Jewish state continues.Vice President Kamala HarrisThough Vice President Kamala Harris adorns the cover of \u201cWar\u201d\u2014 likely a marketing decision given her presidential run \u2014 she does not play a prominent role in the book compared with Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and national security adviser Jake Sullivan.Yet, when Harris appears in the book, she does give sound advice. When Biden asked her what her view was in mid-April after Iran had fired some 300 missiles and drones at Israel, almost all of which were then shot down by Israel, the US and other allies, Harris said simply, \u201cTell Bibi to take the win.\u201dVice President Kamala Harris gives remarks alongside President Joe Biden at Prince George\u2019s Community College on August 15, 2024, in Largo, Maryland.Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesHarris also has one of the funnier lines in the book, saying Biden likes her company because \u201che knows that I\u2019m the only person around who knows how to properly pronounce the wordmotherfucker.\u201d Indeed, we learn from Woodward that \u201cJoe from Scranton\u201d sure does use the F-word a lot, particularly when it comes to Netanyahu, who Biden variously describes as one of \u201cthe biggest fucking assholes in the world,\u201d \u201ca bad fucking guy\u201d and \u201ca fucking liar.\u201d And for good measure, Biden yells at Netanyahu, \u201cBibi, what the fuck?\u201d after the Israelisassassinated a Hezbollah leaderliving in a densely populated area of the capital of Lebanon, also killing at least three civilians.\u201cWar\u201d is a deeply reported account of the wars on the Biden administration\u2019s watch. At the same time, its overall assessment that the Biden team showed purposeful leadership regarding these conflicts isn\u2019t supported by the facts of the Afghan withdrawal, the present conflagration in the Middle East, and even Woodward\u2019s own reporting. However, regarding Ukraine, the Biden administration has operated very deftly, keeping NATO together and expanding the alliance while avoiding any direct American involvement in the war that might have triggered an escalatory response from the Russians. Certainly, this is a real achievement that Biden can savor when he enjoys his well-earned retirement back in Delaware.It is anyone\u2019s guess what Trump might do about Ukraine if he were to win the presidency, given the former president\u2019s odd bromance with Putin, which even top aides such as Trump\u2019s director of national Intelligence, Dan Coats, cannot explain. Coats told Woodward, \u201cIt\u2019s still a mystery to me how he deals with Putin and what he says to Putin. \u2026 It\u2019s an enigma, and it hasn\u2019t been broken yet.\u201dTrump has claimed he could quickly settle the Ukraine conflict, but since the Russians and Ukrainians have been at war for a decade since Putin first seized Crimea in 2014, this seems like wishful thinking."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Why education level has become the best predictor for how someone will vote", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/the-biggest-predictor-of-how-someone-will-vote/index.html", "content": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter.

Wade turned the US into a country with abortion-rights states and abortion-ban states.The extent to which former President Donald Trump can siphon off support for Vice President Kamala Harris amongvoters of color, Latinos and Black men, in particular, could be consequential in states where close margins are expected.Rural voters generally side with Republicans, urban voters generally side with Democrats and whoever can get an edge in thesuburbswill win in November.But there is an even more important thing dividing voters, according to the longtime Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik, who was former President Bill Clinton\u2019s political director and is known for incisivedeep-dive memos.The education gap grows\u201cThe biggest single, best predictor of how someone\u2019s going to vote in American politics now is education level. That is now the new fault line in American politics,\u201d Sosnik told David Chalian on the \u201cCNN Political Briefing\u201d podcast.Trump\u2019s rise over the past three election cycles, Sosnik argued, \u201caccelerated and completed this political realignment based on education that had been forming since the early \u201970s, at the beginning of the decline in the middle class.\u201dAs the US transitions to a 21st century economy, there\u2019s a rift between the people who attain education \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s become the basic Democratic Party,\u201d he said, comparing them with people who feel left behind, \u201cthat group of voters is now the modern Republican Party base.\u201dCNN Political BriefingThe Two Things That Will Decide The ElectionElection Day is just a little over three weeks away, and there\u2019s still no clear leader in this race. With Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump still neck-and-neck, all eyes are on the battleground states. Doug Sosnik is a longtime Democratic strategist who\u2019s known for his deep-dive political memos. He joins CNN Political Director David Chalian to share his insights on the current state of play and why he thinks the next 25 days are all about Harris\u2019 ability to close the deal with voters who may not feel naturally aligned with her. He also explains why this election could yield the biggest gender gap in American political history.Oct 11, 2024 \u2022 28 min...Apple PodcastsSpotifyTuneInRadio.comiHeart RadioPandoraAmazonRSSInequality growsThere\u2019s data to back this up, as Sosnik has previouslywritten. In an August report on growing income inequality in the US, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis documented that for every dollar of wealth in a household headed by a college graduate, a household headed by a high school graduate has 22 cents. The figure rises to 30 cents for households headed by someone with some college, but no degree.Put another way, college graduates hold about three-quarters of the wealth in the US, but account for only about 40% of the population.There\u2019s a direct correlation to politics. In 2020, according toCNN\u2019s exit polls, voters with a college degree accounted for 41% of the electorate and they supported President Joe Biden 55% to Trump\u2019s 43%. Trump got the support of about two-thirds of White voters without a college degree, but he lost White college-educated voters.Sorting states by education levelSosnik went a step further, arguing to Chalian that the seven or so battleground states that could be won by either Trump or Harris also tend to be right in the middle on education levels, \u201cnot skewing too much college-educated voters and not too much non-college. That\u2019s the only reason they\u2019re different than the rest of the country,\u201d he said.TheLumina Foundationhas a report that uses census data to rank states by educational attainment, including post-high school certifications and associate degrees. It\u2019s true that most of the battlegrounds \u2013 Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in the Rust Belt and Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona in the Sun Belt \u2013 all fall near the average. There is also one important exception. Nevada, which is a battleground state, has one of of the lowest levels of educational attainment in the US. While most of the states with the highest educational attainment are blue states in the northeast, Utah, a red state, is also near the top of the list.The real swing votersTo the extent that traditional swing voters are persuadable in this election, Sosnik argued they might be people like political independents or Nikki Haley Republicans.But there\u2019s a second group of swing voters Sosnik argued\u00a0is\u00a0even more important.\u00a0Those voters aren\u2019t\u00a0choosing between a candidate, but rather deciding whether to vote at all.For Trump, these are non-college-educated White voters in general, particularly men, who \u201cif they vote, you know they\u2019re going to vote for Trump,\u201d he said. For Harris, they might be women who don\u2019t normally participate in the process, but will this year, the first presidential election since the Supreme Court allowed some states to ban most or all abortions.Young voters, who are less reliable to cast ballots, also fall into this second type of swing voters, Sosnik said.Trump\u2019s entire success in politics has been built around appealing not to independents, but to those who \u201caren\u2019t traditional voters,\u201d he said.The educational realignment could also change how we view presidential elections versus off-year midterms, he said.\u201cUp until Trump, Democrats always did better in presidential years because infrequent voters were Democratic,\u201d Sosnik argued. \u201cRepublicans always did better in off years because the high propensity voters were Republican. That\u2019s completely flipped on its side now.\u201dListen to the podcast here. It also includes Sosnik\u2019s current state of the race, where the vice president appears to have reached a plateau, but might yet break for Harris if she can \u201cstep up and close the deal\u201d with swing voters."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump\u2019s extreme vision for America hikes pressure on Harris", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/trump-extreme-vision-harris-pressure-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Donald Trumpis invoking a vision of an extreme new White House term that would transform America and rock the world.And Vice President Kamala Harris has only three weeks to avert it, as she struggles to restore momentum in a neck-and-neck race to Election Day.The Republican nominee is escalating the most toxic anti-immigrant rhetoric in modern US history, warning outsiderswith \u201cbad genes\u201dhave \u201cinvaded\u201d the country afterfalsely claimingthat Haitian migrants here legally were eating pets in Ohio.

Even if Harris were leading in national surveys, there are fears that, like Hillary Clinton before her, she could win the popular vote but fall short in the Electoral College.The tightly balanced race three weeks out shows that while he\u2019s an aberration from traditional presidential candidates, Trump is offering something millions of Americans want. Republicans argue that Harris-Biden policies caused a spike in inflation the White House tried for months to downplay. Trump cites the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan to argue the current White House is seen as weak around the world. And after failing to tackle the policy or political ramifications of immigration earlier in Biden\u2019s term, Democrats offered Trump a huge opening on a critical issue.Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris walks to board Air Force Two as she departs for New York, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on October 7, 2024.Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersRelated articleDemocrats\u00a0grow\u00a0anxious as Election Day nearsThe close contestalso suggests that despite Trump\u2019s unapologetic extremism, Democrats have failed for the third election in a row to produce a candidate and a message that can give them any reassurance about the election result. While liberals and moderates might be horrified by the strongman leadership Trump proposes, he\u2019s winning on what voters consistently say is the top election issue: the economy. In the ABC News/Ipsos poll, for example, 59% say it\u2019s getting worse, even though the job market is robust, inflation is far from its highs and interest rates are easing.With the nation in such a sour mood, Harris\u2019 incumbency as vice president is a liability.

Harris has spelled out policies to help people buy and rent homes, to ease the cost of health care and to revive a bipartisan border bill that Trump killed. But it\u2019s still often hard in her interviews to spot a powerful rationale for her campaign. Trump\u2019s vow to deport migrants, torch US trade competitors with tariffs and fix a world spinning out of control looks forceful by comparison, even if extreme.Video Ad Feedback'Bad news for Democrats': Data reporter shows where GOP is making big gains04:29- Source:CNNStill, Democrats looking for reassurance might note that Trump tops out at 48% or below in most polls.

And what the network called a \u201csliver\u201d were still unclaimed. In states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and Georgia, even late shifts in support could be decisive.The eventual makeup of the electorate will also be crucial.

Can she stem her opponent\u2019s advances among Black male and Hispanic voters?

He told CNN Political Director David Chalian on the\u201cCNN Political Briefing\u201dpodcast that the presidency may depend on which candidate finally brands themself as a change agent.Trump\u2019s campaign released a memo Sunday claiming that question had already been answered.\u00a0\u201cShe can\u2019t convince the voters that she is \u2018the change agent\u2019 in the race, that she will be better on the economy, inflation, immigration, crime, or improving people\u2019s financial situation,\u201d the memo said. \u201cThe bottom line is that voters say President Trump will do a better job.\u201dBut Sosnik said the campaign is \u201creally going to boil down to Harris and whether she can stand up to the pressure and the scrutiny and whether she can create a permission structure for people who don\u2019t want to vote for Trump but are concerned about Harris.\u201d He warned: \u201cThey don\u2019t feel like she has given them enough reason to vote for her \u2026 she is not doing that right now.\u201dHarris\u2019 task is complicated by the lack of opportunities to take on Trump directly. The former president, who has spent weeks lambasting her for avoiding the press, rarely strays from his comfort zone of conservative media and Fox News, where he enjoys adulation rather than cross-examination. He is dodging a second presidential debate against Harris and pulled out of a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview before critiquing the vice president\u2019s performance on the show.\u00a0And whereas in 2016, when Trump\u2019s rallies were hard to escape on cable television, the performances now rarely get end-to-end coverage outside conservative media, meaning that many voters may not appreciate his extreme and increasingly disjointed antics.Obama seemed baffled during a campaign appearance for Harris in Pennsylvania last week at his predecessor\u2019s enduring appeal among millions of voters. \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anyone but himself,\u201d Obama said. \u201cDonald Trump sees power as nothing more than a means to an end.\u201dBut Trump \u2014 despite his two impeachments, his criminal conviction, and his attempt to destroy democracy to stay in power \u2014 is within reach of the presidency again with a more radical agenda than before.Sen. Chris Murphy has been sounding the alarm in recent days with a string of increasingly frantic posts on X. Reacting to Trump\u2019s description of undocumented migrants last week as \u201crapists\u201d and the \u201cworst criminals in the world,\u201d Murphy wrote that such rhetoric portends \u201ca dystopian country\u201d with open-air prison camps and the rule of law suspended. \u201cWe cannot let this happen.

FormerPresident Donald Trump\u2019s campaign also faced renewed focus on his legal troubles in the wake of a new filing by federal prosecutors, the survey finds.In the wake ofHurricane Helene, which has killed more than 230 people across the southeastern United States,\u00a0\u201churricane\u201d was the word most frequently mentioned when respondents were asked what they\u2019d heard about Trump.

Harris also previously saw bursts of attention after endorsements from Oprah Winfrey and Taylor Swift.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgThe sentiment behind the words Americans used to describe what they\u2019d heard about Harris remained modestly more positive than the words they used to describe the news about Trump.

For Harris, the negative shift is apparent across parties, with sentiments expressed by Democrats, Republicans and independents all tilting slightly more negative in the new data than in the week prior. For Trump, though, sentiment has held steady among Republicans, while shifting slightly less negative than the previous survey among independents and Democrats.The latest poll found that just under two-thirds of Americans (64%) reported seeing, reading or hearing something about Harris, compared with 68% who said the same about Trump. It marks the fourth straight week in which more people reported hearing about Trump than they did about Harris, and it\u2019s a notable drop from the previous week in the shares saying they\u2019d heard about each candidate (Trump down 7 points, Harris down 5).The overall level of attention to the presidential candidates now is lower than it was at this point in previous cycles, though that may be a side effect of debate timing.

Vance, who suffers from more of an image deficit among both viewers and the public at large, boosted his standing among the debate audience, outperforming expectations and gaining\u00a0ground on the share who perceive him\u00a0as qualified. He was also narrowly seen as doing a better job than Walz of defending his running mate. Both men, the poll finds, are viewed by a majority of debate watchers as qualified to assume the presidency if needed.

In June,two-thirds of debate watchersthought that formerPresident Donald TrumpoutperformedPresident Joe Biden, while a 63% majority who tuned in to the September debate between Trump andKamala Harrissaid thatthe vice president did the better job.Views of the vice presidential hopefuls split largely along pre-established political lines Tuesday night: 90% of debate watchers who support Trump\u2019s candidacy said\u00a0that Vance did the better job, while a slightly narrower 82% of the Harris supporters who tuned in saw Walz as the winner.The poll\u2019s results reflect opinions of the debate only among those voters who tuned in and aren\u2019t representative of the views of the full voting public. Debate watchers in the poll were 3 percentage points likelier to be Democratic-aligned than Republican-aligned, making for an audience that\u00a0was\u00a0about 5 points more Democratic-leaning than all registered voters nationally. That\u2019s a difference from the audience for the two presidential debates this year, both of which were slightly more GOP-leaning than the potential American electorate overall. What voters who don\u2019t tune in hear about an event\u00a0in the following days can often be as impactful as immediate views of the event itself.Following the debate, 59% of debate watchers said they had a favorable view of Walz, with just 22% viewing him unfavorably \u2013 an improvement from his already positive numbers among the same voters pre-debate (46% favorable, 32% unfavorable). Debate watchers came away from the debate\u00a0with roughly neutral views of Vance: 41% rated him favorably and 44% unfavorably. That\u2019s also an improvement from their image of Vance pre-debate, when his ratings among this group were deeply underwater (30% favorable, 52% unfavorable).Among debate watchers, Walz boosted his favorability far more among women than men, while Vance\u2019s gains were about the same among voters of both genders.

By contrast, views of Vance tilted negative, with 30% of registered voters rating him favorably, 42% unfavorably, and 27% offering no opinion.A 65% majority of debate watchers now say Walz is qualified to serve as president if necessary, with 58% saying the same of Vance.

But that advantage falls short of the Biden-Harris campaign\u2019s 75-point margin among Black voters, according toexit polls from 2020.Since Harris\u2019 entrance into the race, enthusiasm among Black voters about the election appears to have grown. In the latest poll, 79% of Black registered voters say they would definitely vote, up from 68% in the June poll. For voters overall, that stood at 82% in the latest poll, about the same as in June. Black voters now are just as likely as other voters to say it is extremely important that they, personally, vote (both at 63%), while in June, Black registered voters were less likely to say the same (57% among Black voters, 66% overall).Harris\u2019 improvement over Biden\u2019s margins from earlier this year comes as the poll finds broad support for her from the 40% of Black likely voters who view Biden\u2019s presidency as a failure \u2013 Harris leads Trump 65% to 31% among these voters.The poll suggests Trump\u2019s improvements among Black voters relative to 2020 are driven largely by Black voters under the age of 60. Harris leads among Black voters aged 60 and over by 87 points, almost identical to Biden\u2019s 85-point margin in 2020, according to exit polls for the same group. This shrinks to a 55-point lead for Harris among Black voters younger than 60 (Biden won this group by 71 points in 2020, according to exit polls). Trump performs best among Black likely voters younger than 40, with 22% support.President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign rally at Girard College on May 29, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/FileStill, CNN\u2019s poll suggests that Harris has the potential to improve her margins. Her supporters are broadly locked in and unlikely to shift in the race \u2013 92% of Black likely voters who support Harris say their minds are already made up. But among those backing other candidates, a third say they may yet change their mind.Harris is also generally viewed more favorably among Black registered voters compared with registered voters overall, even after accounting for Black voters\u2019 overwhelming Democratic lean. Nearly 8 in 10 Black voters view Harris favorably, and Black Democrats view Harris slightly more positively than others in the party, while Black voters outside the Democratic Party offer far more positive views of her than do independents or Republicans of other races.Black voters who don\u2019t consider themselves Democrats are more likely than non-Democrats of other racial backgrounds to say that Harris has improved their view of the Democratic Party; that they would be proud or excited if she wins the election; and that her views are generally mainstream, with Black Democratic voters offering similar or modestly more positive views than others in their party. Among non-Democrats, Black voters also rate Harris as more aligned with their vision of a president than do other voters across all the attributes tested in the poll, including temperament, ability to understand the problems of people like themselves and leadership skills.That carries over to views of Trump too. Non-Democratic Black voters are more likely to view Trump\u2019s presidency as a failure than other voters who share their partisan perspective and are less likely to trust Trump over Harris on handling each of the issues tested in the poll, including the economy and immigration.While Black likely voters are largely focused on the same issues as the broader electorate, the CNN polling does find some differences among Democrats. Black likely voters are just as likely as all other groups to consider the economy their top issue (41%). Democratic Black likely voters, however, are twice as likely as Democratic likely voters overall to consider the economy their top issue (42%, compared with 19%). Democratic Black likely voters are also less apt than Democratic likely voters overall to say that protecting democracy or abortion and reproductive rights are their top issue.When asked which economic issue is most important to them, Black voters across the political spectrum are generally aligned with the overall electorate and put inflation at the top of the list. But Black likely voters are more likely than other voters to name jobs and wages as the top economic issue and less likely to say federal spending.Nearly 9 in 10 Black registered voters say the political system in the United States is in need of a major overhaul or major reforms, and a large majority (85%) say that the federal government does not do enough for Black Americans. Roughly half of Black voters (47%) say that the federal government does both too much for White Americans and too little for Black Americans. Still, Black registered voters are more likely than the broader electorate to say that they are satisfied with the influence people like themselves have on the political process (52%, compared with 38% overall).The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS online and by telephone September 19-22, 2024, among 2,074 registered voters nationwide drawn from a probability-based panel. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year\u2019s election. The survey included an oversample of Black registered voters to reach a total of 579; this group has been weighted to its proper size within the population for all survey results. Results for the full sample of registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.0 percentage points; it is the same among likely voters and larger for subgroups. Results among Black registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 7.8 percentage points; among Black likely voters, it is plus or minus 7.7 percentage points.CNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta and Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Promises Donald Trump has made so far in his campaign for a second term", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/04/politics/trump-campaign-promises-dg/", "content": ""}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Promises Kamala Harris has made so far in her campaign", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/politics/kamala-harris-key-issues-dg/", "content": ""}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump wants to renegotiate his\u00a0own\u00a0trade deal with Mexico and Canada", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/usmca-trump-renegotiate/index.html", "content": "WashingtonCNN\u2014Former President Donald Trump is once again pledging to save American manufacturing and bring back jobs by rewriting a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.But this time, instead of replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as NAFTA, which he has often described as the \u201cworst trade deal ever made,\u201d he wants to renegotiate his own trade deal.Trump signed onto theUS-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, in 2018. It took effect in January 2020 and replaced NAFTA.In 2018, Trumpsaidthe USMCA would be \u201cthe most modern, up-to-date, and balanced trade agreement in the history of our country, with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed.\u201dBut now, he thinks it can be improved.\u201cUpon taking office, I will formally notify Mexico and Canada of my intention to invoke the six-year renegotiation provision of the USMCA that I put in,\u201d Trump said last week during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.The USMCA includes a clause that requires a review by the three signatory countries at the six-year anniversary.When asked by\u00a0Fox News\u2019\u00a0Maria Bartiromo in an interview\u00a0that aired\u00a0Sunday about his plan to renegotiate the USMCA, Trump said it would not undermine the deal he put together.\u201cI want to make it a much better deal. I want to take advantage, now, of the car industry,\u201d he said.Harris also wants to review the USMCAVice President Kamala Harris has also said she would use the USMCA review process.Harris, who is now the Democratic presidential nominee, was one of 10 US senators who voted against USMCA at the time.\u201cI knew it was not sufficient to protect our country and its workers,\u201d she said in a statement last week.Following the Senate vote in 2020, Harrissaidshe was concerned the USMCA\u2019s environmental provisions did not go far enough to address climate change.Here\u2019s what\u2019s in the USMCAMuch of USMCAsimply updated the 25-year-old NAFTA.One of the biggest changes was a new incentive to build cars and trucks in North America. USMCA requires 75% of a vehicle\u2019s parts to be made in one of the three countries \u2013 up from the previous 62.5% rule \u2013 in order to remain free from tariffs when moving across borders.It also required more vehicle parts to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour.The trade deal created sweeping new benefits for the technology sector, in a chapter on digital trade that wasn\u2019t part of the original NAFTA.Strong labor rules and environmental protections were also included."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump campaign tries to push immigration issue over Bill Clinton\u2019s comments on Laken Riley", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/bill-clinton-laken-riley-campaign/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is highlighting former President Bill Clinton\u2019s comment Sunday that Georgia nursing student Laken Riley\u2019s death \u201cprobably wouldn\u2019t have happened\u201d if migrants, including her alleged killer, had \u201call been properly vetted.\u201dClinton\u2019s remark came as he lambasted Trump for scuttling a bipartisan border security bill earlier this year. The bill sputtered in January when Trump\u2019s opposition to it led Republican support to erode.

MontanaSen. Jon TesterAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileDemocrat Jon Tester, who\u2019s running for a fourth term in a state Trump has twice carried by double digits, remains the most vulnerable Senate incumbent this year. Republicans feel confident their nominee,Tim Sheehy, has an edge \u2013 and both Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales and the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter have shifted their rating of the once toss-up race toward the GOP.Democrats still see a path to victory for Tester, who has a proven history of defying the partisan lean of his state by communicating both what he\u2019s done for Montanans and painting a contrast with his opponents.Democrats are trying that playbook against Sheehy, trying to define the wealthy businessman and retired Navy SEAL, who moved to Montana in 2014, as an out-of-state carpetbagger who cannot be trusted. Recentlyunearthed audio recordingsof Sheehy using racist stereotypes to refer to Native Americans has played into that message, with Democrats arguing that he\u2019s alienating a crucial demographic in the state. In a debate earlier this week, Sheehy acknowledged his comments were \u201cinsensitive,\u201d saying, \u201cI come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color sometimes.\u201dTester\u2019s campaign is now leaning into abortion rights on the airwaves \u2013 an issue that\u2019s on the ballot in Montana this year.

OhioSen. Sherrod BrownBonnie Cash/Getty Images/FileDemocratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing his toughest reelection in a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 points. Public polling still shows the three-term senator ahead of GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, although that is expected to tighten as more Republican voters come home to Moreno.

But the reassuring news for Democrats: Brown was winning 10% of Trump voters.Democrats have seized on Moreno\u2019s recent comments at a town hall suggesting that some suburban women were single-issue voters when it comes to abortion and questioning why women over 50 would care about the topic. Brown pointed to the remarks as evidence that his opponent is out of step with the 57% of Ohio voters who last year approved a ballot measure protecting reproductive rights.

Debbie StabenowAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileMichigan remains the most competitive open seat on this list. Democrat Elissa Slotkin has held a narrow edge in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, but the absence of an incumbent and the competitiveness of the presidential race in the Wolverine State\u00a0makes it one that could come down to the wire.Slotkin, a third-term congresswoman, led Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers 47% to 42% among likely voters in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll, with Slotkin drawing 6% of likely voters who also said they would vote for Trump. Slotkin has a strong fundraising record \u2013 her campaign announced raising $18 million in the third quarter \u2013 but Republicans are pouring more money into this state, with the Senate Leadership Fund recently announcing a $22.5 million investment.Slotkin has been runningads on abortion\u2013 an issue that has helped propel recent Democratic victories in the state. Herspotsclaim that Rogers\u2019 past support for abortion restrictions makes him untrustworthy on the issue now. \u201cI\u2019m scared that Mike Rogers will continue to take away my rights,\u201d says one woman in a spot who says she needed an abortion to save her life.Rogers has been responding on air, speaking directly to camera while holding hands with his wife inone new spot,saying he respects Michigan voters\u2019 decision on abortion rights and \u201cwon\u2019t do anything to change it\u201d in the Senate.Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, scored the endorsement of the state Farm Bureau\u2019s PAC, which had previously backed Stabenow (the chair of the Senate Agriculture panel). Rogers, whom Democrats have attacked for living in Florida after he left Congress a decade ago, is runningspotsthat tout his Michigan roots and public service.

Bob CaseyAndrew Harnik/Getty ImagesDemocratic Sen. Bob Casey\u2019s race against Republican challenger Dave McCormick moves two spots up on the list in light of heavy GOP outside spending, some tighter polling and the competitiveness of the presidential race in a\u00a0state that is part of Democrats\u2019 so-called blue wall of must-win states.September polling from Marist, Quinnipiac University, the New York Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer, Franklin & Marshall, CBS News/YouGov and Fox News all gave Casey anywhere from a 5- to 9-point lead among likely voters. Polls from CNN and The Washington Post around the same time, however, showed no clear leader.The two candidates, who met on the debate stage for the first time Thursday night, have been hitting the airwaves with competing messages, as have their allied outside groups. Democrats are going after McCormick onabortion,includingonead that features footage of him referring to himself as \u201cpro-life.\u201d The Senate Leadership Fund, which is adding $28 million to GOP sending here, and the pro-McCormickKeystone Renewal PAChave been attacking Casey over inflation andimmigration.McCormick\u2019s tenure as the CEO of FreeMarkets \u2013 a Pittsburgh-based software company \u2013 has also been featured in ads on both sides.The Democratic group WinSenateis accusing him ofoutsourcing jobsand pointing to his management of the company to argue that \u201cConnecticut Dave\u201d\u00a0 \u2013 he owns a home in the Nutmeg State \u2013 \u201cwants to buy our Senate seat.\u201d McCormick is running ads featuringformer FreeMarkets employeespraising him and touting the company\u2019s hiring policies.6. WisconsinSen. Tammy BaldwinMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesWisconsin also moves up two spots on the list amid signs that some Republicans could be drifting home toward their party\u2019s nominee, Eric Hovde, in his challenge to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.The two-term senator maintained a modest edge over Hovde in aMarquette University Law School pollreleased this week \u2013 51% to 45% among likely voters when third-party candidates are included and 53% to 46% in a head-to-head matchup. Baldwin had a similar 7-point lead in aNew York Times/Siena College surveyof the two-person race\u00a0taken around the same time.While Baldwin has repeatedly outraised Hovde, the Senate Leadership Fund is also pouring funds \u2013 $17 million \u2013 into the Badger State, and Hovde has plenty of his own money to pay for ads at the lower candidate rate if he chooses. (We\u2019ll be eying his third-quarter fundraising filing for details about how much the Sunwest Bank CEO had loaned his campaign through September.) Ads from Hovde \u2013 whose campaign recently underwent a shakeup \u2013 havesought to tie Baldwinto Harris, attacking her over border security, fentanyl andtransgender rights.But Baldwin, who\u2019s made an effort tovisit the red, rural parts of Wisconsin, has a well-defined brand. She picked up theendorsementof the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation this week \u2013 a notable get for a Democrat running statewide. Much of Democratic advertising has played up Hovde\u2019s past controversial comments and sought to cast him as a California carpetbagger \u2013 he owns property in Laguna Beach, even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin and his family\u2019s company is a prominent state brand.7. ArizonaSen. Kyrsten SinemaAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileArizona is a conservative-leaning purple state, where Republicans should ordinarily be able to pick off a Senate seat \u2013 especially an open one. But in the race to replace retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, Republican candidate Kari Lake seems to have hit a ceiling.The 2022 gubernatorial nominee is well known in the state, but not necessarily for the right reasons. She still refuses to accept her loss for governor and, despite tethering herself to Trump, is underperforming his polling numbers.Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego led Lake by 10 points among likely voters in aMarist polland 13 points in aFox News survey, both from mid-September.

Jacky Rosen appears to be in a stronger position against Republican opponent Sam Brown in a state where Democratic prospects seem to have picked up since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.Rosen, who appeared at a Harris rally in Las Vegas earlier this week, led Brown by 10 points in aCNN pollin late August. Like Lake in Arizona, Brown \u2013 an Army veteran who first ran for office in Texas and lost the GOP primary for Nevada\u2019s other Senate seat last year \u2013 also appears to be running up against a ceiling.Rosen and Democrats are hitting Brownover his previous stances on abortion\u2013 which is on the ballot this year in Nevada. Brown, who says he supports current state law legalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks, has said he\u2019d \u201cclose the door\u201d on backing a national abortion ban.Rosen has had a fundraising edge over her opponent, and this week, national Republicans canceled their remaining independent expenditures in the state in favor of running hybrid ads with Brown, which allows them to benefit from the lower candidate rate in the ultra-pricey Las Vegas media market \u2014 a strategy they\u2019ve employed in races across the country to try to compete with well-funded Democratic candidates on the airwaves.9. TexasSen. Ted CruzTierney L. Cross/Getty Images/FileNational Democrats\u2019 decision toinvest TV resourcesin Texas was the first major signal the party is putting money where its mouth is on the competitiveness of the Lone Star State this year. Democrats see Republican Sen. Ted Cruz as unpopular and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred, as the man to beat him, even in a state that is still comfortably red at the presidential level.The first hybridadbetween Allred and the DSCC features Kate Cox, the woman who had to leave the state to seek an abortion after her fetus had been diagnosed with a deadly condition, and Amanda Zurawski, who sued the state after she was denied an abortion when experiencing complications. \u201cIf you\u2019re experiencing pregnancy complications in Texas, you\u2019re in danger,\u201d Zurawski says in the ad, \u201cand it\u2019s Ted Cruz and the anti-abortion extremists\u2019 fault.\u201dAllred has also tried to flip the script on Republicans byaccusing Cruzof \u201cdoing nothing to secure the border.\u201d Cruz, in turn, isattacking Allredover a vote related to the inclusion of transgender athletes in women\u2019s sports. \u201cBoys and girls are different,\u201d is how anotheradfrom the Republican opens. \u201cThis election is about keeping Texas Texas,\u201d Cruz has said.Cruz only beat Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke by 3 points in 2018. But Democrats hope that Allred, a former NFL player who flipped a Dallas-area House seat the same year, is a more formidable challenger and can turn out more minority voters. (Allred would be the state\u2019s first Black senator if he wins.)Even Republicans acknowledge that Allred is running a good race, and the NRSC is investing here to help Cruz and the state party. Still, Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, so this remains an uphill battle for Allred.10. MarylandSen. Ben CardinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/GettyImages/FileThe race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin remains in tenth place this month as Angela Alsobrooks fights to keep this seat in party hands. Joe Biden won Maryland by 33 points in 2020, but Republican nominee Larry Hogan \u2013 a popular former two-term governor \u2013 has a supportive super PAC committing $18 million to tout hisindependence.Alsobrooks, the Prince George\u2019s County executive, led Hogan by 11 points in a recentWashington Post/University of Maryland poll. She\u2019s become better known statewide and has made gains among voters who say they care about Democrats maintaining control of the Senate. The argument that Hogan would be another vote for Senate Republicans has been Democrats\u2019central pitchin deep-blue Maryland, especially onabortion rightsand Trump.Voters in the Post survey were split over whether Hogan would back his party\u2019s leaders in the Senate. He\u2019s winning nearly half of independents, as well as 18% of Democrats. And as he tries to combat Democratic attacks over abortion rights, he\u2019s run ads about being\u201cthe ultimate girl dad\u201dand \u201cone of the few Republicans who never caved\u201d to Trump. Hogan rejected the former president\u2019s endorsement earlier this year, but Democrats quickly seized on Trump saying that he\u2019d like to see Hogan win.Maryland\u2019s Future, the super PAC backing Hogan, is trying to localize the race byattacking Alsobrooksfor improperly taking advantage of tax breaks she did not qualify for, as firstreported by CNN. (Her senior adviser told CNN that she was unaware of the problem and that her attorneys are working with both the District of Columbia and Prince George\u2019s County to resolve the issue.)CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "These are the states where abortion rights will \u2013 or could \u2013 be on the ballot in November", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/28/politics/state-abortion-ballot-measure-vote-dg/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014This November, voters in at least 10 states will take to the polls to determine the future of abortion access in their state, after a nationwide effort by organizers to secure a wave of ballot measures aimed at restoring or protecting the right to an abortion \u2014 and some aimed at restricting it.Abortion rights advocates hope the effort will restore the issue of reproductive health access to the people, after the Supreme Court\u2019sDobbs decisionoverturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the national right to an abortion.Most of the proposed ballot measures aim to enshrine the right to an abortion in state constitutions.\u00a0They follow a series of restrictivetrigger lawsthat went into effect following the Dobbs decision, along with abortion policies that were handed down by politicians or decided by state supreme courts since the decision.Anti-abortion organizers backed a handful of initiatives aimed at restricting abortion access, thoughsimilar restrictive measures have failedin the few states where votes have been held in the past couple of years.Abortion measures on the ballot in NovemberTen states \u2014\u00a0Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and South Dakota \u2014 have already secured abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. All eyes are on Florida, which has served as a critical access point for people seeking services in a region of the country that is fast becoming anabortion care desert. A six-week abortion banreplaced the state\u2019s 15-week banon May 1.Nebraska Secretary of State Robert Evnen announced in August that for the first time in the state\u2019s history, two conflicting petition efforts made the same ballot.Now voters in Nebraska will voteon whether abortion rights will be enshrined in the constitution or whether the state\u2019s current 12-week ban will be preserved.In this May 2023 photo, hundreds of people gather at the Nebraska Capitol to protest against a proposed abortion ban.Margery Beck/APRelated articleNebraska ballot can include competing measures to expand or limit abortion rights, high court rulesAfter organizers secured the New York Equal Rights Amendment on the 2024 ballot, it was briefly struck from the ballot by a state judge. State Attorney General Letitia James appealed that decision, and a state appeals court restored the measure to the ballot in June.A measure in Missouri\u00a0that\u00a0seeks to broadly protect reproductive care\u00a0has made it onto the ballot, while\u00a0an opposing\u00a0measure to permanently ban abortion never made it out of the state\u2019s legislative session.States with potential abortion ballot measuresOrganizers in states across the country have continued to work to secure funding, gather signatures and jump through the legal hoops necessary to secure abortion measures on the 2024 ballot.In most states, the process entails collecting a certain number of signatures by a designated deadline, while others require the additional step of having the ballot language approved by a state court, according to campaign organizers. The abortion rights measures are largely backed by coalitions of reproductive health advocates, many of which have fundraised to secure the money to support the campaigns.Organizers in Arkansas collected and submitted signatures for a proposed abortion rights measure, but the Secretary of State rejected their petition, saying the organizers did not correctly submit paperwork regarding paid canvassers. The state\u2019s supreme court sided with the secretary, ensuring the measure will not be on the ballot this November.Lawmaker proposed measures in Iowa and Missouri to restrict or exclude the right to abortion in state constitutions did not make it out of legislative sessions. Lawmakers in Pennsylvania proposed a measure barring the use of public funding for abortions, which is unlikely to pass the state legislature.States that have voted on abortion post-DobbsSeven states have already seen a vote on abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and reproductive health advocates have been heartened by the overwhelming support for abortion access among voters. Every measure aimed at protecting abortion access has passed, while all measures to restrict it have failed.While support for abortion access is considered a given in states like California, organizers say these votes offer an important layer of legal protection for patients and providers \u2013 and send a message to elected officials about what voters want.CNN\u2019s Molly English contributed to this report."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "What happens if there\u2019s a tie in 2024?

To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.CNN\u2014When Robert F. Kennedy Jr.suspended his presidential campaign, he did it in the most complicated way.Get your head around this: Kennedy will take himself off the ballot in certain key states, but he is encouraging supporters to vote for him in safe red and blue states so that he can feature in a \u201ccontingent election\u201d if former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris tie.In the battleground states, Kennedy said he\u2019s supporting Trump.Could Kennedy actually feature in a \u201ccontingent election?\u201d Short answer: No. He could not take part unless he won electoral votes, something that does not seem to be mathematically possible. Perhaps he\u2019s envisioning an elector going rogue and supporting him in defiance of voters, but Kennedy did not share details of his thinking.For the facts about contingent elections, read on.With two presidential candidates fighting over a mere 538 Electoral College votes, a tie scenario is more than possible. It\u2019s actually kind of surprising there has only been one tied election so far, in 1800, between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.That tie was the result of a failure of coordination by Democratic-Republicans, but it led to the nation\u2019s first \u201ccontingent election,\u201d decided in the House of Representatives.Could a tie actually happen this year?Yes. While a tie is not a likely outcome, it is something to be ready for. Here is one plausible scenario for the 2024 election:If Harris wins Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada and a single electoral vote in Nebraska, all of which Joe Biden won in 2020, but she loses Pennsylvania and Georgia, there\u2019s a tie, 269-269.The website270 to Winalso has more tied-election scenarios.Unlike every other state, Maine and Nebraska award two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner of each congressional district. Those individual, competitive electoral votes in Maine and Nebraska become hugely consequential in potential tie scenarios.Make your own 269-269 scenario withCNN\u2019s interactive election map.What happens if there\u2019s a tie?If there\u2019s a 269-269 tie, or if a third party or independent candidate wins electoral votes and keeps a candidate from reaching an Electoral College majority of 270, the next step is the same. It\u2019s called a \u201ccontingent election.\u201dAccording to the12th Amendment, enacted in the wake of that divisive 1800 election, if no candidate gets a majority of the Electoral College votes, the new Congress, which would have just been sworn in on January 3, chooses the president. The Senate would choose the vice president.When would a \u2018contingent election\u2019 occur?According to an analysis by theCongressional Research Service, a contingent election would occur on January 6, immediately after members of Congress met to count electoral votes and determined that no candidate had a majority.There is a lot of information from that CRS report in this story. While it dates back to 2017, it\u2019s still a valuable resource.How would the process work?The nation would clearly be divided. Lawmakers could be torn between supporting their preferred candidate and the one their state\u2019s voters preferred.In a contingent election, the House selects the president and the Senate selects the vice president. House members can only choose from among the top three finishers in the Electoral College for president, and senators can choose from among the top two finishers for vice president. Kennedy would presumably need to win electoral votes \u2013 win a state or a congressional district in Nebraska or Maine \u2013 in order to be an option in a contingent election. There\u2019s no chance of that happening at the moment.Rather than voting as individuals, each state delegation in the House would get one vote, although how the state delegations select their preferred candidate is not spelled out.A simple majority, 26 state delegation votes, would appoint the new president.If state delegations in the House did not select a president by Inauguration Day, January 20, the new vice president selected by the Senatewould become temporary president. It is possible the Senate could select a vice president when the House is deadlocked, because in the Senate each senator would get one vote.If the Senate had not selected a vice president by January 20, the presidential succession plan in the 20th Amendment temporarily takes effect. First in line after the vice president is the speaker of the House, currently Mike Johnson, although it could be a different Republican or a Democrat if Democrats win a majority in the House this November.Does either side have an advantage?If the Electoral College already benefits smaller and more rural states, the contingent election process \u2013 in which each state, regardless of population, has an equal vote \u2013 gives them a huge advantage.California and Texas get the same say as Delaware and Wyoming in a contingent election. Plus, Washington, DC, which gets three votes in the Electoral College, would be cut out of the contingent election.There\u2019s nothing to require state delegations to honor the winner of their state\u2019s vote. And in closely divided states, the results in single seats, perhaps determined by gerrymandered congressional maps, could swing a delegation\u2019s vote.CNNRelated articleWhat to expect in the sprint to Election Day \u2013 and beyondHeading into the 2024 election, Republican lawmakers held a majority in 26 states, compared with Democrats, who held the majority in 22, with ties in Minnesota and North Carolina. Republicans in North Carolina have changed the state\u2019s congressional map, however, and it is likely to have a majority-Republican congressional delegation in January. Republicans are likely to maintain\u00a0their advantage next year, especially if voters are so split that they deliver a national tie at the top of the ticket.In Arizona, for instance, who is to say that a potential majority of Republican members of Congresswould vote for the Democratic candidate, even if Harris pulled out a narrow win there?Would Alaska\u2019s Democratic member of Congress, assuming she wins reelection, vote for the Democrat for president even though her state is likely to go for Trump in November?Why does this bizarre tie-break system exist?It\u2019s actually meant to be an improvement. The way the Electoral College was first assembled, electors voted for two candidates. Whoever got the most votes was president and whoever got the second-most votes was vice president.By the time political parties were forming \u2013 Federalists and Democratic-Republicans in 1800 \u2013 electors needed to coordinate to cast more votes for their presidential pick than their vice presidential pick.In the1800 election, a rematch of 1796, Jefferson\u2019s Democratic-Republicans beat incumbent President and Federalist John Adams.But the Democratic-Republicans were poorly coordinated or bad at counting and foolishly cast equal numbers of votes for their presidential pick, Jefferson, and his running mate, Burr.Out of pique, when the early version of the contingent election rolled around, the Federalists, who still controlled the House at that time, backed Burr. Despite the intervention of Alexander Hamilton, a noted Federalist, it took 36 rounds of voting to finally elect Jefferson.By 1804, the 12th Amendment was being ratified.Has a contingent election happened in the years since the tied election of 1800?Yes.In 1824, multiple candidates got votes in the Electoral College but none of them received a majority, triggering a contingent election.Amazingly, from today\u2019s perspective, all of the candidates who got Electoral College votes that year were from the same Democratic-Republican political party, although they were split into regional sects.Andrew Jackson won 40% of the popular vote and got the most votes in the Electoral College with 99 of the 131needed for victory. But the House ultimately picked his top rival, John Quincy Adams, whose father lost that 1800 election.Jackson would have his revenge with a victory four years later, and John Quincy Adams would round out his career as the only former president to be elected to Congress, the body that made him president.Another contingent election occurred with the 1836 race, but just for vice president. Virginia\u2019s electors did not like Robert M. Johnson, the running mate of election winner Martin Van Buren, and withheld their votes for him in the Electoral College. The Senate later elevated Johnson to the vice presidency in a contingent election.What about the disputed election of 1876?In 1876, when there was a contested outcome, the contingent election system was bypassed.That year, at the height of Reconstruction, the issue was not that no person got a majority in the Electoral College, but rather that three Southern states \u2013 Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina \u2013 sent multiple slates of electoral votes to Washington, DC, after the state elections were disputed. And in Oregon, there was a dispute over one elector.Congress created a special bipartisan commission, with one more Republican than Democrats, to determine which candidate should get the 20 disputed electoral votes. They ultimately gave the votes to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes even though Democrat Samuel Tilden got more popular votes.Hayes thenlargely ended Reconstruction, perhaps as part of a secret deal that gave him the White House.This story has been updated with additional developments."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "What to expect in the sprint to Election Day \u2013 and beyond", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/politics/election-2024-key-dates-dg/index.html", "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter.

The October 1vice presidential debatebetween Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrat, and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican, was likely the last meeting between the Democratic campaign led by Vice President Kamala Harris and the Republican campaign led by former President Donald Trump.While the scene is set for what pollsters expect could be an extremely close election,there will be unexpected developments between now and Election Day on November 5.Nobody expected President Joe Biden\u2019scampaign to implodeafter theshock of his performance at CNN\u2019s debate in late June. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Harris as his replacement.Nobody expected anassassination attempt against Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience.So we don\u2019t know\u00a0specifically\u00a0what will happen between now andElection Day, or what could come after, when the country\u2019s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect:Voting is well underwayCNNRelated articleYour personalized voter handbook for the presidential electionWhile Election Day isn\u2019t until November 5, most states allow some kind of early voting, either by mail or in person, and that process kicks into overdrive in October.Most Americans, nearly 70%, voted early or by mail in 2020, according tocensus figures, although that figure was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.The campaigns will be focused on getting out the vote in the few key battleground states they think are up for grabs. In 2020, Biden won five states that Trump won in 2016. Those states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 could again be the focus in 2024 when Harris, who turns 60 in October, takes on Trump.It\u2019s important to be sure you\u2019re registered to vote as soon as possible, which can usually be done online. Twenty-three states and Washington, DC, allow Election Day voter registration.Election Day and beyondUS law requires federal elections to take place on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that\u2019s November 5.People who don\u2019t vote early will hit their local voting location. Polls will close at different times around the country. Due to the rise of voting by mail, if key states are close, like they were in 2020, we probably won\u2019t know the winner on Election Day.Regardless, expect lawsuits in certain states and the potential for recounts in others. Election Day is far from the end of the election.Separately,Trump\u2019s sentencingon 34 counts of falsifying business records is now scheduled for November 26.Also this month: Biden turns 82.December: Electoral votes are castAfter questions about the election are settled, states confirm, or ascertain, their statewide results. Electors gather in their respective state capitols to cast electoral votes for their statewide winner.Nebraska and Maine also allocate some electoral votes by congressional district, and these could be pivotal in a close race.January: Someone will solemnly swearThe new Congress takes the oath of office on January 3. It\u2019s this new Congress that, in the unlikely event ofan Electoral College tie, would settle the election. Each state would get one vote for president in the House of Representatives.In any event, lawmakers gather on January 6, as everyone should remember from 2020, to count electoral votes. Harris will preside.

Now, he is as excited to vote for Harris as he is to knock doors organizing for her and other Democrats.\u201cAt the time, I was like kind of iffy, feeling like everybody else, kind of undecided,\u201d Johnson said of his choices before Harris got in the race. \u201cBut now that Kamala got the ball and she rollin\u2019 with it,\u00a0I feel like oh yeah. \u2026\u00a0She\u2019s making a good image for herself and for the Democrats.\u201dA year ago, Lang was blunt about Biden\u2019s struggles in Milwaukee\u2019s Black neighborhoods.

Both are part of a CNN project, calledAll Over the Map, designed to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are part of crucial voting blocs.In the twoprior conversations, both said Biden\u2019s age was a concern for many young voters who felt little connection to the octogenarian president.

He says his wife is excited, and that he shares her view that there is inspiration in the vice president\u2019s story.\u201cShe came up with immigrant parents, which to me, it\u2019s amazing for someone like that to come up and be able to be president,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hit for people.\u201dHe also has no patience when Trump slams immigrants or berates the country he wants to lead.\u201cOne of the things that hurts me the most is for him to talk down America,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cAmerica is a world leader. We have always been. \u2026 We\u2019re the best. No matter who is there. The people make it the best.\u201dBut Munoz said many friends and others he encounters at community events are nostalgic for the pre-Covid economy and think that Trump is a better choice for their bottom line. Nevada also elected a Republican governor in 2022, and Munoz believes that makes it more hospitable climate for Trump this year.\u201cHe has grown,\u201d Munoz said of the former president\u2019s support among Hispanics. \u201cI have friends that were Democrats who have turned the page. They feel that the country is not going in the right direction.\u201dHarris, though, is more competitive than Biden would have been and Munoz predicts a Nevada nailbiter.\u201cIt\u2019s a 50-50 tossup,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to be out here with a direct message and talking to the voters out here.

But Republicans have dominated of late. Trump won in both 2016 and 2020. Both\u00a0of the state\u2019s\u00a0US senators are Republican, as are six of Iowa\u2019s seven statewide constitutional offices.Voters who say life was better under Trump fear Democrats have shifted too far leftEbersole shared a view quite common here: that the Democratic Party is trending more liberal, more coastal, and more in favor of government mandates in climate and land policies.\u201cI\u2019m not saying that there are not things we can do to improve,\u201d Ebersole said. \u201cBut if you talk to a lot of us, we\u2019re already doing things. There\u2019s a huge regenerative movement here in the Americas by choice, not my mandate. I think that is the main thing that matters in politics \u2014 that we get to choose. We\u2019re not being mandated to choose. \u2026 We just want to live in the middle of nowhere and raise cows and feed our neighbors across the country.\u201dEbersole said Trump\u2019s trade policies were better for her business.\u201cIt was much harder to import beef,\u201d she said. \u201cNow most meat that you eat, on the American grocery store shelves, isn\u2019t American beef, and that really concerns me\ufeff.\u201d\u00a0She sees Vice President Kamala Harris as more liberal \u2014 and more likely to favor activist government \u2014 than President\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden.\u201cShe is willing to push her agendas on those of us who live a totally different life,\u201d Ebersole said,\u00a0tying Harris to California\u2019s policies.\u00a0\u201cOur California rancher friends are completely decimated by the policies and the government. Not by their weather conditions, not by any of those things, but by the government policies.\u201dHarris was the California\u00a0attorney\u00a0general from 2011-2017 and has worked in Washington since becoming a senator and now vice president.The conversation is different here than in the swing states. On recent visits toArizonaandPennsylvania, for example, some of our Republican voters who are not Trump fans said they would give Harris a chance to make her case.\u00a0But in\u00a0Iowa, the Republicans in our group were harshly critical of the vice president and more comfortable with coming home to the GOP despite issues they may have\u00a0with Trump and his most vocal MAGA allies.\u201cMost of the people that vote for Trump are just quiet people who want to live our own lives in our own place,\u201d Ebersole said. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to tell those people to quiet down a bit.\u201dIt may seem an odd time to visit Iowa, given its status as a solid red state,\u00a0when considering each candidate\u2019s strategy to win 270 electoral votes. But we wanted to better understand why those who were so critical of Trump at the beginning of the campaign cycle are so comfortable supporting him now.\u00a0We wanted a firsthand look\u00a0at how our Iowa group \u2014 the first one we visited in August 2023\u00a0\u2014 views\u00a0the race now that Harris has replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket and chosen a Midwest governor, Tim Walz of Minnesota, to be her running mate.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to figure out how to deal with her,\u201d Chris Mudd, a businessman\u00a0from Cedar Falls,\u00a0said of Trump, whom he\u00a0ardently supports. \u201cI think he spends too much time bashing and complaining. \u2026 I think he\u2019ll catch his stride.

We\u2019re selling the power to help people save money.\u201dMudd also believes Trump is more tested on the world stage.\u201cI think about what\u2019s happening in the Middle East,\u201d Mudd said. \u201cWho would I want to negotiate that peace? Kamala or Donald Trump? And for me, it\u2019s simple.\u201dMudd believes the media is too soft on Harris, and he echoes Trump and his MAGA media allies in complaining the vice president rarely takes questions from reporters. He also echoes another line coming from Trump, suggesting there is no way Harris can win an honest election.\u201cThere were shenanigans,\u201d Mudd said when asked what he would think if Harris wins the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t think she has a chance to win in a fair fight. \u2026 I just don\u2019t believe it is possible.

JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, falsely claimed Sunday that former President Donald Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t go after his political opponents\u201d during his presidency \u2013 an assertion that is contradicted by a mountain of evidence.Vance, who saidFridaythat the attorney general would be the most important government official other than the president in a second Trump administration, wasaskedby ABC News host Martha Raddatz in an interview on Sunday if Trump would go after his political opponents. Vance said no, thenadded, \u201cMartha, he was president for four years and he didn\u2019t go after his political opponents.\u201dFacts First:Vance\u2019s claim is false. As president, Trump publicly and privately pressured the Justice Department, and others in his administration, to investigate or prosecute numerous political opponents.Trump madeextensive behind-the-scenes effortsto get his political opponents charged with crimes. But you don\u2019t have to rely on investigative reporting or the memoirs of former administration officials to know that Trump went after political opponents as president.He often went after them in public, too.As CNN reporter Marshall Cohen hasnoted, there is a long list of political opponents whom Trump publicly called for the Justice Department and others to investigate or prosecute. The list includes not only 2016 election opponentHillary Clintonand 2020 election opponentJoe Bidenbut alsoBiden\u2019s son Hunter Biden,Democratic former Secretary of State John Kerry,Trump\u2019s former national security advisor turned critic John Bolton,Democratic former President Barack Obama,unspecified Obama administration officials,the anonymous author of a New York Times op-ed by a Trump administration official critical of Trump,MSNBC host and Trump critic Joe Scarborough,former FBI director turned Trump critic James Comey,other former FBI officials,former British spy Christopher Steele(the author of a controversial dossier of allegations against Trump), and various congressional Democrats \u2013 includingformer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,Rep. Adam Schiff of California,Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota,Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, andSen. Mark Warner of Virginia.Asked for comment for this article on Monday, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk accused the media of having a biased \u201cdouble standard\u201d and said \u201cit is indisputable that under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ, the Republican nominee for president was targeted and indicted, while under President Trump, nothing like that ever transpired against either of the Democrats he faced off with in 2016 or 2020.\u201dBut that wasn\u2019t for a lack of Trump trying.Trump repeatedly pressured the Justice Department as president to prosecute both Clinton and Biden, in addition totrying to get foreign countries to investigate Biden. That the Trump-era Justice Department declined to charge Clinton and Biden doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true that Trump didn\u2019t \u201cgo after\u201d them or others. (In fact, Trumpliterally saidin 2017 that he wanted the department to be \u201cgoing after\u201d Clinton.)John Kelly, whom Trump appointed as Secretary of Homeland Security and then White House chief of staff,told The New York Times in 2023of Trump: \u201cHe was always telling me that we need to use the FBI and IRS to go after people \u2013 it was constant and obsessive and is just what he\u2019s claiming is being done to him now.\u201dAnd contrary to Vance\u2019s claim to Raddatz that Harris has herself tried to arrest political opponents, which Van Kirk echoed in her Monday statement to CNN, there is no public evidence that Harris pressured the Justice Department to prosecute Trump or her other opponents. The decision to bring two criminal cases against Trump \u2013 one over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and one over his post-presidency retention of classified documents \u2013 was made by a special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland.Trump made many public calls for investigations and prosecutions of\u00a0political opponentsOn some occasions, Trump\u2019s calls for investigations, arrests or prosecutions of his political opponentssoundedmore like vague gripesthan sincere attempts to prompt official action. On numerous occasions, though, Trump applied explicit, sustained public pressure on the Justice Department in general or his attorney general to pursue his opponents.For example, in 2017 and 2018, Trump frequently harangued then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions in tweets and public remarks to investigate various allegations against Clinton.\u201cAttorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes,\u201d hewrotein one tweet. \u201cSo where is the investigation A.G.,\u201d hewrotein another tweet. \u201cSo many people are asking why isn\u2019t the A.G. or Special Council (sic) looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes,\u201d hewrotein another tweet. Inyet anothertweet, he noted allegations about Clinton, then wrote that \u201cat some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper.\u201dTrump made a directpublic requestin 2019 for Ukraine and China to launch investigations into Joe Biden and Hunter Biden \u2013 after he was already facing criticism forprivately pressuring Ukraine to investigate them. And in 2020, Trumppublicly demandedthat then-Attorney General William Barr indict Joe Biden, Obama and unspecified others over their supposed roles in the investigation into his 2016 campaign\u2019s links to Russia.\u201cUnless Bill Barr indicts these people for crimes, the greatest political crime in the history of our country, then we\u2019re going to get little satisfaction unless I win and we\u2019ll just have to go \u2013 because I won\u2019t forget it. But these people should be indicted. This was the greatest political crime in the history of our country. And that includes Obama and it includes Biden,\u201d Trumpsaid.Trump privately pressured the Justice DepartmentTrump suggested in that Fox News interview that he might have raised the subject of Biden and Obama indictments with Barr, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, he\u2019s got all the information he needs. They want to get more, more, more, they keep getting more. I said, \u2018You don\u2019t need any more. You\u2019ve got more stuff than anybody\u2019s ever had.\u2019\u201dTrump privately pressured the Justice Department and Trump administration officials to go after other political opponents, according to former officials and news reports. And it appears he was sometimes successful, though it\u2019s impossible to definitively prove a direct relationship between his demands and the department\u2019s actions.Sessionstold special counsel Robert Muellerthat Trump pressured him in 2017 to abandon hisrecusalfrom investigations related to the 2016 election in order to prosecute Clinton, according to the Mueller report. Sessions did not do that, but heannounced in March 2018that he had (in November 2017) appointed a federal prosecutor to look into a variety of allegations against Clinton. She wasnever charged.The New York Timesreported this yearthat in April 2018, Trump told aides that if Sessions didn\u2019t prosecute Clinton and Comey, Trump would prosecute them himself \u2013 prompting his White House counsel to write him a memo outlining the limits of the president\u2019s powers.Boltonwrotein a 2020 book that Trump was \u201cobsessed\u201d with having Kerry prosecuted for supposedlybreaking a rarely enforced old lawbyremaining in contactwith Iranian officials after leaving office to try to preserve the nuclear agreement Kerry helped to negotiate. Bolton wrote that \u201cin meeting after meeting in the Oval (Office), Trump would ask Attorney General William Barr or anybody listening to launch a prosecution.\u201dThe same week in 2018 that Trump tweeted that Kerry might have broken the law, the Justice Department assigned federal prosecutors to investigate Kerry,according to a bookby former federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman, who wasousted by Trump in 2020. Then, the same day Trump tweeted about Kerry in 2019, a Justice Department official called one of the prosecutors to apply more pressure over the case, Berman wrote. Kerry was never charged.In 2019, Barr satisfied Trump\u2019s investigate-the-investigators demand bytaskinga federal prosecutor to help investigate the origins of the FBI\u2019s probe related to Russia and the 2016 election. In late 2020, with about three months left in Trump\u2019s presidency, Barr gave that prosecutor, John Durham,the status of special counsel.And in early 2020, Barrtaskeda different federal prosecutor with taking in information from members of the public,notably including then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, related to allegations about the Bidens and Ukraine, which had been a subject of Trump\u2019s public and private focus."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Fact check: What Trump keeps getting wrong about \u2018paper ballots\u2019", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/fact-check-trump-paper-ballots/index.html", "content": "WashingtonCNN\u2014After losing the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump has championed the baseless lie that the results were tainted by widespread fraud.To fix this made-up problem, Trump has proposed a four-part solution: The US should switch exclusively to paper ballots, requireproof of citizenshipto register to vote, require voters to show ID at the polls, and eliminate mail-in voting by holding the entire election in-person on just one day.Policymakers can debate the merits of forcing voters to prove their citizenship and provide ID. And mail-in voting, widely used by both Democrats and Republicans, isn\u2019t going anywhere.But Trump\u2019s comments on \u201cpaper ballots\u201d havepuzzled voting expertsand election officials \u2013 because almost all voters nationwide already use paper ballots.Facts First:Trump\u2019s insistence that the US switch to \u201cpaper ballots\u201d is nonsensical. More than 98% of voters live in jurisdictions that produce fully auditable paper trails, according todata from Verified Voting, which tracks election equipment in every county.Trump brings up his four-part proposal almost every time he speaks about election integrity. He has mentioned the \u201cpaper ballots\u201d claimdozens of timesthis year alone.\u201cWe\u2019re going to fix our elections so that our elections are going to be honorable and honest, and people leave, and they know their vote is counted,\u201d Trump said at anAugust rallyin Potterville, Michigan. \u201cWe are going to have free and fair elections. And ideally, we go to paper ballots, same-day voting, proof of citizenship \u2013 very big \u2013 and voter ID.\u201dIn aninterviewlast month, Trump said one way to \u201csolve this problem\u201d of mass fraud was to \u201cgo to paper ballots.\u201d At arallyin Johnstown, Pennsylvania, he said, \u201cwe want to go to paper ballots.\u201d And hesaid, \u201cwe want paper ballots,\u201d in Montezuma Pass, Arizona.Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group, has spent the past two decades urging counties to move away from paperless voting in favor of in-person polling sites. (Vote-by-mail obviously incorporates a paper trail.) The people who run the group say they have accomplished their goal \u2013 despite claims from Trump and others that the US still needs paper ballots.\u201cIt\u2019s really weird and I don\u2019t understand it,\u201d said Mark Lindeman, the group\u2019s director for policy and strategy. \u201cAlmost everybody votes on paper ballots. Anyone who is convinced that we need paper ballots is very likely voting on paper ballots themselves.\u201dOnly about 1.4% of registered voters live in counties where there\u2019s no paper trail of their ballot if they vote in-person, according to Verified Voting\u2019s data. (If they vote-by-mail, then there is a paper trail.) These holdouts are the entire state of Louisiana and a few Texas counties.For everyone else, there are paper trails that can be checked during a post-election audit or recount.Nearly 70% of registered voters live in counties where voters physically mark their choices on a paper ballot.Another 25% of voters live in counties that use \u201cballot-marking devices,\u201d where voters use a touchscreen or another interface to select their candidates, and then the machine fills out a paper ballot to reflect their selections.The remaining 5% of voters use electronic machines that record votes directly into the computer\u2019s memory. But even most of these machines now create paper trails, too. The holdout counties in Texas and the entire state of Louisiana only store the votes on the computer memory.The share of voters in \u201cpaperless\u201d counties has been steadily shrinking with every election cycle over the past 20 years, according to Verified Voting.Sherry Poland, elections director in Hamilton County, Ohio, which includes Cincinnati, said her county switched to hand-marked paper ballots in 2006, and that the system creates a \u201cbackup\u201d and \u201credundancy\u201d that should inspire confidence in the integrity of the process.\u201cThe trend is coming back now and everyone is realizing the value of having a paper trial,\u201d said Poland, a Republican.After the 2016 election, battleground states like Pennsylvania andGeorgiatransitioned away from paperless machines and now use systems with paper trails. And since 2020, Tennessee and many counties in New Jersey, Texas, and Mississippi made the switch too.False and nonsensical claims about election procedures have had a negative impact on voter perceptions on the integrity of US elections, especially among Republicans.A majority of Trump supporters in Michigan, Arizona, and Pennsylvania now say they\u2019re \u201cnot at all confident\u201d or only \u201cjust a little\u201d confident the results will be accurately tallied in their state, according torecent CNN polling.

Univision itself debunked that claim on Thursday night.Trump also made a false claim that he doesn\u2019t use teleprompters himself. In reality, Trump regularly uses teleprompters for his speeches and, as usual, hadone visible to his left and one visible to his rightduring this very speech.Trumpsaidat the Friday rally in Aurora, Colorado: \u201cDid you see where she did a town hall yesterday and she used a teleprompter?

The moderator of the Univision town hall and the president of Univision News both refuted the claim that Harris used a teleprompter at the town hall, noting Thursday that the teleprompter that was seen on the broadcast had text in Spanish, not English, and that it was material for the moderator, not Harris. And Trump uses teleprompters for most of his speeches, though he also regularly ad-libs additional remarks.The false claim that Harris used a teleprompter at the town hall generated millions of views on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. It was made by several right-wing commentators with significant followings, includingBenny Johnson,Charlie Kirk,Greg Priceand Fox News host Sean Hannity.Univision News president Daniel Coronell, responding to Price\u2019s claim that \u201cKamala is using a teleprompter during her \u2018town hall\u2019 with Univision,\u201dwroteon X: \u201cThat\u2019s not true. The teleprompter that displays a text written in Spanish was a support element for the town hall moderator. I can tell you this with first-hand knowledge because I was in charge of the television program.\u201dTown hall moderator Enrique Acevedo, responding to Johnson\u2019s claim that \u201cUnivision accidentally broadcast proof that Kamala used a teleprompter at her town hall,\u201dwroteon X: \u201cThe prompter displayed my introduction (in Spanish) and then it switched to a timer. Any claim to the contrary is simply untrue.\u201dAcevedo and Coronell both posted their debunkings late Thursday night, but the viral posts from Price, Johnson and Kirk remained online as of 4 p.m. on Friday; Hannity deleted his post. Price, Johnson and Kirk did not respond to CNN requests for comment on Friday.Trump has made teleprompter-related comments a staple of his recent criticism of Harris as he has insulted her intelligence. Last month, hefalsely claimedthat Harris used notes in a televised interview with CNN.The right-wing commentators\u2019 inaccurate posts claiming Harris used a teleprompter at the Univision town hall relied on a 12-second clip that was posted Thursday by the Trump campaign\u2019s \u201cTrump War Room\u201d account.

Ten House races in California and six in New York are currently rated as competitive byInside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales.Republicans in both states are defending several seats that are held by lawmakers who won close contests in 2022 but thatJoe Bidenwould have carried two years earlier under the current lines.In New York, they include the 4th\u00a0Congressional District, held by freshman Rep.Anthony D\u2019Esposito, and a pair of upstate seats also represented by first-term lawmakers, Marc Molinaro (19th\u00a0District) and Mike Lawler (17th\u00a0District).The GOP is also trying to hold on to several competitive seats in California, mostly in territory that backed Biden in 2020. The vulnerable members include a pair of Central Valley congressmen \u2013 Reps. David Valadao of the 22nd\u00a0District and John Duarte of the 13th\u00a0District. Also on the list are Reps. Mike Garcia of the 27th\u00a0District and Michelle Steel of the 45th\u00a0District, both in the Los Angeles area, and Rep. Kevin Calvert, whose 41st\u00a0District in the Inland Empire would have narrowly supportedDonald Trumpfour years ago.Top contestsWith those series of highly competitive contests beckoning, both California and New York have been flooded with ad money from outside groups, while grassroots donors, responding to battleground appeals, have helped the candidates push ad spending totals even higher. California, in particular, saw twice as much House ad spending in the month since the last primaries as any other state.And in the top 20 House contests for ad spending between September 11 and October 10, Democrats combined to outspend Republicans in 17 of them by a net of more than $30 million in total.The three races where Republicans led in ad spending wereNebraska\u2019s 2nd\u00a0District, California\u2019s 22nd\u00a0and Iowa\u2019s 3rd \u2013 all three seats that the party is defending.In a few races \u2013 such as D\u2019Esposito\u2019s seat in New York; Duarte\u2019s seat in California; Pennsylvania\u2019s 7th\u00a0District held by three-term Democratic Rep. Susan Wild; Colorado\u2019s 8th\u00a0District, home to freshman Democrat Yadira Caraveo; and Washington\u2019s 3rd\u00a0District, where Democratic Rep.Marie Gluesenkamp-Perezis seeking a second term \u2013 Democrats established large advertising leads in the first full month following the primaries, ranging from about $3 million to $4 million.Across all House races, a few leading outside groups from both parties accounted for a significant share of the ad spending totals. Congressional Leadership Fund, the top House GOP super PAC, spent nearly $60 million, 16% of the total in the month, while its Democratic counterpart, House Majority PAC, spent about $35.5 million, which was 9% of the ad spending total on House races over the 30-day period.Top advertisers and issuesCollectively, Congressional Leadership Fund and House Majority PAC accounted for more than a quarter of all the ad spending in the first full month since the last primaries, and the content of their TV ads reflects the messaging priorities for both parties.According to AdImpact data, Congressional Leadership Fund spent about $42 million on broadcast TV ads in those 30 days, and 39%\u00a0went to ads that referencedimmigration, the top ranked issue in its advertising; CLF also spent more than a quarter of its total ad budget on spots that referencedcrime, and alsotaxes.On the other side, House Majority PAC spent more than $25\u00a0million on broadcast TV ads over the same period, and abortion rights dominated its TV ads more than any other issues by a wide margin \u2013 about 71%\u00a0of the super PAC\u2019s broadcast TV spend went to ads referencingabortion. HMP also spent nearly 40% of its TV ad budget on spots referencing crime, in many cases warning against thecriminalizationof abortion, while ads aboutcharacteraccounted for about 17% of its spending.In addition, Fairshake, a super PAC funded by cryptocurrency interests, has seized an influential role in the campaign, spending nearly $15 million since the final primaries on ads backing a bipartisan slate of industry-friendly candidates in 17 races. The spots praise the candidates\u2019economic policiesand legislative records onother key issues.Looking aheadCampaigns and outside groups routinely book advertising time far in advance, and those future ad reservations are subject to change as candidates and their allies adjust their bookings and spend more campaign money.With three weeks to go before votes are counted in the 2024 election, though, House races in California and New York were poised to continue dominating the landscape, while Democrats held an overall edge in remaining future ad reservations.Including bookings between\u00a0October 11 and Election Day, all advertisers in House races have combined ad reservations totaling more than $441 million, and Democrats lead Republicans by about $252 million to $183 million.California alone was set to see more than $89\u00a0million worth of advertising for House races over the final three and half weeks, while New York was set for more than $50 million\u00a0\u2013 together, about a third\u00a0of all the ad spending targeting the battle for the House in the crucial final stretch."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "In Colin Allred, Ted Cruz once again facing a well-funded Democratic challenger in reelection fight", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/texas-senate-race-ted-cruz/index.html", "content": "Waxahachie, TexasCNN\u2014On a sunny October afternoon, Republican Sen.

Ted Cruz addresses supporters during a campaign event on October 5 in Keller, Texas.Julio Cortez/APCruz has largely aimed his attacks on Allred regarding three issues: the economy, the US southern border and transgender policies. He\u2019s released multiple TV ads pointing to Allred\u2019s vote against a GOP-led House bill last year that\u00a0would have banned transgender athletes from women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports at federally funded schools. The bill,which passed on a party-line vote, was not taken up by the Senate.On the campaign trail, Cruz makes the topic a prominent part of his stump speech. \u201cWe are living in a world where one of the two major parties right now cannot figure out what is a woman,\u201d he said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t use to be a trick question.\u201dAllred became the first Democrat this election cycle to release an ad responding to the barbs over transgender issues \u2013 a key line of attack by Republicans in the presidential race and other congressional races.\u201cTed Cruz is lying again, but now he\u2019s lying about our children. I\u2019m a dad. I\u2019m also a Christian,\u201d Allred says in a new ad. \u201cAnd my faith has taught me that all kids are God\u2019s kids. So let me be clear: I don\u2019t want boys playing girls sports or any of this ridiculous stuff that Ted Cruz is saying.\u201dCNN has asked Allred\u2019s campaign to clarify his stance more precisely but has not received a response.From left, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Lori Chavez-DeRemerThe Washington Post/Getty ImagesRelated articleTwo House incumbents seek to woo the other party\u2019s voters in Pacific Northwest swing seatsCruz also criticizes Allred for changing his tune on the southern border. While running for Congress in 2018, Allredreferred to the border wall as \u201cracist,\u201dand as recently as two years ago said he didn\u2019t see the border as a \u201ctop-of-mind\u201d issue for a lot of voters in Texas, though he said he wanted to see comprehensive immigration reform.He\u2019s now making the border a focal point in his ads, vowing to fix the issue and attacking Cruz for opposing the bipartisan immigration bill earlier this year. Allred also joined with Republicans this year to condemn the \u201cBiden administration\u2019s open-borders policies\u201d in a GOP-led resolution.On the campaign trail, where the border is a winning issue for Republicans, Cruz has repeatedly called out Allred for standing in front of the same border wall that the representative criticized years ago in one of his TV ads and has questioned Allred\u2019s seriousness about the border.In an interview with CNN, Allred defended his position, acknowledging that he and his party took \u201ctoo long to be responsive to what was a rising tide of migration.\u201d\u201cBut we can also say the response can\u2019t be \u2018Let\u2019s be cruel to people and think that\u2019s gonna help.\u2019 That\u2019s not actual border security,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, Allred is hitting Cruz hard over abortion, arguing the senator is \u201cresponsible\u201d for the overturning of Roe v. Wade by helping put judges and justices in federal courts, leading to the landmark decision by the Supreme Court in 2022.\u201cWith Ted Cruz, we get more government and less freedom, and Texas women pay the price,\u201d the narrator says in one of Allred\u2019s ads.While Cruz has celebrated the Supreme Court ruling as a major victory, he\u2019s remained quiet recently about his stance on Texas\u2019abortion laws, which don\u2019t include exceptions for rape or incest. Asked by CNN why he didn\u2019t mention abortion in his stump speech after a rally in Allen, Cruz argued it\u2019s not a top concern for Texas voters and changed the subject to jobs and the border. In another gaggle with reporters the following day, he said it was an issue for state leaders to decide.\u2018Republicans for Allred\u2019Both candidates tout their bipartisanship, but Allred is leaning heavily into his support from high-profile Republicans such as former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who leads a group called \u201cRepublicans for Allred.\u201dAllred brings up their endorsements often, mentioning their names more frequently than Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019. Asked by CNN about that strategy, Allred said he doesn\u2019t think Texas voters view his race and the presidential race in the same light.Rep. Colin Allred speaks during a campaign event that saw volunteers man phones on October 3, in San Antonio, Texas.Brandon Bell/Getty Images\u201cI do think that there are Texans out there who are actual conservatives and who believe in the rule of law, who believe in the Constitution, who believe we shouldn\u2019t try and overturn elections, who think that, you know, they don\u2019t want to be embarrassed anymore by their senator,\u201d he said.Cruz finds Cheney\u2019s support laughable. \u201cI\u2019ve known Liz Cheney a long time, and she\u2019s completely lost her mind,\u201d he told CNN when asked about her endorsement.Allred\u2019s effort to cement his brand as a moderate is one key difference from O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign in 2018. And while O\u2019Rourke crisscrossed the state with large, energetic rallies, Allred has spent much of the race holding smaller, more intimate events, while spending big \u2013 and early \u2013 on TV ads to boost his name recognition. In these final weeks, Allred is starting to do bigger events, urging people to get out the vote.O\u2019Rourke also refrained from going negative against Cruz, but Allred isn\u2019t holding back punches. Several of his ads show video of Cruz at the airport on his infamous trip to Cancun during the deadly 2021 Texas freeze that left the state in a standstill for days. Cruz called the trip amistake when he returned, but he has since joked about it.At a campaign event last week with the \u201cFunky East Dallas Democrats,\u201d Allred railed against Cruz\u2019s intentions as a serious legislator, poking fun at his thrice-weekly podcast, blaming him in part for the January 6, 2021, insurrection, and knocking him on abortion.But in his closing line, Allred asked the crowd to remember Cruz\u2019s Cancun suitcase as they watch the results come in on Election Day.\u201cImagine Cruz taking that same little roller bag and walking right out of the Capitol,\u201d he said.CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report."}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "House Republicans attempt to avoid 2022 letdown with new tactic on abortion: \u2018We\u2019re both pro-choice\u2019", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/house-republicans-abortion-strategy-elections/index.html", "content": "For more on the House Republican strategy on abortion issues, watch CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics with Manu Raju,\u201d this Sunday at 8 a.m. ET.\ufeffWashingtonCNN\u2014Republicans in the nation\u2019s toughest House districts are making a major pivot on abortion with a surprising result \u2014 they\u2019re starting to sound like Democrats.GOP candidates in suburbs of places like Tucson, Des Moines and Syracuse are going public with vows never to criminalize abortion or support a national ban. Some are going further: Rep.John Duarteof California\u2019s Central Valley, Rep. Tom Kean Jr. in northern New Jersey and GOP candidate Matt Gunderson in the San Diego area have all described themselves as \u201cpro choice\u201d \u2014 with the latter even speaking directly to camera in his first TV ad and borrowing Bill Clinton\u2019s phrase calling for the procedure to be \u201csafe, legal and rare.\u201dIn this fall\u2019s toss-up battle for the House, swing-seat Republicans are carefully rebranding themselves on abortion after largely failing to respond to relentless Democratic attacks that cost the GOP big last cycle. And they\u2019re attempting to neutralize the Democrats\u2019 most potent attack \u2014 all in an effort to turn voters\u2019 attention to the US-Mexico border and other galvanizing issues.\u201cSince we\u2019re both pro-choice, then we have an opportunity to take that conversation, set it aside and have a real serious conversation about solving the border, about inflation, the economy, jobs, crime, education,\u201d Gunderson said in an interview, referring to his opponent, Democratic Rep. Mike Levin.It may be easier said than done.Even as swing-seat Republicans attempt to paint a more nuanced view of the GOP\u2019s stance on abortion, the national party has often muddled that message. In recent days, former first lady Melania Trump disclosed she supports the right to an abortion \u201cfree from any intervention\u201d \u2014 while Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, took the staunchly conservative position of vowing to defund Planned Parenthood.And it all underscores a critical weakness for the GOP fewer than 30 days from the election. The party still struggles to respond to an issue that makes up the vast majority of Democratic attacks this cycle: 80% of spending on TV ads by the House Democrats\u2019 two main groups went to ads focusing on abortion. And it\u2019s been particularly effective against GOP incumbents with well-documented comments on abortion \u2014 like Rep. Zach Nunn of Iowa \u2014 that Democrats have turned into attack ads.\u201cYou can\u2019t hide from it,\u201d said Rep. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican from North Dakota, reflecting on the lessons Republicans learned in the 2022 midterms. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really have a plan for what had happened.\u201dDemocrats say their foes\u2019 efforts to show a softer side on abortion won\u2019t work.\u201cHe\u2019s going to probably say anything he needs to say to try to win and see what sticks,\u201d Levin, a three-term Democrat who cut an ad responding to Gunderson, told CNN.\u201cWe know that if Mike Johnson is empowered, that there are many around here that would try to get a national abortion ban in place,\u201d Levin said, even as his opponent said he\u2019d oppose both a national ban and a bill to codify Roe, saying the issue should be left up to the states.Behind closed doors, Republican leaders have spent months working with battleground candidates, particularly in New York and California, to sell a more moderate message on the issue. The House GOP campaign chief, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, has advised fellow Republicans to clearly articulate their views \u2014 or face globs of Democratic spending to distort their position.And they\u2019ve been far more aggressive in calling out some misleading Democratic ads, which have accused Republican candidates of supporting strict abortion bans or opposing exceptions for abortion even when that candidate is on the record with a more moderate position. In some cases, like in pivotal seats inNorth CarolinaandVirginia, fact-checkers have agreed.Hudson accused Democrats of \u201ccreating a false and distorted impression\u201d of the GOP\u2019s abortion position in the 2022 midterms and attacked Democrats for espousing their own \u201cextreme\u201d views on the issue.\u201cTo fight back, we have encouraged our candidates to be open, direct and empathetic about their position \u2013 and nonpartisan fact-checkers have responded, picking apart a litany of Democratic attack ads for telling blatant lies,\u201d Hudson told CNN.Sarah Chamberlain, who runs the centrist-leaning Republican Mainstreet Partnership, recalled warning a prominent GOP pollster the day of the\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0Supreme Court decision that it would be a huge issue for women voters. He initially told her she was wrong, but phoned her after the midterms to admit his miscalculation. Since then, Chamberlain has used her own polling to help convince key swing-seat House Republicans to shift their approach.\u201cDon\u2019t use the \u2018A word.\u2019 Talk about it as women\u2019s health care,\u201d Chamberlain said. \u201cThe economy, immigration \u2014 there\u2019s tons of things we can win on and should win on. But this issue is still very strong.\u201dDemocrats cry hypocrisyIn some cases, Republicans are trying to walk back \u2014 or completely abandon \u2014 their past anti-abortion rights views.When he first ran for Congress in 2022 for a seat in Washington state, GOP candidate Joe Kenttold a local news station: \u201cI would move to have a national ban on abortion.\u201dThis time, Kentfilmed an adstating: \u201cI oppose any new federal legislation on the issue.\u201dKent\u2019s opponent \u2014 Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez \u2014 called out his shifting position in a recentcandidate debate, accusing him of playing \u201cboth sides of this card\u201d and saying \u201cwhat the pollsters tell him to say.\u201dAnd he\u2019s not the only one whose public position has changed. Nunn, the endangered Republican in Iowa, is fighting for his political survival as Democrats devote a majority of their TV ads to the issue in this suburban battleground.Nunn\u2019s Democratic opponent, Lanon Baccam, hasattacked the GOP incumbentwith a clip from the Republican primary debate in 2022 when Nunn raised his hand to say all abortions should be illegal in the country. Nunn has not responded to the issue of abortion on air.And in the key California race to hold Levin\u2019s seat, the main Democratic super PAC \u2014 House Majority PAC \u2014 has reserved $1.5 million to begin next week in an effort to target Gunderson. Abortion attacks are expected to be part of the mix.Levin has seized on Gunderson\u2019s opposition to a 2022 California abortion rights referendum, which the Republican previously referred to as \u201cdisgusting\u201d in a meeting with voters.\u201cWhat I did say was that late-term abortion is disgusting,\u201d Gunderson told CNN when asked about those remarks, arguing the referendum \u201copened up a Pandora\u2019s box to late-term abortion.\u201dDemocratic leaders say Republicans are trying to muddy the waters.\u201cThis is a desperation move by Republicans,\u201d said House Democrats\u2019 campaign chief, Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state. \u201cPeople know where they stand.\u201dPro-women language but unclear on specificsIn 2022, Democrats dumped a half-billion dollars\u2019 worth of abortion attacks into pivotal races and helped prevent a GOP wave. This time, Republicans, like freshman Rep. Marc Molinaro, who is defending a tough upstate New York seat, are looking to take that issue off the table for Democrats.Molinaro was one of the first Republicans this cycle to launch a TV ad devoted solely to his stance on abortion.\u201cI believe in supporting all women and the choices they make,\u201d Molinaro says, speaking into the camera, in the ad.But even as he has sought to counter Democratic attacks, he hasn\u2019t been entirely clear on what positions he does support. While the New York Republican touted support for \u201cbroad access\u201d to birth control and blocking efforts to ban mifepristone in an interview, he didn\u2019t offer a clear answer when asked if he supports restoring\u00a0Roe\u00a0or if he considers himself \u201cpro choice.\u201d\u201cI describe it as somebody who says that the decision and the choice on reproductive health is between you and your physician. Immaterial of anything else, that\u2019s what I believe,\u201d Molinaro told CNN. As for his decision to speak up on abortion, Molinaro added: \u201cI think it\u2019s important that people see me explain to them that I respect the choice they make and that they have my support.\u201dHe isn\u2019t the only Republican looking to keep their distance from the Dobbs decision.Duarte, the vulnerable California Republican, refused to say if he supports the 2022 decision that struck down Roe.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s done. It\u2019s in the rearview mirror,\u201d Duarte told CNN. \u201cAnd the fact is that abortion is back in the states where it belongs.\u201dAnd the congressman contended that his position \u2014 and Trump\u2019s position \u2014 that the matter should be left up to the states is effectively pro-abortion rights.\u201cI am pro-choice,\u201d Duarte said, arguing that Trump is even \u201cfunctionally pro-choice,\u201d though the former president regularly boasts about appointing three Supreme Court justices who struck down Roe and plans to vote against a Florida abortion rights referendum this fall.Another battleground Republican, Rep. Juan Ciscomani of southern Arizona, went up with his own TV ad this fall saying he opposes a federal abortion ban and supports abortion in the cases of certain exceptions, such as protecting the life of the mother.In adebatethis week, Ciscomani added that he also opposed his state\u2019s Civil War-era ban on nearly all abortions, which was recently repealed. But he didn\u2019t say how he\u2019ll vote this November on his state\u2019s ballot measure to enshrine rights to an abortion up to the point of viability, saying only that it was a state issue.And when asked about what he was trying to sell to voters with his ad, Ciscomani simply said: \u201cMy position.\u201d"}, {"source": "cnn", "title": "Trump spread conspiracies on mail-in voting for years.

According to the state\u2019s board of elections, there are 481,000 registered Republicans in the 25 counties, compared with 293,000 Democrats.Trump campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement that the proposals to expand voting access in North Carolina \u201cwill ensure the people who have already suffered from the storm don\u2019t lose their right to participate in this important election.\u201d\u201cSwift action from the North Carolina General Assembly and the Governor will ensure the people of their state have their voices heard on November 5th,\u201d they said.\u2018Too big to rig\u2019Trump has previouslyreleased videosand messageson his social mediapromoting early and mail-in voting as part of the Republican National Committee\u2019s get-out-the-vote program. Both methods of voting are promoted at Trump\u2019s campaign rallies.But that push has at times led to conflicting messaging from the former president.Last month, at a rally inIndiana, Pennsylvania, Trump disparaged early voting, and promoted it, in the same breath.\u201cWe got to get out and vote. And you can start right away. You know that, right? Now we have this stupid stuff where you can vote 45 days early. I wonder what the hell happens during that 45. \u2018Let\u2019s move, see these votes? We\u2019ve got about a million votes in there. Let\u2019s move them. We\u2019re fixing the air conditioner in the room, right?\u2019 No, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat happened the last time was disgraceful, including right here.

Roy Cooper on Thursday, gave the 25 counties in the federally declared disaster area additional flexibility to run their elections. The law contains provisions similar to several of Trump\u2019s proposals, including giving counties more flexibility on early voting hours and allowing counties to use temporary voting locations if precincts are unusable.Destroyed homes are seen in Chimney Rock, North Carolina, on October 2, 2024, after the passage of Hurricane Helene.Allison Joyce/AFP/Getty Images\u201cI will give the Republicans who are in charge here credit for passing good legislation (Wednesday) that definitely will address needs of voters,\u201d said Bob Phillips, the executive director of Common Cause North Carolina, a group that advocates for expanded voter access. \u201cThe biggest thing is giving each of these county board of elections the flexibility with regards to voting sites, both for early voting and Election Day.\u201dThe Trump campaign also proposed expanding bipartisan teams to help voters request and deliver absentee ballots to county boards and allowing voters displaced to other counties in the state to cast provisional ballots that would be delivered back to their home county.In Georgia, however,where Helene also caused significant damage,\u00a0Republicans\u00a0opposed an attempt to\u00a0expand voter access. The Republican National Committee intervened as a defendant in a lawsuit brought by civil rights groups to extend the county\u2019s voter registration deadline, which was Monday.A federal judge on Thursdaydenied that motion, saying it \u201clacked clarity and detail\u201d as to how specific individuals were harmed.A similar lawsuit over the voter registration deadline in Florida \u2013 which is still determining the damage inflicted byHurricane Milton\u2013 was also dismissed by a federal judge on Wednesday.An RNC spokesperson said liberal groups in Georgia were trying to use the courts to extend registration deadlines enacted by the legislature, when voters have had months to register to vote in Georgia.\u201cAs many Americans are still reeling from the impact of Hurricane Helene, the Trump Campaign and RNC are fighting to expand voting access for those displaced, and we are meeting voters where they are to ensure they are educated on voting changes,\u201d said RNC spokesperson Anna Kelly.Trump and his allies have argued there\u2019s a difference in changes approved by a legislature \u2013 like the campaign asked North Carolina to do \u2013 and many of the changes that were made in 2020 by election boards during the pandemic.Voting rights advocates say while the circumstances are different between a pandemic and a hurricane, the idea of allowing displaced voters to participate in an election should be the same.\u201cEven to the extent these disasters cause different hurdles, the policy solutions are often the same,\u201d said Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center. \u201cExpanded access is key, and in order to expand access, funding is key.

The level isn\u2019t expected to be as high this year, but many states across the country haveexpandedthe availability of mail-in voting.These special measures include designated lines at post offices for people with ballots, extra deliveries and collections by letter-carriers, \u201cafter-hours\u201d drop-offs to election offices, and keeping processing facilities open on the Sunday before Election Day.The postmaster general tiptoed around a question from CNN about Trump\u2019s recent social media post, implicitly rebuking the former president without mentioning his name.\u201cMy response is like my response to everyone who says we\u2019re not prepared for the election \u2013 it is that they\u2019re wrong,\u201d DeJoy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I need to comment any more than that. They\u2019re wrong.\u201d\u201cFor a variety of reasons, there is a heightened sensitivity and scrutiny across the entire vote-by-mail ecosystem,\u201d DeJoy also said. \u201c\u2026The American public will become increasingly alarmed if there is ongoing dialogue that continues to question the reliability of the Postal Service for the upcoming elections.\u201dLyingaboutmail-in votingwas acenterpieceof Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, and as the 2024 race reaches the final stretch, he hasresurrectedmany of thesefalse claims.In a social media post on Sunday, Trump claimed without evidence that USPS \u201cadmitted that it is a poorly run mess.\u201d And Trump claimed in a recent interview with a right-wing radio host that USPS will \u201close hundreds of thousands of ballots, maybe purposely.\u201dDespite Trump\u2019s claims, voter fraud is extremely rare in US elections, according to studies from liberal and conservative groups, and the expansion of mail-in voting doesn\u2019t automatically benefit Democrats over Republicans. But since 2020, Trump\u2019sincessant attackson the practice hasmade it much less popularamong GOP voters.The USPSsaysduring the 2020 election, which was conducted amid the Covid-19 pandemic, it delivered nearly 99% of ballots from voters to election officials within seven days.

But in Santini\u2019s mind, the true nature of the place is the community itself.\u201cIt\u2019s doubled in size since I moved here in the early \u201890s, but it\u2019s still a place where, again, you can walk through a farmer\u2019s market,\u201d Santini said. \u201cYou see people talking and getting along with each other.

The automotive industry was the dominant employer \u2013 and between General Motors and the rings of suppliers and support businesses that surrounded the plant here, the community was deeply attached to the company\u2019s operations.\u201cEighty to ninety percent of the adults in the church were employed full time with GM,\u201d Coleman\u2019s father, a bishop in the Church of God in Christ, says of the congregation he inherited from his own dad.\u201cRight now, in our congregation, I have one person full-time employed by the auto industry,\u201d Hurley Coleman Jr. says.In recent years, other industries have started to move in to provide opportunities that had seemed all too fleeting as the broad-based manufacturing tied to major automakers atrophied in the area.Advanced manufacturing across several industries, including major investments in electric vehicle supply chains, have developed, and major hospitals and medical device companies have expanded their foothold.\u201cThe story that I\u2019d like for us to tell is that we\u2019re resilient and that we do bounce back and that we do have people in this region that are thinking towards the future and that we have, hopefully, a new generation of people that will love this region as well, just like we do,\u201d the younger Coleman says.Coleman was sitting at his kitchen table as he toggled between sparks of optimism \u2013 for his community and his family \u2013 and the weight of what he\u2019s experienced over the past several years.The nonprofit that he leads works with the residents who have the least.\u201cSometimes when they come in there and we are their last hope,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cThe lights are shut off. They have no food in the cabinets. Senior citizens have been sitting at home, nobody to call, nobody to help them out.\u201dThe best days are the smiles Coleman sees when his team provides that lifeline. But the weight of being a last resort in a community grappling with violence and poverty can be overwhelming.\u201cThere are those days when we have so many people that need help. So many problems, so many issues, so many emergencies and calamities that have happened,\u201d Coleman says.Phil KernerCNNA craftsman and a diminishing tradeBack in Erie, as Phil Kerner flips through the binder on his desk filled with sketches, time cards and family history, it\u2019s apparent there isn\u2019t much he hasn\u2019t saved over the years.There\u2019s the copy of the 1920 census that lists his grandfather Edward as a toolmaker in this corner of northwestern Pennsylvania.The story of Edward\u2019s three sons \u2013 two toolmakers and a machinist \u2013 shows how deeply intertwined his family had been with the trade and their community at one time.That\u2019s no longer the case.\u201cMy grandfather did this. My father did this. My uncles did it. My brothers did it. I did it. My kids aren\u2019t doing it,\u201d Kerner says. \u201cThat tells you everything, right?\u201dKerner still loves his tool and die craft and now works for a local family-owned manufacturer of component parts when he\u2019s not in the workshop he built in his basement.His work can be painstakingly intricate, from the granular details necessary in the sketch of a design to the art and science required to build a plastic injection mold.Toys, storage containers, mechanical parts and other items found in homes across the country are likely to contain the type of thing Kerner specializes in crafting.When President George W. Bush famously stood with a bullhorn on the still-smoldering rubble of ground zero after 9/11, the firefighter standing next to him had a respirator mask around his neck. Kerner designed and built the plastic mold for the mask.But Kerner can pinpoint the exact moment he saw his industry take a turn as part of a decadelong shift to cheaper and faster production overseas.\u201cI realized that my best customer for ten years was - I wouldn\u2019t use the word undermining me - but had totally abandoned a lot of us in Erie that were doing work for them,\u201d Kerner recalled.Kerner remains deeply passionate about his profession, so much so that as he saw interest waning in what he viewed as a top-tier trade, he took matters into his own hands.He launched a YouTube channel titled, naturally, \u201cThe Tool and Die Guy.\u201d He has more than 25,000 subscribers.\u201cI\u2019m just what they\u2019re looking for - irreverent enough, you know?\u201d Kerner said with a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m the toolmaker they always wish they had working next to them.\u201dThe videos \u2013 now more than 170, including one recapping his sitdown with CNN \u2013 was the furthest thing from a vanity project in search of social media fame.Instead, it was an effort born of that passion for his trade \u2013 and his deep concern that the appreciation for the skill and craftsmanship that goes with it has diminished in the same way that manufacturing has in places like Erie across the country.The impact, he notes, cuts far deeper than a plant and its employees. The entire community takes the hit.\u201cIt\u2019s sad to see it as somebody who has experienced the zenith of manufacturing from the 50s up until the 90s,\u201d Kerner says.A street in Erie, PensylvaniaCNN\u2018Probably going to call Trump\u2019Kerner cops to being \u201ca little bit of a political junkie,\u201d and he pays close attention to the broader economic news in the country.\u201cI always tell people I\u2019m not a Republican, I\u2019m a realist. I think they\u2019re all terrible,\u201d he says.He knows the broader macroeconomic numbers point to an economy that has exceeded expectations and forecasts for several years running. But his view of the economy is tied to what he\u2019s seeing in his household.\u201cIt\u2019s not like my wages are going up,\u201d Kerner says. \u201cNot a complaint, but my wages aren\u2019t going up. And I get it - I see that touted a lot. Wages going up. Wages going up. I talk to my friends, \u2018Your wages going up?\u2019 No. I don\u2019t know whose wages are going up.\u201dHe describes his decision for who to vote for in similar terms \u2013 comparing it to a business owner forced to choose between making payroll or paying suppliers.\u201cIf you don\u2019t figure this out, you lose your home. We\u2019re going to foreclose on you. Who are you going to call?\u201d Kerner asks. \u201cProbably going to call Trump.\u201dHe estimates about 95% of the people he works with also support Trump.\u201cI think the general consensus in the business community is Trump\u2019s kind of one of us or one of them, you know, because he\u2019s at least on it,\u201d Kerner says. \u201cYou ain\u2019t like the way he did it, but that\u2019s his background.\u201dWhat he\u2019d really like to see, he makes clear repeatedly, is something that flies far beneath the current political radar. Elevated and uniform apprenticeship standards that take into account the importance of the trade \u2013 and the value that comes with it, which should ensure lifelong employment in manufacturing.It is, in many ways, the point of his YouTube videos, which have taken on a deeper meaning for him over time.\u201cAs long as there\u2019s an internet, people will know that there was a Kerner family in Erie, Pennsylvania.

He hears often about the border and whether migrants are taking federal aid that could help people in his community.The pandemic-era stimulus checks, which Trump made a point of putting his name on, also come up regularly.\u201cThere are people who think that the stimulus checks that came out during the pandemic and things of that nature are something that\u2019s going to happen again,\u201d Coleman\u2019s father says.Still, Biden\u2019s decision to drop out of the race and Harris\u2019 rise has sparked a new level of enthusiasm, according to the elder Coleman.\u201cNow the conversation is not how bad Biden was or how good Trump was, but what possibly could happen with a Harris presidency,\u201d the bishop says. \u201cI think there\u2019s more opportunistic hope that\u2019s been created in the last few weeks.\u201dDriving down Williams Street with the younger Coleman, just before the Saginaw River, it\u2019s impossible to miss the string of abandoned silos that jut into the skyline.Once an unavoidable blot hanging over the city\u2019s business and arts districts, they were transformed a few years ago into a 70,000-square-foot canvas for contract street artists.For Coleman, the eruption of bright colors and unwieldy shapes represents more than just a beautification project.\u201cWhat was old, what was outdated is about its experience of having transformation and rebirth,\u201d he says, staring at the mural. \u201cAnd people are going to benefit off of others\u2019 creativity and desire to see change.

Santiago/Getty Images/FileRelated articleWhat to know about early voting in Georgia and North CarolinaParts of the state are continuing to recover from Hurricane Helene, which hit the US last month and wreaked havoc on several other states in the Southeast. Georgia election officials say absentee ballots went out by the US Postal Service as scheduled and were not impacted by the storm.\u201cSo far, we have seen just over 250,000 voters request absentee ballots. Perhaps in the next week or so, we\u2019ll see that rise up to 300,000  \u2013 and that we think will probably look like around 5-6% of all voters will be voting absentee this cycle,\u201d Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said on Tuesday.Experts say that some new state laws that tightened rules for absentee ballots and cracked down on the availability of drop boxes may make the option less appealing than early in-person voting.While many drop boxes were available 24/7 in 2020, this year there will be fewer of them, and they will be in election offices or early vote locations with hours that tend to mimic normal business hours.It\u2019s also possible that the state could continue to see high numbers of early votes given that Georgia law now mandates two Saturdays of early voting and allows for two Sundays of early voting if a county desires.Raffensperger said Tuesday that safeguards are in place for a safe election and that in addition to every race being audited, officials will also randomly audit voting equipment to inspect.\u201cPulling out a piece of equipment, a random audit on Election Day, bring it to headquarters and then verify that it is recording the votes accurately, that it has not been hacked by any bad actors out there,\u201d Raffensperger told reporters.Raffensperger, who was in Trump\u2019s crosshairs following the 2020 election,re-certified the resultsafter a statewide machine recount in December 2020 that confirmed that Biden beat Trump by just 11,779 votes out of nearly 5 million ballots cast in the Peach State.Legal fights continueMeanwhile, state judges are scrutinizing a number of new rules passed by the Trump-backed Republican majority on the State Election Board that Democrats warn could inject post-election \u201cchaos\u201d into the Georgia.During a marathon court hearing Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney suggested that a rule requiring ballots case on Election Day be hand-counted by poll workers might have been passed too \u201clate in the game\u201d to remain in effect for this cycle.

HUGE!\u201d Gabriel Sterling with Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State office posted on social media.Here\u2019s what to know about how voting and elections will work in two key swing states.GeorgiaFewer drop boxes but more ways to vote earlyNew state laws after 2020 that tightened rules for absentee ballots and cracked down on the availability of drop boxes may make the option less appealing than early in-person voting, election experts said.While many drop boxes were available 24/7 in 2020, this year there will be fewer of them, and they will be in election offices or early vote locations with hours that tend to mimic normal business hours.In this November 2022 photo, people wait in line for early voting for the midterm elections at Ponce De Leon Library in Atlanta.Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images/FileRelated articleGeorgia judge says county election officials cannot delay or decline certification of election results\u201cThe drop boxes have really been made so inconvenient to use that fewer voters are able to utilize them,\u201d said Kristin Nabers, the Georgia state director for All Voting is Local. \u201cI don\u2019t want to discourage people from using drop boxes by any means, but I can see why people would think it\u2019s easier to show up in person.\u201dMeanwhile, the opportunities to vote early in-person have expanded: Georgia law mandates two Saturdays of early voting and allows for two Sundays of early voting if a county desires.Limits on feeding people in lineA 2021 law that makes it a crime to offer food or drinks to voters waiting to cast a ballot \u2013 which was highly publicized by news outlets and immortalized by comedian Larry David in episodes of \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d \u2013 mostly survived legal challenges. So, offering a bottle of water or a snack to voters within 150 feet of a building where ballots are being cast is still banned.The law also sought to ban offers of food or beverages within 25 feet of a voter standing in line, even if it was well beyond 150 feet of the building where ballots were being cast. A judge paused that provision, allowing voting rights groups to offer so-called line relief to voters that may find themselves waiting in particularly long lines.Hoping to speed up results but worries about uncertaintyThe Peach State made several changes to try to get voters faster election results. At 8 p.m. ET on election night, counties are required to report results from their early in-person and absentee ballots. As counties tabulate the Election Day vote, they\u2019ll provide updates at regular intervals. The goal, according to Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, is to provide speedy, fair and transparent results.A polling station is pictured during the primary elections in Atlanta in May 2022.DUSTIN CHAMBERS/ReutersRelated articleGeorgia group that pushes election misinformation gains influence with election officialsAt the same time,several new rulespassed by a Donald Trump-backed Republican majority on the Georgia State Election Board are creating uncertainty around the post-election process. The board passed a rule requiring a hand count of the number of ballots at each voting location, which could potentially delay the reporting of results.The board also passed rules allowing county officials to examine extensive election materials prior to certifying and requiring those officials to conduct a \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d before they certify results.There are ongoing lawsuits related to all the new rules, which Democrats and voting rights activists worry could be exploited by county-level officials who want to try to challenge election results or delay the certification process.North CarolinaImpact of Hurricane Helene damageOfficials in North Carolina have been scrambling in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene to ensure residents are still able to cast a ballot.\u201cI think there will be a drop off, it\u2019s hard to really predict how much,\u201d Bob Phillips, executive director of Common Cause North Carolina said of the storm\u2019s impact on turnout. \u201cBut I\u2019m encouraged so far by the response the State Board of Elections has done to educate folks on what to do and how to vote.\u201dFILE PHOTO: A resident enters a FEMA's improvised station to attend claims by local residents affected by floods following the passing of Hurricane Helene, in Marion, North Carolina, U.S., October 5, 2024.

Acceptable forms of ID include a driver\u2019s license, passport and student photo IDs that have been approved by the state election board.There are exceptions if a voter is unable to provide identification and one of those exceptions is a natural disaster. In that case, voters fill out an ID exception form that accompanies their ballot. The state election board notes that county election boards are required to count provisional ballots that include ID exception forms.Ballot selfiesBoth Georgia and North Carolina prohibit photographing ballots.\u201cIn this day and age, everyone\u2019s taking selfies, even people in the boomer generation like me,\u201d Phillips from Common Cause North Carolina said. \u201cBut there definitely is a law that says no selfies.\u201dPhillips noted that voters are still able to take their phones into a polling place if they want to look up information about who they\u2019re voting for.

In that conversation, Netanyahu relayed to Biden his plan to hit military targets, the person said.The Washington Postfirst reported that Netanyahu had reassured Biden of his plans to avoid nuclear and oil targets.Responding to that report, Netanyahu\u2019s office said it will consider US opinions but ultimately decide itsresponse to Iran\u2019s October 1 attackbased on its own national interests.

And hitting Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities could trigger the full-blown regional war that Biden has desperately sought to avoid.American officials have said they expected a measured response from Israel, believing the country did not want an out-of-control conflict with Iran.

Those seats \u2013 five held by Democrats and 16 by Republicans \u2013 will likely determine which party controls the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority.\u00a0Two of those seats are here in the Pacific Northwest: South of Gluesenkamp Perez\u2019s district, another freshman congresswoman, RepublicanLori Chavez-DeRemer, is seeking reelection in a seat that backedJoe Bidenby 8 points in 2020.Such seats \u2013 where bipartisanship is a necessity, not a choice \u2013 have become increasingly rare. Twenty years ago, there were nearly 60 crossover districts,according to an analysisby the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. In these districts, incumbents usually assert their independence from their national parties and tout their work across the aisle, as their opponents seek to nationalize the contests and urge party allegiance.And as partisanship has increased, it\u2019s become harder for these candidates to navigate the demands of\u00a0both aNovember electorate that rewards bipartisanship and\u00a0base voters\u00a0who punish party disloyalty\u00a0in primaries.For Gluesenkamp Perez, finding that balance has involved joining a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Washington, DC, for daily CrossFit workouts to find legislative partners. It\u2019s also meant voting against the Biden administration on key issues such as student debt cancellation, a vote that prompted outraged progressives from across the country to flood the Yelp\u00a0and Google pages\u00a0of her family\u2019s auto repair shop with negative reviews.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not productive to think about it as I\u2019m asking people to make a political choice,\u201d Gluesenkamp Perez said in an interview between campaign events. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to bring back power and respect to people in the trades and people in my community.\u201dPrimary defeatsOver the past two years, voters in this region have felt the consequences of ousting centrist House incumbents.Gluesenkamp Perez\u2019s predecessor, Jaime Herrera Beutler, was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after January 6, 2021. But in 2022, after representing the district for more than a decade, she lost a top-two open primary, finishing behind Gluesenkamp Perez and Kent, a retired Green Beret who had Trump\u2019s endorsement. The Democrat went on to win the general election by 2,600 votes.A few miles south, a similar story played out in Oregon\u2019s 5th District, where longtime\u00a0Democratic\u00a0Rep. Kurt Schrader, a member of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition, lost his primary to progressive Jamie McLeod-Skinner. Schrader had Biden\u2019s endorsement but had angered the left by voting against Democratic priorities such as Covid-19 relief funding and allowing Medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs, which he opposed in a committee hearing prior to backing a narrower Medicare negotiation plan on the House floor.McLeod-Skinner lost the general election to Chavez-DeRemer, the former mayor of Happy Valley, by 2 points in a district that stretches south from the Portland suburbs to Bend.Like Gluesenkamp Perez, Chavez-DeRemer has touted her efforts in Congress\u00a0to work with the party that dominates her district. The pair, who often share the same flights between Portland and DC, touted their work together on the House Agriculture Committee\u2019s Forestry panel and inadvocating border security funding and defense-only aidto Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.Chavez-DeRemer has sought to localize her race against Democratic state Rep. Janelle Bynum despite the national implications.\u201cSure, it does make sense that people want to put you in a box of red or blue,\u201d Chavez-DeRemer said of her experience running in a Democratic-leaning district. \u201cBut really, it\u2019s\u00a0just sticking to what you\u2019ve been doing, that people trust you, and then they\u2019ll vote for who they believe is going to best represent the district as a whole.\u201dEager to avoid a 2022 general election rematch, Democrats waded into this year\u2019s primary to back Bynum over McLeod-Skinner. Bynum previously defeated Chavez-DeRemer twice in state legislative elections\u00a0around\u00a0Clackamas, a Portland suburb.Former President Barack Obama speaks at a campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris at the University of Pittsburgh on October 10, 2024.Jeff Swensen/Getty ImagesRelated articleObama\u2019s reemergence on the campaign trail for Harris comes as he recognizes his own legacy is at stake\u201cI think Democrats did realize that, \u2018Whoops, Kurt Schrader wasn\u2019t exactly the far-left guy we love with the Green New Deal and all that sort of thing,\u2019 but they realized that they\u2019d gone a little too far,\u201d Schrader said. \u201cI think Janelle is still very progressive, but a little bit less so.\u201dDemocrats say they\u2019re optimistic about their new candidate and believe they have more experience with the new congressional map, which changed last cycle after Oregon gained a sixth seat following the 2020 census. They are also leaning into the national implications of the race.As part of a tour through battleground districts, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries recently held a news conference with Bynum in her Clackamas campaign office. The two were flanked by dozens of supporters, including several union members, an effort to counter Chavez-DeRemer\u2019s endorsements from organized labor.Bynum spoke of her own record in Salem, where she led bipartisan legislation to fund the state\u2019s semiconductor industry and backed Oregon\u2019s abortion protections, which were enacted in 2017 after Trump became president. She argued that Chavez-DeRemer had \u201csided with the most extreme members of her party,\u201d blasted her record on abortion and criticized her decision to endorse Trump.\u201cShe\u2019s stood by Donald Trump at every turn,\u201d Bynum said. \u201cShe\u2019s standing by her man even after he was convicted of 34 felony counts.\u201dJeffries said Bynum would be a vote for passing federal abortion protections and\u00a0advancing\u00a0what Vice President Kamala Harris has described as an \u201copportunity economy.\u201d He also touted Bynum\u2019s two previous victories against Chavez-DeRemer.\u201cWe\u2019re going for the trifecta, going for the triple crown, and we\u2019re going for the three-peat,\u201d he said.Abortion and crimeBoth parties recognize the significance of the two seats, which could play a role in tipping the balance of power in the House, where Democrats need a net gain of four seats to earn control. In both races, Democrats have leaned into abortion rights and Republicans have focused on crime.\u201cThe Pacific Northwest is key to a House Democratic majority,\u201d Dan Gottlieb, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a statement. \u201cAs different as these districts are, the through lines are clear: Lori Chavez-DeRemer and Joe Kent are content to stoke on the chaos and dysfunction we see in Congress and let politicians dictate women\u2019s health care decisions.\u201dBen Petersen, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, tied the two Democrats to the fallout from Oregon\u2019s decriminalization of hard drugs.From left, John Duarte, Tom Kean Jr. and Matt Gunderson.CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images/Matt Gunderson for CongressRelated articleHouse Republicans attempt to avoid 2022 letdown with new tactic on abortion: \u2018We\u2019re both pro-choice\u2019\u201cRepublicans are full speed ahead to grow our majority because voters in both districts reject Democrats\u2019 extreme agenda fueling Portland\u2019s crime, fentanyl and homelessness crisis,\u201d Petersen said.In Oregon, Democrats have pointed to Chavez-DeRemer\u2019s shifting stances on abortion. Shesupported the overturning of Roe v. Wadeand said during her 2022 Republican primary thatshe would \u201cbe in favor of passing\u201dlegislation that would ban the procedure after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is around six weeks.\u00a0In Congress, she opposed legislation that would have blocked federal subsidies to insurance plans that cover abortions,\u00a0but she also voted against a defense bill amendment to reimburse service members who need to travel out of state to receive abortions or other reproductive care.Chavez-DeRemer has said that she would support the will of Oregon voters, who overwhelmingly support abortion rights, and that she is opposed to a national abortion ban. She said she opposed the defense bill amendment because she wanted to use that legislation to focus on national security and argued it wouldn\u2019t affect Oregonians\u2019 rights, in part because the state has a fund to help pay for people\u2019s travel expenses.\u201cI am not pro-choice enough for the choice groups. I\u2019m not pro-life enough for the life groups, because I\u2019m where most Americans are, which is down the middle,\u201d Chavez-DeRemer said in an interview.Republicans, in turn, have pointed to Bynum\u2019s record in the state legislature, as well as her past support for a 2020 ballot initiative that decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs and sought to expand funding for addiction treatment.\u201cNot only was it a failed experiment, but people are dead because of it in Oregon,\u201d Chavez-DeRemer said. \u201cThat accountability cannot just go away \u2013 you don\u2019t get to just say, \u2018I think this is not working out.\u2019\u201dIn 2020, Bynum backed the citizen-led initiative Measure 110 with reservations, noting that it would have looked different if it had originated with the legislature. Though the initiative passed with more than 58% of the vote, Bynum and other lawmakers voted torecriminalize drugsthis year as the state saw a rise in fentanyl use and a delay in the treatment protocols.\u201cThere were a lot of people in my caucus who wanted to continue to work through the status quo and say, \u2018Well, we haven\u2019t given it enough time,\u2019\u201d Bynum\u00a0said in an interview. \u201cAnd there were those of us who were like, \u2018My kids can\u2019t even ride the public bus because people are tweaking out.\u2019 \u2026 That wasn\u2019t what we signed up for.\u201dShe has also defended her record on public safety, pointing to bipartisan police accountability reforms she led in 2021.Other criticisms have scrutinized Bynum\u2019s record on handling sexual harassment allegations. One Congressional Leadership Fund ad pointed to a campaign contribution she made to a colleague in the legislature who was under investigation for sexual harassment.In recent days Republicans have also latched onto a complaint that alleged Bynum didn\u2019t report allegations of misconduct made in 2019 against a campaign operative assigned to her 2022 campaign by Oregon House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm.Bynum is not under investigation. She has said that she did report the misconduct to the accused person\u2019s employer.\u00a0A spokesperson for the Bynum campaign called the allegation that she did not report harassment an attempt to \u201csmear\u201d the candidate that was \u201cnot based in reality.\u201d\u201cMAGA Republicans are lying to Oregon voters about Janelle Bynum\u2019s record because they know their candidate has no record to stand on here in Oregon,\u201d the spokesperson wrote.A nationalized raceWhile Gluesenkamp Perez has sought to distance herself from national Democrats \u2013 she has declined to endorse Harris or say who she will vote for in November \u2013 Kent has campaigned as a Trump ally.He\u2019s also sought to\u00a0move away\u00a0from\u00a0some of the policy positions and controversies that alienated moderates in his first run \u2013 whenhe called for a national abortion banthat would overturn protections in states such as Washington,spoke at a right-wing rally in DCaimed at supporting insurrectionists charged in the deadly January 6 riot, and\u00a0frequently had to disavow or distance himselffrom White nationalists and Nazi sympathizers.Earlier this year, Kent laid out three things his campaign would do differently: stop discouraging Election Day voting, focus more on local issues and reach out to a broader base of Republicans. He has leaned into his personal story, including his status as a Gold Star husband after his wife was killed in 2019 by a suicide bomber in Syria, and hastried to mend fences with moderate Republicans. On abortion, he now says he doesn\u2019t support new federal legislation on the issue but instead wants to promote pro-family policies, such as making diapers tax exempt.The contrast between the two candidates\u2019 approaches was clear at a recent debate with Gluesenkamp Perez. At one point during the debate, both candidates had the opportunity to ask each other a question.In response to Kent\u2019s question on why she voted against House Republicans\u2019 legislation to ban transgender girls from playing on girls\u2019 sports team, Gluesenkamp Perez said she took a \u201clibertarian\u201d approach to the issue and worried it would have subjected young girls to genital examinations.She then asked Kent why he called her legislation to block a rule that would have made table saws more expensive a waste of time.\u201cWhile our southern border is wide open, while the price at the pump and the grocery store is really hurting working Americans, Congress is doing these little performative measures,\u201d Kent said. \u201cWe need to do these big lifts to get the federal government bureaucracy out of our daily lives, in terms of our business and our natural resources industries, secure our border, stop the out-of-control spending \u2013 then we\u2019ll talk about table saws.\u201dEric Burleson, a 45-year-old saw mill worker, said Kent did a better job at debating, but he preferred the points Gluesenkamp Perez made.\u201cIt seems like he was focusing more on the country, what he could do for the country, and she was focused on what she could do for our area itself,\u201d he said.Former Manchester, New Hampshire, Mayor Joyce Craig, left, and former New Hampshire Sen.

Burleson said he\u2019s unsure of how he\u2019ll vote in the presidential election, but he\u2019s leaning toward Glusenkamp Perez at the congressional level.\u201cI don\u2019t really choose between straight party lines. I kind of go with whoever I think has the best ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a Democrat for one office and a Republican for another one, whoever has the best ideas, in my opinion, is probably who I\u2019d vote for.\u201dIn a brief interview following a town hall in Vancouver, Washington, Kent argued that his top priorities are local ones.\u201cI think the biggest issues right now, especially for Congress, it\u2019s the out-of-control inflation, which is handled in DC, but it\u2019s a very local issue,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd same thing with the border. That seems like a very big national issue, but if you look at what fentanyl has done to the community here, it\u2019s pretty local issue as well.\u201dAt the Vancouver gathering, Kent and his supporters leaned into\u00a0those national topics.
