To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.CNN\u2014The race to Election Day in November is in high gear.Voters are casting ballots either by mail or in early voting. The October 1vice presidential debatebetween Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrat, and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican, was likely the last meeting between the Democratic campaign led by Vice President Kamala Harris and the Republican campaign led by former President Donald Trump.While the scene is set for what pollsters expect could be an extremely close election,there will be unexpected developments between now and Election Day on November 5.Nobody expected President Joe Biden\u2019scampaign to implodeafter theshock of his performance at CNN\u2019s debate in late June. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Harris as his replacement.Nobody expected anassassination attempt against Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience.So we don\u2019t know\u00a0specifically\u00a0what will happen between now andElection Day, or what could come after, when the country\u2019s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect:Voting is well underwayCNNRelated articleYour personalized voter handbook for the presidential electionWhile Election Day isn\u2019t until November 5, most states allow some kind of early voting, either by mail or in person, and that process kicks into overdrive in October.Most Americans, nearly 70%, voted early or by mail in 2020, according tocensus figures, although that figure was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.The campaigns will be focused on getting out the vote in the few key battleground states they think are up for grabs. In 2020, Biden won five states that Trump won in 2016. Those states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 could again be the focus in 2024 when Harris, who turns 60 in October, takes on Trump.It\u2019s important to be sure you\u2019re registered to vote as soon as possible, which can usually be done online. Twenty-three states and Washington, DC, allow Election Day voter registration.Election Day and beyondUS law requires federal elections to take place on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that\u2019s November 5.People who don\u2019t vote early will hit their local voting location. Polls will close at different times around the country. Due to the rise of voting by mail, if key states are close, like they were in 2020, we probably won\u2019t know the winner on Election Day.Regardless, expect lawsuits in certain states and the potential for recounts in others. Election Day is far from the end of the election.Separately,Trump\u2019s sentencingon 34 counts of falsifying business records is now scheduled for November 26.Also this month: Biden turns 82.December: Electoral votes are castAfter questions about the election are settled, states confirm, or ascertain, their statewide results. Electors gather in their respective state capitols to cast electoral votes for their statewide winner.Nebraska and Maine also allocate some electoral votes by congressional district, and these could be pivotal in a close race.January: Someone will solemnly swearThe new Congress takes the oath of office on January 3. It\u2019s this new Congress that, in the unlikely event ofan Electoral College tie, would settle the election. Each state would get one vote for president in the House of Representatives.In any event, lawmakers gather on January 6, as everyone should remember from 2020, to count electoral votes. Harris will preside. She could either be thefifth vice president in historyto oversee her own Electoral College victory, or the fourth in history to oversee her own Electoral College defeat.On January 20, 2025, the next president takes the oath of office.This story has been updated with additional developments."}, {"title": "Experience the iconic Magic Wall", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/magic-wall/", "content": ""}, {"title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/politics/senate-race-rankings-october-2024/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014With just over a month until Election Day, the same competitive races continue to dominate the Senate landscape, but there are a few significant changes to the order of CNN\u2019s ranking of the seats most likely to flip.And in the final weeks, the degree to which these 10 races \u2013 which are mostly playing out in statesDonald Trumpeither won or narrowly lost in 2020 \u2013 move in the same direction as the presidential contest will likely determine which party wins control of the Senate.Republican Senate candidate for Montana Tim Sheehy walks up to the stage during a rally for Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump at the Brick Breeden Fieldhouse at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana, on August 9, 2024.Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images/FileRelated articleHow the Senate GOP\u2019s potential majority maker is staying \u2018shielded\u2019 in push to oust Tester in MontanaRepublicans \u2013 who are virtually a lock to pick up the West Virginia seat and would need to either win the White House or pick up one more seat for the majority \u2013 have an incentive to nationalize many of their targeted races. Well-funded Democratic incumbents, for the most part, are touting statewide and local accomplishments and their support for abortion rights.Two states that are part of the Democratic \u201cblue wall\u201d \u2013 and also key White House battlegrounds \u2013 move up on this month\u2019s rankings, which are based on reporting, as well as fundraising, polling and advertising data. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are now in the middle of the pack of flippable seats, along with Michigan, which remains at No. 4.The oddity of this year\u2019s fight for the Senate is that Democrats have consistently led in the public polling of key races, but it\u2019s Republicans who are poised to gain seats and, potentially, control of the chamber.That\u2019s a reflection of the Senate map \u2013 but also increasingly some post-Labor Day tightening as GOP spending picks up and voters get to know their candidates. Still, no public general election polling that meets CNN standards has shown the Republican nominee ahead in any of the seats that Democrats are defending, save for West Virginia.And two GOP targets \u2013 Arizona and Nevada \u2013 are moving down the list because Republicans have not kept the races as competitive as elsewhere.Earlier this year, those two states were Nos. 4 and 5. Now, they\u2019re at 7 and 8.Florida Sen. Rick Scott, left, and Texas Sen. Ted CruzGetty ImagesRelated articleSenate Democrats launch first multimillion-dollar TV investments\u00a0in Texas and Florida as map grows more dauntingAt the same time, Democrats are trying to expand the map in hopes of mitigating potential losses. As CNNfirst reportedlast week, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is making multimillion-dollar TV investments in Texas and Florida. DSCC Chairman Gary Peters has insisted that this is extra spending that won\u2019t take money away from their defensive priorities. Texas remains at No. 9 on CNN\u2019s ranking, while Florida fell off the list earlier this year in favor of the race in deep-blue Maryland.Nebraska is a new state generating political buzz, but it hasn\u2019t earned a place on the ranking. Still, independent Dan Osborn\u2019s challenge to GOP Sen. Deb Fischer has prompted the National Republican Senatorial Committee to start spending here, and elections analysts have moved the race out of the solid Republican category.There remain lots of unknowns in Nebraska, but we\u2019ll be watching to see how that race \u2013 and the 10 others \u2013 develop over the next month.1. West VirginiaSen. Joe ManchinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/FileWest Virginia is essentially out of reach for Democrats, who had little chance of holding this seat without Sen. Joe Manchin running for reelection. Manchin, now an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is likely to be succeeded by Republican Jim Justice, the state\u2019s two-term governor.Justice has had his share of negative headlines, but in a state poised to back Trump by a significant margin, it\u2019s hard to see a world in which Republicans don\u2019t pick up this open seat.2. MontanaSen. Jon TesterAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileDemocrat Jon Tester, who\u2019s running for a fourth term in a state Trump has twice carried by double digits, remains the most vulnerable Senate incumbent this year. Republicans feel confident their nominee,Tim Sheehy, has an edge \u2013 and both Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales and the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter have shifted their rating of the once toss-up race toward the GOP.Democrats still see a path to victory for Tester, who has a proven history of defying the partisan lean of his state by communicating both what he\u2019s done for Montanans and painting a contrast with his opponents.Democrats are trying that playbook against Sheehy, trying to define the wealthy businessman and retired Navy SEAL, who moved to Montana in 2014, as an out-of-state carpetbagger who cannot be trusted. Recentlyunearthed audio recordingsof Sheehy using racist stereotypes to refer to Native Americans has played into that message, with Democrats arguing that he\u2019s alienating a crucial demographic in the state. In a debate earlier this week, Sheehy acknowledged his comments were \u201cinsensitive,\u201d saying, \u201cI come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color sometimes.\u201dTester\u2019s campaign is now leaning into abortion rights on the airwaves \u2013 an issue that\u2019s on the ballot in Montana this year. Arecent adfeatures a self-described \u201clife-long\u201d Republican woman arguing that Sheehy \u201cwants to take away personal freedoms.\u201dBut Republicans are invoking transgender issues in an attempt to cast Tester as a liberal who\u2019s been changed by his years in Washington, while Sheehy istrying to tie Tester to KamalaHarris\u2013 especially on immigration. Tester \u2013 who has not endorsed in the presidential race \u2013 tried to meet those attacks during their debate by pointing out that Sheehy would not have supported this year\u2019s bipartisan border bill that Republicans blocked.3. OhioSen. Sherrod BrownBonnie Cash/Getty Images/FileDemocratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing his toughest reelection in a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 points. Public polling still shows the three-term senator ahead of GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, although that is expected to tighten as more Republican voters come home to Moreno. Brown was at 47% to Moreno\u2019s 43% in a late SeptemberNew York Times/Siena College pollamong likely Ohio voters \u2013 not far outside the margin of error. But the reassuring news for Democrats: Brown was winning 10% of Trump voters.Democrats have seized on Moreno\u2019s recent comments at a town hall suggesting that some suburban women were single-issue voters when it comes to abortion and questioning why women over 50 would care about the topic. Brown pointed to the remarks as evidence that his opponent is out of step with the 57% of Ohio voters who last year approved a ballot measure protecting reproductive rights. WinSenate, a Democratic outside group, also launcheda new adwith a woman talking about the emergency abortion she underwent at 25 for an ectopic pregnancy, saying, \u201cOur lives don\u2019t belong in Bernie Moreno\u2019s hands.\u201d(Moreno\u2019s campaign said in a statement that he was \u201cclearly making a tongue-in-cheek joke about how Sherrod Brown and members of the leftwing media like to pretend that the only issue that matters to women voters is abortion,\u201d and that Moreno believes women \u201ccare just as much about the economy, rising prices, crime and our open southern border as male voters do.\u201d)The Senate contest in Ohio ranked as the most expensive congressional race on record, as of October 3, with total ad spending from both parties this cycle, including future reservations, exceeding $446 million, according to AdImpact. Brown \u2013 who announced raising $30.6 million in the third quarter \u2013 has continued totouthis work to pass the PACT Act to help veterans exposed to burn pits, while Morenotries to nationalizethe race by tying Brown to Harris and inflation and linking himself to Trump. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to GOP leadership, isattackingBrown over transgender issues to try to cast him as out-of-step with the partisanship of the state.4. MichiganSen. Debbie StabenowAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileMichigan remains the most competitive open seat on this list. Democrat Elissa Slotkin has held a narrow edge in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, but the absence of an incumbent and the competitiveness of the presidential race in the Wolverine State\u00a0makes it one that could come down to the wire.Slotkin, a third-term congresswoman, led Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers 47% to 42% among likely voters in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll, with Slotkin drawing 6% of likely voters who also said they would vote for Trump. Slotkin has a strong fundraising record \u2013 her campaign announced raising $18 million in the third quarter \u2013 but Republicans are pouring more money into this state, with the Senate Leadership Fund recently announcing a $22.5 million investment.Slotkin has been runningads on abortion\u2013 an issue that has helped propel recent Democratic victories in the state. Herspotsclaim that Rogers\u2019 past support for abortion restrictions makes him untrustworthy on the issue now. \u201cI\u2019m scared that Mike Rogers will continue to take away my rights,\u201d says one woman in a spot who says she needed an abortion to save her life.Rogers has been responding on air, speaking directly to camera while holding hands with his wife inone new spot,saying he respects Michigan voters\u2019 decision on abortion rights and \u201cwon\u2019t do anything to change it\u201d in the Senate.Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, scored the endorsement of the state Farm Bureau\u2019s PAC, which had previously backed Stabenow (the chair of the Senate Agriculture panel). Rogers, whom Democrats have attacked for living in Florida after he left Congress a decade ago, is runningspotsthat tout his Michigan roots and public service. Rogers and Republicans are alsoattacking Slotkinandthe Biden administrationover plans to support the building of electric vehicles, using the misleading term \u201cmandate.\u201d5. PennsylvaniaSen. Bob CaseyAndrew Harnik/Getty ImagesDemocratic Sen. Bob Casey\u2019s race against Republican challenger Dave McCormick moves two spots up on the list in light of heavy GOP outside spending, some tighter polling and the competitiveness of the presidential race in a\u00a0state that is part of Democrats\u2019 so-called blue wall of must-win states.September polling from Marist, Quinnipiac University, the New York Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer, Franklin & Marshall, CBS News/YouGov and Fox News all gave Casey anywhere from a 5- to 9-point lead among likely voters. Polls from CNN and The Washington Post around the same time, however, showed no clear leader.The two candidates, who met on the debate stage for the first time Thursday night, have been hitting the airwaves with competing messages, as have their allied outside groups. Democrats are going after McCormick onabortion,includingonead that features footage of him referring to himself as \u201cpro-life.\u201d The Senate Leadership Fund, which is adding $28 million to GOP sending here, and the pro-McCormickKeystone Renewal PAChave been attacking Casey over inflation andimmigration.McCormick\u2019s tenure as the CEO of FreeMarkets \u2013 a Pittsburgh-based software company \u2013 has also been featured in ads on both sides.The Democratic group WinSenateis accusing him ofoutsourcing jobsand pointing to his management of the company to argue that \u201cConnecticut Dave\u201d\u00a0 \u2013 he owns a home in the Nutmeg State \u2013 \u201cwants to buy our Senate seat.\u201d McCormick is running ads featuringformer FreeMarkets employeespraising him and touting the company\u2019s hiring policies.6. WisconsinSen. Tammy BaldwinMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesWisconsin also moves up two spots on the list amid signs that some Republicans could be drifting home toward their party\u2019s nominee, Eric Hovde, in his challenge to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.The two-term senator maintained a modest edge over Hovde in aMarquette University Law School pollreleased this week \u2013 51% to 45% among likely voters when third-party candidates are included and 53% to 46% in a head-to-head matchup. Baldwin had a similar 7-point lead in aNew York Times/Siena College surveyof the two-person race\u00a0taken around the same time.While Baldwin has repeatedly outraised Hovde, the Senate Leadership Fund is also pouring funds \u2013 $17 million \u2013 into the Badger State, and Hovde has plenty of his own money to pay for ads at the lower candidate rate if he chooses. (We\u2019ll be eying his third-quarter fundraising filing for details about how much the Sunwest Bank CEO had loaned his campaign through September.) Ads from Hovde \u2013 whose campaign recently underwent a shakeup \u2013 havesought to tie Baldwinto Harris, attacking her over border security, fentanyl andtransgender rights.But Baldwin, who\u2019s made an effort tovisit the red, rural parts of Wisconsin, has a well-defined brand. She picked up theendorsementof the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation this week \u2013 a notable get for a Democrat running statewide. Much of Democratic advertising has played up Hovde\u2019s past controversial comments and sought to cast him as a California carpetbagger \u2013 he owns property in Laguna Beach, even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin and his family\u2019s company is a prominent state brand.7. ArizonaSen. Kyrsten SinemaAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileArizona is a conservative-leaning purple state, where Republicans should ordinarily be able to pick off a Senate seat \u2013 especially an open one. But in the race to replace retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, Republican candidate Kari Lake seems to have hit a ceiling.The 2022 gubernatorial nominee is well known in the state, but not necessarily for the right reasons. She still refuses to accept her loss for governor and, despite tethering herself to Trump, is underperforming his polling numbers.Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego led Lake by 10 points among likely voters in aMarist polland 13 points in aFox News survey, both from mid-September. Lake was polling behind Trump in both surveys by 6 points and 8 points respectively.Lake and the NRSC areblaming Gallegofor inflation and immigration \u2013 pointing to his support for what they\u2019re calling the \u201cKamala Inflation Act.\u201d (Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.) And while the Senate Leadership Fund hasn\u2019t spent here, a Club for Growth-affiliated group is also airingattackson the congressman. Gallego, a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was on the airwaves for months introducing himself to voters statewide as a Marine veteran and istouting his supportfrom law enforcement andRepublican voters. He announced raising $21.7 million in the third quarter.8. NevadaSen. Jacky RosenAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileNevada moves down two spots on the list as Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen appears to be in a stronger position against Republican opponent Sam Brown in a state where Democratic prospects seem to have picked up since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.Rosen, who appeared at a Harris rally in Las Vegas earlier this week, led Brown by 10 points in aCNN pollin late August. Like Lake in Arizona, Brown \u2013 an Army veteran who first ran for office in Texas and lost the GOP primary for Nevada\u2019s other Senate seat last year \u2013 also appears to be running up against a ceiling.Rosen and Democrats are hitting Brownover his previous stances on abortion\u2013 which is on the ballot this year in Nevada. Brown, who says he supports current state law legalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks, has said he\u2019d \u201cclose the door\u201d on backing a national abortion ban.Rosen has had a fundraising edge over her opponent, and this week, national Republicans canceled their remaining independent expenditures in the state in favor of running hybrid ads with Brown, which allows them to benefit from the lower candidate rate in the ultra-pricey Las Vegas media market \u2014 a strategy they\u2019ve employed in races across the country to try to compete with well-funded Democratic candidates on the airwaves.9. TexasSen. Ted CruzTierney L. Cross/Getty Images/FileNational Democrats\u2019 decision toinvest TV resourcesin Texas was the first major signal the party is putting money where its mouth is on the competitiveness of the Lone Star State this year. Democrats see Republican Sen. Ted Cruz as unpopular and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred, as the man to beat him, even in a state that is still comfortably red at the presidential level.The first hybridadbetween Allred and the DSCC features Kate Cox, the woman who had to leave the state to seek an abortion after her fetus had been diagnosed with a deadly condition, and Amanda Zurawski, who sued the state after she was denied an abortion when experiencing complications. \u201cIf you\u2019re experiencing pregnancy complications in Texas, you\u2019re in danger,\u201d Zurawski says in the ad, \u201cand it\u2019s Ted Cruz and the anti-abortion extremists\u2019 fault.\u201dAllred has also tried to flip the script on Republicans byaccusing Cruzof \u201cdoing nothing to secure the border.\u201d Cruz, in turn, isattacking Allredover a vote related to the inclusion of transgender athletes in women\u2019s sports. \u201cBoys and girls are different,\u201d is how anotheradfrom the Republican opens. \u201cThis election is about keeping Texas Texas,\u201d Cruz has said.Cruz only beat Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke by 3 points in 2018. But Democrats hope that Allred, a former NFL player who flipped a Dallas-area House seat the same year, is a more formidable challenger and can turn out more minority voters. (Allred would be the state\u2019s first Black senator if he wins.)Even Republicans acknowledge that Allred is running a good race, and the NRSC is investing here to help Cruz and the state party. Still, Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, so this remains an uphill battle for Allred.10. MarylandSen. Ben CardinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/GettyImages/FileThe race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin remains in tenth place this month as Angela Alsobrooks fights to keep this seat in party hands. Joe Biden won Maryland by 33 points in 2020, but Republican nominee Larry Hogan \u2013 a popular former two-term governor \u2013 has a supportive super PAC committing $18 million to tout hisindependence.Alsobrooks, the Prince George\u2019s County executive, led Hogan by 11 points in a recentWashington Post/University of Maryland poll. She\u2019s become better known statewide and has made gains among voters who say they care about Democrats maintaining control of the Senate. The argument that Hogan would be another vote for Senate Republicans has been Democrats\u2019central pitchin deep-blue Maryland, especially onabortion rightsand Trump.Voters in the Post survey were split over whether Hogan would back his party\u2019s leaders in the Senate. He\u2019s winning nearly half of independents, as well as 18% of Democrats. And as he tries to combat Democratic attacks over abortion rights, he\u2019s run ads about being\u201cthe ultimate girl dad\u201dand \u201cone of the few Republicans who never caved\u201d to Trump. Hogan rejected the former president\u2019s endorsement earlier this year, but Democrats quickly seized on Trump saying that he\u2019d like to see Hogan win.Maryland\u2019s Future, the super PAC backing Hogan, is trying to localize the race byattacking Alsobrooksfor improperly taking advantage of tax breaks she did not qualify for, as firstreported by CNN. (Her senior adviser told CNN that she was unaware of the problem and that her attorneys are working with both the District of Columbia and Prince George\u2019s County to resolve the issue.)CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report."}, {"title": "As Harris makes case for presidency, her record as prosecutor draws fresh scrutiny", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/harris-prosecutor-scrutiny-invs/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014When Kamala Harris famously refused to seek the death penalty against a young gang member accused of killing a cop\u202ftwo decades ago, she said then\u202fthat her opposition to capital punishment was well-reasoned and absolute.Even under pressure from the late Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who received a standing ovation when she called for the death penalty at the officer\u2019s funeral, Harris, then 39, stood strong.\u201cFor those who want this defendant put to death, let me say simply that there can be no exception to principle,\u201d she wrote in an opinion piece published in the San Francisco Chronicle in 2004, shortly after being elected the city\u2019s first female district attorney.In this 2004 photo, then-District Attorney Kamala Harris waits for a proceeding to convene in San Francisco.Paul Chinn/The San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images\u201cI gave my word to the people of San Francisco that I oppose the death penalty,\u201dHarris wrote, \u201cand I will honor that commitment despite the strong emotions evoked by this case.\u201dJust four years later, however, Harris pushed aside her long-held opposition to capital punishment when she announced plans to run for attorney general of California. She vowed that, if elected, she would \u201cenforce the death penalty as the law dictates.\u201dAs attorney general of California, she advocated for enforcement of a state law under which the parents of chronically truant kids could be thrown in jail. But years later, during her first campaign for president, she expressed regret that some prosecutors had actually done so, saying that was \u201cnever the intention\u201d of the law.Her shifting stance on the contentious topic is but one example of how the Democratic presidential nominee has attempted to walk the line between tough-on-crime prosecutor and progressive politician.Following the controversial police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, Harrislauncheda pilot program requiring field special agents of the California Department of Justice to begin wearing body cameras. She declined, however, to back a far more comprehensive measure favored by police reform advocates that would have provided statewide regulations on the devices.About six years later, following the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Harris noted the importance of \u201cindependent investigations\u201d into alleged police misconduct, citing the inherent problem of perceived or real conflicts of interest when such cases are investigated by local prosecutors. As California\u2019s AG, however, she declined to provide that sort of outside scrutiny to several controversial police shootings in the state.Her critics have seized on these and other perceived contradictions as evidence that she\u2019s a flip-flopping politician \u2013 \u201cachameleon\u201d as Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance has repeatedly called her. But Harris\u2019 supporters see her as an opened-minded leader unafraid to change her thinking when persuaded by evidence.Brendon Woods, who currently serves as the top public defender in Oakland, California, where Harris got her start as a prosecutor, said he has closely watched her career\u2014both as\u202fa prosecutor and as a politician\u2014and seen her change course on issues that matter to him.\u201cI think people can evolve,\u201d Woods told CNN, \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what she\u2019s done.\u201dAsked about some of her shifting stances in a CNNinterviewin August, Harris said, \u201cmy values have not changed.\u201dMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris are interviewed by CNN\u2019s Dana Bash at Kim\u2019s Cafe in Savannah, Georgia, on August 29.Will Lanzoni/CNNIn a statement, James Singer, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign, said, \u201cThroughout her entire career, Kamala Harris has fought to protect people and hold bad actors accountable. She took on predators, rapists, abusers, fraudsters, and gangs to get justice for the people and she will continue to fight for justice and freedom as President of the United States.\u201dAsked about Harris\u2019 change on the death penalty, a Harris aide said that the \u201crole of attorney general is different from that of district attorney,\u201d and added that Harris followed state law as AG.The long-standing problem of racial inequities in the criminal justice system is among the issues that prompted Harris to become a prosecutor in the first place.\u201cI grew up knowing about the disparities, inequities, and unfairness in the criminal justice system,\u201d Harris said during a 2019 town hall\u202fhosted\u202fby MSNBC. \u201cWhat I said to my family and friends is look, if we\u2019re going to reform these systems, we should also be on the inside where the decisions are being made. And that\u2019s why I chose to do the work I did. And I am proud of the work that I did.\u201dAs a prosecutor, Harris adopted what she called a \u201csmart on crime\u201d approach to law enforcement. It included thelaunchof a program that sought to steer non-violent offenders toward job training and away from prison, and thereleaseof statewide criminal justice data in an effort to enhance government accountability.One of Harris\u2019 boldest moves as district attorney was to launch a program aimed at preventing young people from ending up in jail or prison by making sure they stayed in school.\u201cI believe a child going without an education is tantamount to a crime,\u201d she said in a speech at San Francisco\u2019s Commonwealth Club in 2010. \u201cSo I decided I was going to start prosecuting parents for truancy.\u201d\u201cThis was a little controversial in San Francisco,\u201d she said, laughing, \u201cand frankly my staff went bananas.\u201dShe wrote in anop-edaround that time that she had \u201cprosecuted 20 parents of young children for truancy\u201d and that the crime carried a potential sentence of up to a year in jail.She never put anyone in jail, Harris would later say, but her program became the\u202fbasis\u202fof a\u202fbill\u202fthat made it a criminal misdemeanor for parents to let their kindergarten-through-eighth-grade children miss 10% or more of class without valid excuses. Those convicted\u202fare\u202fpunishable by a fine not exceeding $2,000, or by \u201cimprisonment in a county jail for a period not exceeding one year.\u201dHarris testified about the issue to the state senate. She\u202fsaid, \u201cThrough the power of the prosecutor\u2019s office we have an incredible carrot and stick. The carrot of course being to hopefully encourage good behaviors. And the stick outlining what will be punishment or severe consequences when those good behaviors \u2026 are not followed.\u201dAfter the bill\u202fpassed\u202fin 2010,\u202fsome\u202fdistrict attorneys took action.\u202fDozens of parents have since been arrested or even jailed by other prosecutors for allegedly allowing their children to miss too many classes, according to\u202flocal\u202fgovernment\u202fpress releases.Among those arrested were\u202fAyman Haddadin\u202fand his wife, Alice, who live in Orange County, south of Los Angeles.\u202fThe couple was accused by local prosecutors in 2011 of allowing their middle-school-age child to accumulate 12 unexcused absences in a school year, failing to respond to notices or attend a meeting about the issue and permitting absences in prior years.In a recent interview with CNN, Ayman Haddadin said his son\u202fhad struggled with chronic allergies that were often exacerbated at school, so he racked up absences that he believes should have been excused.\u201cIf he can\u2019t breathe,\u201d he said of his son, \u201che can\u2019t function.\u201dEven though his family had sought to discuss the issue with school administrators, Haddadin told CNN, police showed up at his home just after dawn and took him and his wife, who was still in her pajamas, into custody. They were hauled off in handcuffs, he said,\u202fand details of their arrest were spotlighted in local media reports.The spectacle, he said, affected his whole family.\u201cI remember being absolutely terrified,\u201d his now-adult son, Connor Haddadin, who had accumulated the absences, said of his parents\u2019 arrests. \u201cIt was extremely wrong and traumatic.\u201dAyman Haddadin said the case was ultimately dismissed. A spokesperson for the Orange County District Attorney\u2019s office said the case against the Haddadins is sealed and declined further comment.Another parent caught up in the May 2011 truancy sweep in Orange County said she was a single mom working two jobs to support her five kids.Following her arrest, during which a photo of her in handcuffs was publicized in local media, she said she lost one of her jobs working as a line cook at a restaurant and her family was shunned by the community.\u201cThere has to be another way,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s inhumane.\u201dHarris, who for years had advocated on behalf of prosecutors getting involved in truancy cases, has since expressed regret about the \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of parents being prosecuted and jailed, \u201cbecause that was never the intention.\u201dBut Alice Haddadin questioned those statements from Harris. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can consider that an unintended consequence because she created the law,\u201d she told CNN.As attorney general of California, Harris had attained the ultimate position for changing the state\u2019s criminal justice system from within, as she had set out to do as a young lawyer.She was California\u2019s \u201ctop cop\u201d and had a wide purview to set policy and right wrongs in the manner she saw fit.On the campaign trail as a presidential candidate, she routinely touts her record as California\u2019s top prosecutor, including the way she says shetook onbig banks that foreclosed on people\u2019s homes andprosecutedMexican drug cartels and other transnational criminal organizations.But she was also faulted by critics\u2014some of whom had once been her supporters\u2014for not doing enough during her time as AG.In 2015, following the widespread civil unrest in the wake of the police killing of Brown in Ferguson, Missouri the previous summer, Harris began requiring special agents working for the state Department of Justice to wear body cameras when on duty.This January 2014 file photo shows a Los Angeles police officer wearing a body camera during a demonstration for media.Damian Dovarganes/APHarris, however, declined to support a bill that would have imposed statewide regulations impacting throughout the Golden State.Harris balked at the aim of the proposed law, warning against a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d regulation.Her cautious stance on the issue frustrated many advocates of criminal justice reform, including those who expressed support for Harris on other issues.Bryce Peterson, a lecturer at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who has studied police body-cam policy and implementation across the country, said Harris declining to back the legislation may have been a missed opportunity for leadership on the issue.\u201cYou\u2019re never going to get police officers to change or agencies to change, unless they\u2019re spurred in one way or another,\u201d he said.Another area that has drawn scrutiny was Harris\u2019 apparent resistance to using the broad powers of the AG\u2019s office to conduct independent probes into fatal police shootings.As AG, Harris declined to support a 2015 bill by Democratic Assemblyman\u00a0Kevin McCarty from Sacramento that would have required the state to conduct such probes, as opposed to county prosecutors who may appear biased due to their close working relationship with local police.\u201cThe African American and civil rights community have been disappointed that (Harris) hasn\u2019t come out stronger on this,\u201d McCarty, a member of California\u2019s Legislative Black Caucus, told the Los Angeles Times in 2016.Aside from not backing the bill, Harris declined to investigate controversial fatal police shootings in Los Angeles, Anaheim and her former hometown of San Francisco, in which local officials declined to file charges against officers. The suspects in Los Angeles and Anaheim were unarmed; the man killed in San Francisco had a knife.In the immediate aftermath of the shooting in Anaheim, the city\u2019s then-mayor, Tom Tait, called on Harris to conduct an independent probe during a press conference in which scores of protestors packed the lobby of the Anaheim Police Department.\u201cI believed we needed an independent outside investigation to get to the truth of what happened,\u201d Tait told CNN in September. \u201cI thought this would have helped provide credibility and public trust in our justice system.\u201dHarris opted not to get involved, he said.McCarty told CNN that, despite the disappointment he voiced in 2016, Harris later helped shape a subsequent law mandating the attorney general\u2019s involvement in investigating fatal police shootings of unarmed suspects.\u201cI applaud Kamala Harris for helping lay the foundation to make this a reality,\u201d he said.Years later, after being elected to the US Senate and launching her first campaign for president, Harris noted the importance of the sort of \u201cindependent investigations\u201d she had declined to provide as attorney general.She did so in the wake of yet another high-profile police killing \u2013 one that would ignite a global movement \u2013 that of Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020.Speaking to colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Harris asked for their support in passing a new federal law, one that would help ensure independent oversight in cases in which local prosecutors have a perceived or real conflict of interest with investigating the officers in question.\u201cAs a former prosecutor,\u201d she said, \u201cI know that independent investigations into police misconduct are imperative.\u201d"}, {"title": "3 charts that help explain how Trump\u2019s tariffs would work", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/donald-trump-tariffs/index.html", "content": "WashingtonCNN\u2014If former President Donald Trump returns to the White House, tariffs will once again play a major role in hispolicy agenda.Trump has repeatedly said he plans to impose an across-the-board tariff of either 10% or 20% on every import coming into the US, as well as a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports, in a bid to encourage American manufacturing.\u201cTariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,\u201d Trump said last month at a town hall event in Michigan.But as with many economic policies, there are trade-offs, and Trump doesn\u2019t talk about the negative effect tariffs could have on US businesses and consumers. He\u2019s also oftenfalsely describedhow tariffs work.Vice President Kamala Harris has referred to her opponent\u2019s tariff policy as a \u201cTrump Tax.\u201d Several independent studies have found that the new tariffs, if implemented, would raise costs for the average middle-class family, with estimates ranging between $1,350 and $3,900 a year.Here are three charts to help explain the impact of tariffs:For years, Trump has inaccurately claimed that foreign countries pay the tariffs. But in reality, the tariff is paid by the US-based company that imports the good.Studyafterstudy, includingone from the federal government\u2019s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, has\u00a0found\u00a0that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese products.In total, Trump\u2019s previous tariff actions put duties on about 14% of US imports \u2013 a relatively small share compared with the across-the-board tariff he has pledged to implement on 100% of imports if elected.When Trump was in office, he implemented tariffs on about $380 billion worth of goods imported into the US, according toa Tax Foundationanalysis.These duties applied to thousands of Chinese-made products, includingbaseball hats, luggage,bicycles, TVs andsneakers.The Trump tariffs also hit foreign steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar panels.The Biden-Harris administration has kept most of these tariffs in place andincreased the rate of some of the duties.Trump has said that if he wins the election,his administration coulduse tariffsto boost domestic manufacturing, create jobs and bring in billions of dollars to help pay for other policy initiatives.He\u2019s proposed extending tax cuts implemented in 2017, as well as eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay and Social Security benefits \u2013 all of which cost money.At a speech in September, Trump also said the tariff revenue couldpay for a child care initiative. AndCNBC reportedthat he\u2019s floated the idea of replacing the federal income tax with tariff revenue.\u201cEventually our country will be making substantially more money, over and above cost, and we will start a massive debt reduction,\u201d Trump said during an October speech at the Detroit Economic Club.But even if Trump implements tariffs on all US imports, the resulting revenue is unlikely to cover all these costs.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budgetrecently estimatedthat Trump\u2019s tariff plan would not generate enough revenue to pay for his other spending proposals.Ultimately, the group estimated that Trump\u2019s proposals would add $7.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.Harris\u2019 proposals, by comparison, would add an estimated $3.5 trillion."}, {"title": "House Republicans attempt to avoid 2022 letdown with new tactic on abortion: \u2018We\u2019re both pro-choice\u2019", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/house-republicans-abortion-strategy-elections/index.html", "content": "For more on the House Republican strategy on abortion issues, watch CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics with Manu Raju,\u201d this Sunday at 8 a.m. ET.\ufeffWashingtonCNN\u2014Republicans in the nation\u2019s toughest House districts are making a major pivot on abortion with a surprising result \u2014 they\u2019re starting to sound like Democrats.GOP candidates in suburbs of places like Tucson, Des Moines and Syracuse are going public with vows never to criminalize abortion or support a national ban. Some are going further: Rep.John Duarteof California\u2019s Central Valley, Rep. Tom Kean Jr. in northern New Jersey and GOP candidate Matt Gunderson in the San Diego area have all described themselves as \u201cpro choice\u201d \u2014 with the latter even speaking directly to camera in his first TV ad and borrowing Bill Clinton\u2019s phrase calling for the procedure to be \u201csafe, legal and rare.\u201dIn this fall\u2019s toss-up battle for the House, swing-seat Republicans are carefully rebranding themselves on abortion after largely failing to respond to relentless Democratic attacks that cost the GOP big last cycle. And they\u2019re attempting to neutralize the Democrats\u2019 most potent attack \u2014 all in an effort to turn voters\u2019 attention to the US-Mexico border and other galvanizing issues.\u201cSince we\u2019re both pro-choice, then we have an opportunity to take that conversation, set it aside and have a real serious conversation about solving the border, about inflation, the economy, jobs, crime, education,\u201d Gunderson said in an interview, referring to his opponent, Democratic Rep. Mike Levin.It may be easier said than done.Even as swing-seat Republicans attempt to paint a more nuanced view of the GOP\u2019s stance on abortion, the national party has often muddled that message. In recent days, former first lady Melania Trump disclosed she supports the right to an abortion \u201cfree from any intervention\u201d \u2014 while Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, took the staunchly conservative position of vowing to defund Planned Parenthood.And it all underscores a critical weakness for the GOP fewer than 30 days from the election. The party still struggles to respond to an issue that makes up the vast majority of Democratic attacks this cycle: 80% of spending on TV ads by the House Democrats\u2019 two main groups went to ads focusing on abortion. And it\u2019s been particularly effective against GOP incumbents with well-documented comments on abortion \u2014 like Rep. Zach Nunn of Iowa \u2014 that Democrats have turned into attack ads.\u201cYou can\u2019t hide from it,\u201d said Rep. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican from North Dakota, reflecting on the lessons Republicans learned in the 2022 midterms. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really have a plan for what had happened.\u201dDemocrats say their foes\u2019 efforts to show a softer side on abortion won\u2019t work.\u201cHe\u2019s going to probably say anything he needs to say to try to win and see what sticks,\u201d Levin, a three-term Democrat who cut an ad responding to Gunderson, told CNN.\u201cWe know that if Mike Johnson is empowered, that there are many around here that would try to get a national abortion ban in place,\u201d Levin said, even as his opponent said he\u2019d oppose both a national ban and a bill to codify Roe, saying the issue should be left up to the states.Behind closed doors, Republican leaders have spent months working with battleground candidates, particularly in New York and California, to sell a more moderate message on the issue. The House GOP campaign chief, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, has advised fellow Republicans to clearly articulate their views \u2014 or face globs of Democratic spending to distort their position.And they\u2019ve been far more aggressive in calling out some misleading Democratic ads, which have accused Republican candidates of supporting strict abortion bans or opposing exceptions for abortion even when that candidate is on the record with a more moderate position. In some cases, like in pivotal seats inNorth CarolinaandVirginia, fact-checkers have agreed.Hudson accused Democrats of \u201ccreating a false and distorted impression\u201d of the GOP\u2019s abortion position in the 2022 midterms and attacked Democrats for espousing their own \u201cextreme\u201d views on the issue.\u201cTo fight back, we have encouraged our candidates to be open, direct and empathetic about their position \u2013 and nonpartisan fact-checkers have responded, picking apart a litany of Democratic attack ads for telling blatant lies,\u201d Hudson told CNN.Sarah Chamberlain, who runs the centrist-leaning Republican Mainstreet Partnership, recalled warning a prominent GOP pollster the day of the\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0Supreme Court decision that it would be a huge issue for women voters. He initially told her she was wrong, but phoned her after the midterms to admit his miscalculation. Since then, Chamberlain has used her own polling to help convince key swing-seat House Republicans to shift their approach.\u201cDon\u2019t use the \u2018A word.\u2019 Talk about it as women\u2019s health care,\u201d Chamberlain said. \u201cThe economy, immigration \u2014 there\u2019s tons of things we can win on and should win on. But this issue is still very strong.\u201dDemocrats cry hypocrisyIn some cases, Republicans are trying to walk back \u2014 or completely abandon \u2014 their past anti-abortion rights views.When he first ran for Congress in 2022 for a seat in Washington state, GOP candidate Joe Kenttold a local news station: \u201cI would move to have a national ban on abortion.\u201dThis time, Kentfilmed an adstating: \u201cI oppose any new federal legislation on the issue.\u201dKent\u2019s opponent \u2014 Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez \u2014 called out his shifting position in a recentcandidate debate, accusing him of playing \u201cboth sides of this card\u201d and saying \u201cwhat the pollsters tell him to say.\u201dAnd he\u2019s not the only one whose public position has changed. Nunn, the endangered Republican in Iowa, is fighting for his political survival as Democrats devote a majority of their TV ads to the issue in this suburban battleground.Nunn\u2019s Democratic opponent, Lanon Baccam, hasattacked the GOP incumbentwith a clip from the Republican primary debate in 2022 when Nunn raised his hand to say all abortions should be illegal in the country. Nunn has not responded to the issue of abortion on air.And in the key California race to hold Levin\u2019s seat, the main Democratic super PAC \u2014 House Majority PAC \u2014 has reserved $1.5 million to begin next week in an effort to target Gunderson. Abortion attacks are expected to be part of the mix.Levin has seized on Gunderson\u2019s opposition to a 2022 California abortion rights referendum, which the Republican previously referred to as \u201cdisgusting\u201d in a meeting with voters.\u201cWhat I did say was that late-term abortion is disgusting,\u201d Gunderson told CNN when asked about those remarks, arguing the referendum \u201copened up a Pandora\u2019s box to late-term abortion.\u201dDemocratic leaders say Republicans are trying to muddy the waters.\u201cThis is a desperation move by Republicans,\u201d said House Democrats\u2019 campaign chief, Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state. \u201cPeople know where they stand.\u201dPro-women language but unclear on specificsIn 2022, Democrats dumped a half-billion dollars\u2019 worth of abortion attacks into pivotal races and helped prevent a GOP wave. This time, Republicans, like freshman Rep. Marc Molinaro, who is defending a tough upstate New York seat, are looking to take that issue off the table for Democrats.Molinaro was one of the first Republicans this cycle to launch a TV ad devoted solely to his stance on abortion.\u201cI believe in supporting all women and the choices they make,\u201d Molinaro says, speaking into the camera, in the ad.But even as he has sought to counter Democratic attacks, he hasn\u2019t been entirely clear on what positions he does support. While the New York Republican touted support for \u201cbroad access\u201d to birth control and blocking efforts to ban mifepristone in an interview, he didn\u2019t offer a clear answer when asked if he supports restoring\u00a0Roe\u00a0or if he considers himself \u201cpro choice.\u201d\u201cI describe it as somebody who says that the decision and the choice on reproductive health is between you and your physician. Immaterial of anything else, that\u2019s what I believe,\u201d Molinaro told CNN. As for his decision to speak up on abortion, Molinaro added: \u201cI think it\u2019s important that people see me explain to them that I respect the choice they make and that they have my support.\u201dHe isn\u2019t the only Republican looking to keep their distance from the Dobbs decision.Duarte, the vulnerable California Republican, refused to say if he supports the 2022 decision that struck down Roe.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s done. It\u2019s in the rearview mirror,\u201d Duarte told CNN. \u201cAnd the fact is that abortion is back in the states where it belongs.\u201dAnd the congressman contended that his position \u2014 and Trump\u2019s position \u2014 that the matter should be left up to the states is effectively pro-abortion rights.\u201cI am pro-choice,\u201d Duarte said, arguing that Trump is even \u201cfunctionally pro-choice,\u201d though the former president regularly boasts about appointing three Supreme Court justices who struck down Roe and plans to vote against a Florida abortion rights referendum this fall.Another battleground Republican, Rep. Juan Ciscomani of southern Arizona, went up with his own TV ad this fall saying he opposes a federal abortion ban and supports abortion in the cases of certain exceptions, such as protecting the life of the mother.In adebatethis week, Ciscomani added that he also opposed his state\u2019s Civil War-era ban on nearly all abortions, which was recently repealed. But he didn\u2019t say how he\u2019ll vote this November on his state\u2019s ballot measure to enshrine rights to an abortion up to the point of viability, saying only that it was a state issue.And when asked about what he was trying to sell to voters with his ad, Ciscomani simply said: \u201cMy position.\u201d"}, {"title": "Trump suggests using military against \u2018enemy from within\u2019 on Election Day", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/trump-military-enemy-from-within-election-day/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Former President Donald Trump suggested using the military to handle what he called \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d on Election Day, saying that he isn\u2019t worried about chaos from his supporters or foreign actors, but instead from \u201cradical left lunatics.\u201d\u201cI think the bigger problem are the people from within.

A dozen\u00a0of the 4,500 people packing a gym on the University of Pittsburgh campus on Thursday night told CNN in interviews that they still feel connected to him \u2014 including a 15-year-old named Kai Jones, wearing a T-shirt printed with the famous photo of Obama and Biden jogging through the Rose Garden.\u00a0Jones, who wasn\u2019t yet born in 2008, said\u00a0Obama \u201chas a special place in my heart.\u201dBut\u00a0if\u00a0the question remains:\u00a0Can Obama draw in those young Black men?\u00a0On Thursday in Pittsburgh, there weren\u2019t as many of those faces in the crowd.\u201cThe fact that he has not been in the day-to-day political scene, people don\u2019t see him in the partisan muck that everybody else,\u201d Austin Davis, the Pennsylvania lieutenant governor and a 35-year-old Black man himself, told CNN ahead of the rally. \u201cYou have to think about the type of people who naturally show up to political rallies. It\u2019s not just the crowd here, it\u2019s the crowd that\u2019s watching at home.\u201dCampaign strategy meetings and advice on WashingtonMost of the Democratic work Obama has been doing the last few years has been behind the scenes. A lot has been with Hakeem Jeffries, the New York congressman hoping to become the next speaker of the House whose connection to the former president runs so deep that, as he sometimes points out, he has the same birthday and his wife is also named Michelle.After their own one-on-one meeting, Obama asked Jeffries to suggest a few small groups of Democratic House members for trips to his office in the World Wildlife Federation in northwest Washington. The members ranged from New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to much lesser known and less progressive\u00a0up-and-comers, like Washington Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola. He talked to them about coming off like real people rather than scolding coastal elites and staying consistent rather than\u00a0being\u00a0pulled into the whirlwind of Washington consultant advice, according to people in the room.Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump looks on during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on October 5, 2024.Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleAs Trump delays transition process, Biden and Harris teams push forward with post-election planningSeveral took written notes, including a nervous congressman who watched Obama play with an aide\u2019s child before their meeting started and wrote down to focus on learning how to charm babies, according to one of the people who saw it.Obama\u2019s session last November with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the incumbent Democratic senators running in 2024 was more focused on briefing Obama on their races so he could better understand their challenges and offer support.\u201cIt was great to be able to begin the strategy with him,\u201d said Pennsylvania Sen.

Mark Kelly said he\u2019s ready to step forward and help pull Harris and other Democrats over the line.Asked whether he was ready to see Obama hold to his theory of turning over to the next generation of Democrats, Kelly said, \u201cNot yet.\u201dNavigating Biden and coming around on HarrisObama had hoped to start stepping back when Biden won. Neither president was thrilled with how the last few years played out between them.Long before Biden\u2019s dismal debate in June, the president had been complaining privately that Obama wasn\u2019t helping enough, according to several people who spoke to Biden. Biden aides sensed a jealousy from Obama\u2019s orbit that they were racking up more accomplishments than he had, with senior adviser Mike Donilon saying once in private conversation, \u201cThey need to get over it,\u201d according to one of the people who heard it \u2014 and Biden aides hated the Republican conspiracy theory that Obama was actually pulling the strings.For over a year, when Biden wanted a former president sounding board, he was ringing up Bill Clinton instead.After Biden\u2019s debate debacle, diehards burned that Obama had left the president to twist in the wind when he could have more forcefully ended the questions, while many Democrats suffering through that month felt he was going feckless again. Many calls came in.Biden\u2019s dropping out sparked its own Obama drama, and not just because the president\u2019s immediate endorsement of Harris came with the added benefit of demonstrating a deference he often complained he never got from his old boss. While most of the party leaders Harris calledthat Sunday afternoon, including Bill Clinton, immediately pledged support, Obama held off. He offered advice and encouragement but told her he wanted to make sure the process was seen as legitimate in a way it might not have if he had jumped out early.Harris advisers knew Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi favored an open process to find a new nominee. What some couldn\u2019t figure out was how much of that was Obama\u2019s doubts and disappointments about Harris from her 2019 campaign and early vice presidency shining through, and how much was a political calculation that she would be better off if she emerged after a process rather than a coronation.Former President Bill Clinton speaks at the DNC on Wednesday, August 21, in Chicago.Rebecca Wright/CNNRelated articleBill Clinton to hit battleground states for HarrisSeveral people familiar with Obama\u2019s thinking said that he thought she was in the strongest position starting out, but he believed others would run \u2014 and that he was pleased to see her talking that week about earning the nomination even as others didn\u2019t. When the Obamas called Harris that Wednesday to officially endorse, his argument was that he was acting as the closer, certifying party unity, even as some outsiders complained it looked like he had held out as long as he could.Obama and Biden have spoken once since the president\u00a0dropped out. Obama initiated\u00a0the conversation, telling aides to let the White House know he was eager for a call whenever Biden had time, and they soon spoke. It wasn\u2019t the two presidents\u2019 deepest or longest conversation. Obama said he appreciated all that Biden had done as president, and how hard stepping aside was. He said he loved him like a brother\u00a0and\u00a0always would. Biden took the call to heart, without hard feelings. He thanked Obama for reaching out.Obama has had several conversations with Harris, whom he first got to know through an informal network of up-and-coming Black politicians when he was a state senator and she was a district attorney. One centered entirely on her running mate selection, though he was giving his take on how she should approach the process rather than weighing in for one candidate. Others have been to help guide her through everything from staffing decisions to bigger picture strategy. And according to people who know about the conversations, he checks in with several of his own closest aides now helping run Harris\u2019 campaign, such as current campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon and his own 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe.In both public and in private conversations, Obama has heaped praise on Harris for the way she\u2019s campaigned and what she\u2019s campaigning on.Meanwhile, conversations are underway to get Michelle Obama to carry through withher own \u201cdo something\u201d speechfrom August\u2019s Democratic National Convention.

He doesn\u2019t feel it yet.

With the energy around Harris flagging, the prods he debuted in Pittsburgh go far beyond how he called out young Black men: viciously mocking Trump as an out-of-touch and self-centered whiner, tearing into Trump\u2019s claims of credit for managing a good economy, then finishing with a long \u201cWhy would we go along with this?\u201d section about Trump\u2019s division and disinformation that betrayed Obama\u2019s deep frustration with the Republican nominee\u2019s hold on America.Onstage, Obama was riffing so much that he picked up a shoutout from the crowd about Trump wearing a diaper.\u201cI almost said it, but I decided I should not say it,\u201d he said with a big smile and shake of his head.When Obama feels like a speech has caught the way he wanted it to, he smacks the side of the lectern.

According to the state\u2019s board of elections, there are 481,000 registered Republicans in the 25 counties, compared with 293,000 Democrats.Trump campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement that the proposals to expand voting access in North Carolina \u201cwill ensure the people who have already suffered from the storm don\u2019t lose their right to participate in this important election.\u201d\u201cSwift action from the North Carolina General Assembly and the Governor will ensure the people of their state have their voices heard on November 5th,\u201d they said.\u2018Too big to rig\u2019Trump has previouslyreleased videosand messageson his social mediapromoting early and mail-in voting as part of the Republican National Committee\u2019s get-out-the-vote program. Both methods of voting are promoted at Trump\u2019s campaign rallies.But that push has at times led to conflicting messaging from the former president.Last month, at a rally inIndiana, Pennsylvania, Trump disparaged early voting, and promoted it, in the same breath.\u201cWe got to get out and vote. And you can start right away. You know that, right? Now we have this stupid stuff where you can vote 45 days early. I wonder what the hell happens during that 45. \u2018Let\u2019s move, see these votes? We\u2019ve got about a million votes in there. Let\u2019s move them. We\u2019re fixing the air conditioner in the room, right?\u2019 No, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat happened the last time was disgraceful, including right here. But we\u2019re not going to let it happen again. You know, too big to rig, right?

Roy Cooper on Thursday, gave the 25 counties in the federally declared disaster area additional flexibility to run their elections. The law contains provisions similar to several of Trump\u2019s proposals, including giving counties more flexibility on early voting hours and allowing counties to use temporary voting locations if precincts are unusable.Destroyed homes are seen in Chimney Rock, North Carolina, on October 2, 2024, after the passage of Hurricane Helene.Allison Joyce/AFP/Getty Images\u201cI will give the Republicans who are in charge here credit for passing good legislation (Wednesday) that definitely will address needs of voters,\u201d said Bob Phillips, the executive director of Common Cause North Carolina, a group that advocates for expanded voter access. \u201cThe biggest thing is giving each of these county board of elections the flexibility with regards to voting sites, both for early voting and Election Day.\u201dThe Trump campaign also proposed expanding bipartisan teams to help voters request and deliver absentee ballots to county boards and allowing voters displaced to other counties in the state to cast provisional ballots that would be delivered back to their home county.In Georgia, however,where Helene also caused significant damage,\u00a0Republicans\u00a0opposed an attempt to\u00a0expand voter access. The Republican National Committee intervened as a defendant in a lawsuit brought by civil rights groups to extend the county\u2019s voter registration deadline, which was Monday.A federal judge on Thursdaydenied that motion, saying it \u201clacked clarity and detail\u201d as to how specific individuals were harmed.A similar lawsuit over the voter registration deadline in Florida \u2013 which is still determining the damage inflicted byHurricane Milton\u2013 was also dismissed by a federal judge on Wednesday.An RNC spokesperson said liberal groups in Georgia were trying to use the courts to extend registration deadlines enacted by the legislature, when voters have had months to register to vote in Georgia.\u201cAs many Americans are still reeling from the impact of Hurricane Helene, the Trump Campaign and RNC are fighting to expand voting access for those displaced, and we are meeting voters where they are to ensure they are educated on voting changes,\u201d said RNC spokesperson Anna Kelly.Trump and his allies have argued there\u2019s a difference in changes approved by a legislature \u2013 like the campaign asked North Carolina to do \u2013 and many of the changes that were made in 2020 by election boards during the pandemic.Voting rights advocates say while the circumstances are different between a pandemic and a hurricane, the idea of allowing displaced voters to participate in an election should be the same.\u201cEven to the extent these disasters cause different hurdles, the policy solutions are often the same,\u201d said Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center. \u201cExpanded access is key, and in order to expand access, funding is key. The things we\u2019re advocating for right now in North Carolina and Florida, in many ways, echo the things we were advocating for in 2020.\u201d"}, {"title": "Why do we still have the Electoral College?", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/electoral-college-what-matters/index.html", "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter.

They wanted electors to actually debate and consider multiple options.That\u2019s not a new way of thinking, either. Alexander Hamilton \u2014 who wrote the ultimate defense of the Electoral College when he praised it as a perfect system in Federalist No. 68 \u2014 was part of a plot to exploit it in the 1800 presidential election, and in 1802, he waswriting a draftof a constitutional amendment to change it.In the intervening centuries, both chambers of Congress have voted to change the Electoral College \u2014 most recently in 1969 \u2014 but these efforts all ultimately failed. If, as is possible, one candidate gets more votes in November and the other candidate gets the White House, expect a new round of bellyaching about this anachronism that somehow lives on.A new book dissects the history of the Electoral College. Its author, Carolyn Dupont, a history professor at Eastern Kentucky University who describes herself as a moderate Democrat, comes down in favor of adopting a national popular vote model. The book is called, \u201cDistorting Democracy: The Forgotten History of the Electoral College and Why It Matters Today.\u201dI talked to Dupont about the Electoral College. Our phone conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.The founders would not recognize today\u2019s Electoral CollegeWOLF:The first part of the book is about how the Electoral College is essentially nothing like what the founders envisioned. What about today\u2019s system do you think they would dislike?DUPONT:Oh my goodness. Well, I think that they would understand, first off, that the electors no longer make choices. This is kind of a subtle change, but it\u2019s far-reaching in its implications, because the electors now actually just serve no purpose.What they do actually do is to provide openings for fraud, because they\u2019re human beings. So I think (the founders) would be disturbed about that.And I should also point out with respect to that \u2014 they don\u2019t make a choice \u2014 they\u2019re actually not allowed to make a choice, and that\u2019s because state statutes require them to honor the wishes of the voters in their state. They have to vote for the slate of candidates that the party that nominated them has put up, and that\u2019s been upheld by the Supreme Court.If you look atFederalist 68, when Hamilton is describing what he believes they created in the Electoral College, he talks about the electors being people of wisdom and discernment and experience, and people who are making a choice. Now that wisdom and discernment is forbidden. I think we have a problem with human electors who are vulnerable to corruption.In early presidential elections, many states did not let individual people voteWOLF:One of the things that blew me away reading the first few chapters of this is that people weren\u2019t voting for president in much of the country for much of US history.DUPONT:No South Carolinian ever cast a vote for president until after the Civil War, and no New Yorker did until 1828. The states, the legislatures could make that choice, and the more competitive an election got, the more likely they were to take the choice away from the people and take it to themselves.The classic example is the election of 1800, when 10 out of the 16 states, the state legislatures chose the electors.Many states did not award all of their votes to the same candidate. That\u2019s not necessarily betterWOLF:The other thing I was really interested in is this fight over \u201cdistrict\u201d versus \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d voting. Some states used to use a district method and divide up their electoral votes. Except for Maine and Nebraska, today every state is winner-take-all. And an effort to end the district method in Nebraska failed this year. Would it be better now if we were in a district system?DUPONT:Yes and no. What I think that the argument between a district versus winner-take-all really underscores is the fact that this is an algorithm. Changing from a state or winner-take-all to a district system would just move where the parentheses go, and it would import the problem of gerrymandering into the presidential election. How those district lines were drawn would become really, really important.(Thomas) Jefferson and (James) Madison \u2014 and actually a lot of people who wanted to reform the Electoral College in the early days \u2014 did want the district system, and Madison said that that was what the framers had mostly in mind when they designed it.But I really think the reason that they argue for the district system, as opposed to abolishing the Electoral College outright in those years, is the three-fifths bump that the slave states got.(Note: The Constitution, as originally written, counted the enslaved as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of apportioning House seats and taxation.)Of course, Jefferson and Madison\u2019s party was absolutely dependent on that three-fifths bump, because the strength of their party was in the South, in the slave-holding states. So I don\u2019t think it would be better. If we were going to do something about the Electoral College, why not just go for broke and get a system where every vote is equal, where we vote directly for our chief executive?The founders\u2019 main reason for opposing the national popular vote has literally disappearedWOLF:There are people trying to kind of end-run around the Constitution with things like theNational Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which wouldn\u2019t require changing the Constitution but would impose a popular-vote model of sorts. Unlike the Electoral College, a national popular vote is something that the founders specifically rejected.DUPONT:If youwant to be technical, yes, they did consider it twice and vote against it twice. But what I want to say to qualify that is that they didn\u2019t all reject it.For example, James Madison, who\u2019s really kind of leading this discussion throughout the (Constitutional) Convention, he advocates for it. He says twice that he thinks that\u2019s the best choice.Gouverneur Morris \u2014 and I always like to remind people that\u2019s not a misspelling of Governor; it\u2019s Gouverneur. Gouverneur Morris, who I think most Americans don\u2019t really know much about \u2026 wrote the final draft, the language of the Constitution, and he\u2019s really one of the key delegates there in Philadelphia. He advocated quite eloquently for a national popular vote. I think that that gets left out of the conversation.There were several small state delegates that wanted a national popular vote. But in addition to that, I think the reasons why they rejected it are important.Those who rejected it just didn\u2019t think that ordinary people had access to the information. The belief was that the way you would know the character of an individual is if you had served with them in the legislature or in your state legislature. And there were very few Americans at the time who had national reputations. George Washington and maybe Benjamin Franklin, but really no one beyond that.So they think that the choice needs to be in the hands of people who would know \u2014 and I would also note that eight of the 13 original state legislatures chose their governors this way, and the other five, it was kind of a combination of methods.So it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s not as if the idea of directly electing the chief executive has got much currency at the time.We have maybe the opposite problem now. We have too much information about national characters. So I think the reason that some of them didn\u2019t like it, that reason has disappeared.Side note: One forgotten founder was also a libertineWOLF:Just to go back to Gouverneur Morris \u2013\u2014you paint an interesting picture of him. I wanted to read more about him after reading your book. What I came away with is that he\u2019s this peg-legged ladies\u2019 man.DUPONT:Yeah, he just fascinates me. There are two good biographies of him. There\u2019s also a very poor one.But if you\u2019re interested, there\u2019s also an article \u2014 you might not want to put this in your article \u2014 but it\u2019s in the Journal of the History of Sexuality, about his sexual escapades when he is the US envoy to Paris, to France. It\u2019s just quite entertaining to check that out.(Note: Morris was enmeshed with European libertines. It is, indeed,entertaining to check out.)There have been many efforts to end the Electoral CollegeWOLF:You write about various efforts to end or reform the Electoral College, and there are more than I think people realize. Which one would you say got closest? I know the most recent would be the overwhelming vote in the House in 1969 to ditch the Electoral College in favor of an amendment to switch to a national popular vote. But you write about efforts that came close at the outset of the country.DUPONT:What I would note about the 1969 amendment \u2014 and that\u2019s the only one that would have abolished the Electoral College, at least the only one that passed either (chamber of Congress), and it passed the House with 83% of the vote.I find that astounding. That there was that much agreement in the House and it \u2026 I don\u2019t know what its fate would have been in the Senate, but it never got to a vote in the Senate because Strom Thurmond and two other Southern segregationistsfilibustered it.The November election could rekindle this debate if Trump or Harris gets more votes and loses the White HouseWOLF:Depending on what happens in November, it could be the third time in 25 years that more people vote for the losing candidate.DUPONT:That\u2019s right, and that\u2019s the way to say it too, because what this system does is allow the candidate who lost confidence of the American people to occupy the White House. And that seems very problematic to me.WOLF:If they called a constitutional convention of one and gave you a magic wand, what would you do?DUPONT:Well, I would phone a friend. No, to me, what we need is a national popular vote where every vote is equal. That\u2019s really the problem with the Electoral College \u2014 it distorts our votes so that some weigh more than others. It\u2019s institutionalized political inequality.Now, if I had the magic wand, I would probably want to, at the same time, reform the primary system. There was a proposal during Reconstruction that I thought made so much sense.One of the radical Republicans from Ohio,James Ashley\u2014 he wanted to have a national primary in April. This would be an open primary, and it would winnow the field of candidates. And then you would have a runoff or a general election in November. To me, that seems something on that order, because our primary system is also a problem. And I think while we\u2019re trying to fix one, we ought to try to fix the other.There are millions of Republicans in blue states and Democrats in red statesWOLF:The obvious modern objection to a national popular vote is that campaigns would essentially get everybody to vote in Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas and New York, and everybody else would be ignored.DUPONT:I hear this all the time, and that\u2019s actually one of the misconceptions that I wanted to write the book to address. Because not everybody in California votes the same, or even in LA.So, 25% of Angelinos voted for Donald Trump, and in California, Donald Trump got more votes from California than any other state. He got 6 million votes there (in 2020). So this idea that one place, or even one or two places, is going to overpower the vote of the whole country, it really won\u2019t happen, because those places are actually very diverse.I think of Houston, which is the nation\u2019s fourth-largest city. It\u2019s almost 50-50 red and blue. So we\u2019ve got these myths out there that there\u2019s this big blue juggernaut on the coast. But it\u2019s kind of the logic of the Electoral College that is leading us to think that.New York City is another example here. So it\u2019s true that Manhattan is very, very blue, but Staten Island is red. Much of Long Island is red. I think the idea that some people deserve more weight because of where they live is an absurdity.What about small states?WOLF:To your point, it is possible that turnout is being depressed for Republicans in a blue state like California, because why bother? Similarly, more people will vote for Kamala Harris in Texas than in New York, presumably, by the same logic.How would you make the argument to Delaware or Wyoming, or Alaska, places that have three electoral votes but one congressman, maybe a million or fewer voters? Why should they support giving up some of their influence?DUPONT:It\u2019s not really clear that the Electoral College advantages the small states. Because, think about it, if you live in Wyoming, you vote for three electors. Now, you think you vote for a presidential candidate, but you are actually voting for three electors. And every Wyomingan votes for three electors, no matter how many vote. So 10 of them could vote, or half a million can vote, but they\u2019re each voting for three electors.But a person in California votes for 54 electors, and that\u2019s regardless of turnout as well. And so you can see that you have much less weight if you are from Wyoming or Delaware.And then the other thing I would say: Historically, proposals to end the Electoral College have come from representatives of the small states. Proposals for a national popular vote came from delegates from the small states at the Constitutional Convention. So it\u2019s kind of a myth that the small states are not going to accept this."}, {"title": "Obama, the \u2018hopey-changey guy,\u2019 tries to close the deal for Harris", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/11/politics/barack-obama-kamala-harris-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Exactly 16 years ago, an impossibly young-looking Barack Obama was barnstorming through Ohio on a bus tour, electrifying huge crowds and emphatically closing the deal on his thumping 2008 election victory.On another October night on Thursday, the 63-year-old ex-president was back on stage, with a vast American flag for a backdrop, trying to do for Kamala Harris what she\u2019s so far struggled to do herself \u2014 put away the 2024 election.The snowy haired Obama had swapped Ohio, which ceased to be a closely contested presidential state as soon as he left the White House, for this year\u2019s potentially decisive state, Pennsylvania. That the hope and change prophet of 2008 is still his party\u2019s most effective political orator four presidential elections later is an indictment of Democrats. But the urgency of his message in Pittsburgh told a more immediate story \u2014 his nemesis Donald Trump may be poised for an Oval Office return.cnnRelated articleAn emotional Obama makes his harshest case yet against Trump at Pittsburgh rally\u201cWe don\u2019t need four more years of arrogance and bumbling and bluster and division. America is ready to turn the page,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe are ready for a better story, one that helped us work together instead of turning against each other. Pennsylvania, we\u2019re ready for President Kamala Harris.\u201dSometimes, it takes a former president to provide the clarity of argument that a candidate embroiled in a bitter race can\u2019t make themselves. That happened before \u2013 in 2012 when Bill Clinton took Obama\u2019s woolly reelection pitch and created a rationale for voters weary of economic pain to send him back to the White House.Obama on Thursday painted a searing picture of Trump as a malicious, ridiculous and incompetent menace, while trying to weave a rhetorical case for voters who are feeling economically insecure to vote for Harris, who is part of an incumbent administration, nonetheless.\u201cI am the hopey changey guy so I understand people feeling frustrated, feeling we can do better,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhat I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, Pennsylvania. I don\u2019t understand that.\u201dDemocrats are beginning to worry about Harris\u2019 prospectsObama\u2019s impassioned appeal for Harris in a state that could doom her presidential hopes comes at a moment when Democrats are fretting that her early momentum after taking over the campaign from President Joe Biden has ebbed, leaving potentially the most critical general election in decades at best a toss-up with less than a month to go.\u201cHe\u2019s clear-eyed about how close this race is,\u201d a source familiar with Obama\u2019s remarks told CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche. The ex-president savagely mocked Trump, asking whether his successor had ever changed a tire or a diaper and condemning his single term and \u201cmean and ugly\u201d border policies.Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris walks to board Air Force Two as she departs for New York, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on October 7, 2024.Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersRelated articleDemocrats\u00a0grow\u00a0anxious as Election Day nearsObama\u2019s appearance, a full-circle moment since Harris knocked on doors for him in frigid Iowa before the 2008 caucuses, also had a far deeper, personal significance. The 44th and 45th presidents have waged a political feud for more than a decade, since Trump built the foundation of his populist movement on false claims that Obama was not US-born. Birtherism was the earliest indication of the potency of Trump\u2019s political cocktail of racial aspersions and untruths, which has reached new heights in the 2024 election.More broadly, the antagonism between Obama and Trump helps explain the politics of the last 15 years in the United States.The 44th president heralded a new, multi-racial, young and socially diverse Democratic coalition as he built a brand as a leader seeking, at least rhetorically, to surmount some of the nation\u2019s deepest divides. Trump fashioned backlash politics in the wake of the nation\u2019s first Black presidency, using racial appeals and a strongman\u2019s zeal for demonizing opponents to create a political movement as enduring as Obama\u2019s. In many ways, the coming election represents a fresh battle between these two creeds \u2014 and Obama\u2019s legacy, including his signature Affordable Care Act, may depend on Harris winning.Obama slams Trump over false hurricane conspiracy theoriesThe former president on Thursday accused Trump of violating basic American values. \u201cThose didn\u2019t used to be Republican and Democratic values. It used to be we\u2019d have arguments about tax policy and foreign policy, but we didn\u2019t have arguments about whether you should tell the truth or not,\u201d he said.Video Ad Feedback'When did that become okay?\u2019: Obama calls out Trump's hurricane lies03:25- Source:CNNHe slammed Trump over his false claims that the Biden administration denied hurricane aid to Republicans. \u201cYou are going to have leaders who try to help and then you have a guy who will just lie about it to score political points and this has consequences,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhen did that become OK?\u201dBut the Trump campaign is not letting go of claims that were debunked even by many Republican state and local officials. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of people who could have been helped, a lot of lives that could have been saved, that weren\u2019t, and there\u2019s a lot of details to figure out,\u201d Sen. JD Vance, the GOP vice presidential nominee, said Thursday.An emerging strategy for Harris in the election endgameObama\u2019s remarks were directed especially at traditional Republicans who may abhor Trump\u2019s conduct and the male voters who form his power base.Earlier, Obama had sought to shore up another traditionally Democratic constituency \u2014 Black men, CNN\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere reported. At a Harris campaign office, Obama wondered whether the reticence of some \u201cbrothers\u201d to support the Democratic nominee came down to sexism. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that\u2019s a sign of strength, because that\u2019s what being a man is? Putting women down?\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s not acceptable.\u201dYet the former president can only do so much. He\u2019s not on the ballot and for all his undimmed appeal to Democrats, he\u2019s yesterday\u2019s man. And in the past, his quintessential appeal has not always been transferable to other Democrats. He worked hard to elect Hillary Clinton, who was defeated in 2016. One big question now is whether Harris, who has been basing her campaign on generational change and her biography, can build on Obama\u2019s critiques of Trump to make her own sharpened closing argument.People hold signs as former President Barack Obama speaks during a campaign event in support of Vice President Kamala Harris in Pittsburgh on October 10, 2024.Quinn Glabicki/ReutersThe former president\u2019s appearance came after a week in which the Harris campaign has stepped up its efforts to find and turn out any available voters. The vice president has been far more willing to enter unscripted situations \u2014 from a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, to an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d which is popular among women, to a trip to Howard Stern\u2019s radio show, a favorite of many American men. On Thursday, Harris was seeking to reverse some of Trump\u2019s success among another traditionally Democratic voting bloc, Hispanic voters, at a town hall hosted by Univision in Nevada, which she followed with a rally in Arizona.Democrats are trying to boost their prospects in swing states by clipping Trump\u2019s margins in rural areas where he runs strongest. The effort will get a boost next week when another former president,Bill Clinton, takes to the trail on Harris\u2019 behalf, recreating the intimate small-scale events that predated his 1992 presidential campaign. The 42nd president will get the chance to deploy his southerner\u2019s affinity for connecting with rural voters with relatable economic arguments.But Democratic concerns about Harris\u2019 campaign are palpable. There is no clear leader in CNN\u2019s average of recent national polls, swing state polling shows dead heats, and several surveys this week have suggested that the Democratic nominee\u2019s vital Blue Wall in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania could be wobbling.Former President Bill Clinton speaks at the DNC on Wednesday, August 21, in Chicago.Rebecca Wright/CNNRelated articleBill Clinton to hit battleground states for HarrisHarris has also apparently not yet settled on a way to differentiate herself from the Biden administration\u2019s unpopularity with many voters \u2014 especially those frustrated with high grocery prices. On \u201cThe View,\u201d for instance, Harris said, \u201cThere is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of\u201d what she would have done differently from the president over the past four years.But for all the anxiety among Democrats \u2014 rooted in the fear of what Trump would do in a second term he has promised to devote to \u201cretribution\u201d \u2014 the race remains impossible to predict as mid-October approaches. One reason why is that a flurry of massive, shocking events \u2014 including Biden\u2019s withdrawal and two assassination attempts that Trump survived \u2014 did not seem to give either Democrats or Republicans an advantage in a deeply divided nation. So it\u2019s questionable whether former presidents or the aftermath of hurricanes will change things at this late date.Adding to the uncertainty are questions about the exact shape of the likely electorate. Will Trump succeed in turning out lots of voters who don\u2019t usually engage? Or will the vice president benefit from a huge showing among female voters enraged by Trump\u2019s role in the overturning of a federal right to an abortion? Or could Harris\u2019 historic potential to become the first Black, female president spike turnout among Black women in swing states like Georgia?And will Trump\u2019s apparentlycasual attitude toward a traditional ground gameto maximize voter participation backfire?Obama stressed on Thursday that there was only one remedy for such intangibles.\u201cWhether this election is making you feel excited or scared or hopeful or frustrated or anything in between, do not just sit back and hope for the best,\u201d he told the Pittsburgh crowd. \u201cGet off your couch and vote.

Transgender rights might not be the issue a majority of voters are citing as important, but it is the issue on which former President Donald Trump\u2019s allies are focusing many of their ad dollars as theyattack Vice President Kamala Harrisin the final month of campaigning.What\u2019s driving voters instead?Voters are most focused on the economy, with 52% of registered voters, driven by Republicans and Republican leaners, citing the economy as \u201cextremely important\u201d to their vote.

He said Trump\u2019s plan to vastly increase oil production is the answer because it would bring more energy production and manufacturing jobs to the US.The Democratic vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, was ineffective at drawing the obvious contrast \u2013 that the Inflation Reduction Act passed by Democrats is already meant to kickstart American manufacturing with a pivot to a greener economy.Harris\u2019 flip on frackingHarris, meanwhile, has gone to great lengths to express that she does now support the practice of fracking, which climate activists oppose but which is important to the economy in the key state of Pennsylvania. In aninterview with CNN in August, Harris argued the country can address the climate crisis without ending the practice of fracking.\u201cWhat I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, explaining her new position.Still, admitting there is a climate crisis is a much different thing than refusing to say the words. In that recent Gallup polling, Harris had a 26 percentage point advantage over Trump when voters were asked who would do a better job addressing climate change. It was the largest spread in the poll. Trump\u2019s advantage over Harris on his best issues, the economy and immigration, for instance, was 9 percentage points. Those are smaller advantages on issues that appear to be driving more voters."}, {"title": "The great political battle over Hurricane Milton didn\u2019t wait for the storm to land", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/09/politics/trump-harris-hurricane-politics-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Long before the outer bands ofHurricane Miltonlashed the Florida coast, a political battle over the massive storm was already raging.A potential natural disaster of such magnitude \u2014 this may be the gargantuan climate-change fueled monster that scientists have long feared \u2014 ought to be immune from political opportunism.But in the final weeks of a presidential election featuring a candidate as unrelenting asDonald Trump, nothing escapes partisanship and Milton\u2019s aftermath may prove to be the next opening for the ex-president\u2019s maelstrom of misinformation.Usually, political shocks caused by hurricanes only unfold when the gale force winds have passed. This time, partly because Trump pushed so hard to exploit last week\u2019s Hurricane Helene for his political gain, the sparring has started early.ForVice President Kamala Harris, the storm offers a perilous spotlight, which could allow her to show she can master the media moment in a presidential context. It could showcase her capacity to express empathy for victims and her command of the federal government machine. But any failures of the federal rescue and relief effort after the storm is expected to roar ashore on late Wednesday or early Thursday could haunt her before next month\u2019s election. Harris\u2019 test will be complicated by the likelihood that even if the federal effort goes well, Trump is sure to fabricate a story implicating her in failure.This explains why the Democratic nominee tried to get out in front of Trump, and the storm, by telling reporters on Monday evening that the former president was pushing out misinformation about government aid. \u201cIt\u2019s about him, it\u2019s not about you.\u201d The vice president doubled down on Tuesday, telling ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d that \u201cthis is not an issue that is about partisanship or politics for certain leaders, but maybe is for others.\u201dGovernment officials reinforced the vice president\u2019s message on Tuesday. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell warned on \u201cCNN News Central\u201d that Trump\u2019s rhetoric was putting fear into people that the government wouldn\u2019t help them. And the White House opened an account on Reddit, a social media platform, to identify and combat misinformation.President Joe Biden may be handling the last major national emergency of his term. A sense of urgency mounted Tuesday morning when he postponed a foreign trip to Germany and Angola. No president can afford to be abroad with a national emergency pending. Biden\u2019s first task is to fulfill his core presidential duty \u2014 keeping Americans safe. But with his foreign policy legacy likely to be besmirched by unresolved wars in the Middle East, he surely wants to avoid a domestic imbroglio that would also overshadow his final days in office \u2013 and could damage his chosen successor, Harris.A storm of this size could give Trump a political openingTrump has repeatedly shown there\u2019s no situation he will not try to leverage for political gain. He seized on Hurricane Helene to bolster his narrative of the Biden-Harris administration as an incompetent rabble, unable to meet the basic needs of the American people. It\u2019s the same way he\u2019s accused Harris of complicity in a national crisis that he claims is marked by crime and rampant immigration and is on a glide path to World War III. Trump\u2019s critique is a caricature. While the country has problems \u2013 grocery prices remain stubbornly high and the asylum system is overwhelmed \u2013 he\u2019s creating a classic alternative reality for his fans and the conservative media echo chamber.Video Ad FeedbackBiden responds to Trump's false claim about Hurricane Helene aid00:56- Source:CNNTrump used the same tactics during the Hurricane Helene drama, falsely accusing Democrats of ignoring Republican areas. The ex-president wrongly said that Biden was ignoring calls from Georgia GOP Gov. Brian Kemp. He also claimed, falsely, that Harris had busted the Federal Emergency Management Agency budget to house undocumented migrants and could therefore not help victims of the storm. And Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, misled the country by claiming that the federal government was only offering $750 in aid to citizens who lost their homes. Some of Trump\u2019s claims were debunked by Republican leaders in Georgia and Tennessee. But from Trump\u2019s point of view, it doesn\u2019t matter whether his claims are nonsense. It\u2019s all about making inroads with voters who may not know nuances of the federal relief effort but might take away an unflattering portrayal of Harris.Trump argues that both Harris and Biden are mentality deficient and not up to the job of president. He\u2019s denied Democratic claims that he\u2019s politicizing hurricane season after rushing to battleground North Carolina to make false claims about the administration\u2019s incompetence. \u201cAnything I do, they\u2019ll say, oh, it\u2019s political,\u201d the ex-president told Laura Ingraham on Fox on Monday. \u201cIf I do anything good, no matter what I do, they\u2019ll say, oh, he did it for politics. I mean, they could have gotten there way before me.\u201d Trump\u2019s own haphazard leadership after hurricanes could also come back to haunt him.The Harris campaign on Monday sought to revive memories of his checkered disaster management record,debuting an adfeaturing two former Trump administration officials, Olivia Troye and Kevin Carroll, claiming that the former president once tried to withhold disaster relief funds from Democratic states.And Harris seized on the approaching storm as a prism to criticize Trump\u2019s character and to push her argument that he\u2019s an \u201cunserious man\u201d who poses a great threat if he\u2019s elected again. On ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d on Tuesday, she accused him of putting himself \u201cbefore the needs of others.\u201d Harris added: \u201cI fear that he really lacks empathy on a very basic level to care about the suffering of other people and then understand the role of a leader is not to beat people down, it\u2019s to lift people up especially in a time of crisis.\u201dStill, Trump\u2019s maneuvering is the latest sign of one advantage he holds over Harris despite having a presidential record of his own to defend \u2014 as a non-incumbent, he has the luxury of criticizing the administration\u2019s performance while bearing no personal responsibility.The legacies that shape storm politicsStorm politics are shaped by memories of two disasters. The botched handling of Hurricane Katrina, which slammed New Orleans and the Gulf coast in 2005, helped destroy President George W. Bush\u2019s second term. And President Barack Obama\u2019s more assured management of Superstorm Sandy, a hurricane that hit the East Coast in 2012, helped him put away Republican Mitt Romney in that year\u2019s election. Sandy is mostly remembered for then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s embrace of Obama as he sought maximum federal aid for his state. This angered many Republicans. And Christie was followed during his subsequent GOP presidential campaigns by his decision to put his duty before politics.One key political player who is unlikely to make the same choice is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who may have future national political ambitions following his failed run for the 2024 Republican nomination. DeSantis faces a similar dilemma to Christie \u2014 a need to work seamlessly with a Democratic administration for the good of his state despite his disdain for the president and vice president. And his future political considerations could probably not bear a failed relief effort any more than Harris\u2019 could. Like Harris, DeSantis started playing hurricane politics long before Milton arrived. A White House official told CNN that he had refused her calls about the hurricane \u2014 a claim that he denied but that didn\u2019t spare him a rebuke from the vice president.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis gets a tour from Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie while talking about the heavy machinery staging area at the Florida Horse Park in Ocala, Florida, on October 8, 2024, before a press conference about the impact that Hurricane Milton will have on the state of Florida.Doug Engle/Ocala Star-Banner/USA Today Network/ImagnDeSantis set off on a political path that requires dealing with Biden, the lame duck, but doing nothing to boost Harris in a way that could earn the wrath of Trump. \u201cShe is being selfish by trying to blunder into this when we\u2019re working just fine,\u201d DeSantis said on Monday evening. \u201cI\u2019ve had storms under both President Trump and President Biden, and I\u2019ve worked well with both of them. She\u2019s the first one who\u2019s trying to politicize the storm, and she\u2019s doing that just because of her campaign. She\u2019s trying to get some type of an edge,\u201d the Florida Republican complained.Unlike Harris, Biden had kinder words for DeSantis, saying on Tuesday that the governor had been \u201ccooperative.\u201d\u201cI said no, \u2018You\u2019re doing a great job, it\u2019s all being done well, we thank you for it,\u2019\u201d Biden said.But the president also took out a political insurance policy against any future complaints that the Florida Republican did not get what he wants from the White House. \u201cI literally gave him my personal phone number to call,\u201d Biden said."}, {"title": "The unexpected gender dynamic shaping the 2024 election", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/politics/trump-women-protector-gender-divide-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014All signs suggest that the partisan divide over changing gender roles in society could widen even further in the 2024 election, adding a new source of uncertainty to a contest already on a knife\u2019s edge.Donald Trump\u2019srecent declaration to female voters that\u201cI will be your protector\u201doffered the latest demonstration of the former president\u2019s determination to consolidate the voters most committed to traditional gender roles and family structures \u2013 a culturally conservative group that includes not only many men but also a large number of women.In the process, though, political strategists in both parties believe the GOP nominee risks further alienating the broad array of voters who are comfortable with the social changes that have challenged those traditional patterns of family life, especially women. Younger, college-educated and single women are likely to be particularly resistant to the idea that they need protecting by any man \u2013 much less one in Trump, who has been foundliable for sexual abusein a New York civil case and who faces specific allegations of sexual misconduct from dozens of other women.Video Ad Feedback'So disgusting': Analyst reacts to Trump calling himself 'protector' of women01:51- Source:CNNFor most women voters, the idea that they need protection by a man would be \u201cclumsy and dated and just irrelevant\u2026from anybody,\u201d said Republican pollster Christine Matthews. \u201cBut from him in particular, it\u2019s cringiest.\u201dTrump\u2019s pledge to protect women offered a kind of Rosetta Stone for how his campaign hopes to reduce his deficit with female voters to Vice President Kamala Harris, who leads among them by double-digits in most national and swing state polls. \u201cYou will no longer be abandoned, lonely or scared. You will no longer be in danger. \u2026 You will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems our country has today,\u201d Trump insisted at a Pennsylvania campaign rally last week. \u201cYou will be protected, and I will be your protector. Women will be healthy, happy, confident and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion.\u201dIn one sense, Trump has a favorable backdrop for this argument, noted Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Polls, Cox said, generally show that women do feel more anxiety about their lives \u2013 and the position of women in American society \u2013 than they did a few years ago. Trump is hoping to focus that anxiety on physical security \u2013 especially the threats he says women face from crime and undocumented immigrants.As Matthews noted, this is similar to the arguments Trump aimed at women during his reelection campaign in the summer of 2020. At that point, he argued that Joe Biden and Democrats would threaten the physical security ofwhat he called\u201cthe Suburban Housewives of America\u201d by forcing their neighborhoods to accept more low-income housing that implicitly would be filled with non-White families. To underscore the point, Republicans gave a prominent speaking role at the GOP convention that summer to a White couple from suburban St. Louis who faced criminal charges after brandishing guns at Black Lives Matter protesters marching past their house.The problem Trump faces in emphasizing physical security, both Cox and Matthews agreed, is that the heightened anxiety evident in polls among women is driven by a different set of concerns \u2013 about which many see Trump not as the solution, but as the problem.\u201cThere is this growing sense of anxiety among a lot of women, single women, about their rights, their freedoms, the opportunities they will have in American society,\u201d said Cox. \u201cIt is a little ironic that Trump is using this language because a lot of those same people would point their finger directly at him for making the lives of single women more difficult.\u201dIt was revealing that in his remarks last week, Trump insisted that women would feel so safe they \u201cwill no longer be thinking about abortion.\u201d That was an implicit acknowledgement ofhow many female voters remainoutraged by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision that overturned the constitutional right to the procedure. And that may prove an insuperable barrier for Trump even among some of the women who say in polls that they trust him more than Harris to handle crime and immigration.\u201cMany women feel\u00a0Dobbs,and by extension the former President, has put women\u2019s lives at risk and heightened their anxieties about women\u2019s rights,\u201d Erin Cassese, a University of Delaware political scientist who studies gender and politics, said in an email. \u201cBut the President went on to tell women not to be worried about reproductive rights. It probably came across as dismissive of their concerns.\u201dAbortion rights supporters stage a counter protest during the 50th annual March for Life rally on the National Mall on January 20, 2023, in Washington, DC.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesAs revealing as Trump\u2019s emphasis on physical security was the openly paternalistic language in which he delivered his pledge. That was only the latest example of his campaign signaling its support for traditional gender roles. At the GOP convention in July, Trump surrounded himself with symbols of hyper-masculinity such as pro-wrestler Hulk Hogan and Ultimate Fighting Championship President and CEO Dana White,who has been caught on video publicly hitting his wife.\u00a0Vice presidential nominee JD Vance has repeatedly championed family arrangements in which women focus on childbearing through his derision of \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d and his musing that parents should receive extra votes to cast on behalf of their children.\u201cThe messaging on gender coming out of the campaign broadly is very much about reaffirming traditional roles for women and for men,\u201d Cassese said.To an extent that is not often discussed, attitudes toward those traditional roles now separate the two parties\u2019 voters in an era when culture not class has become the principal glue binding each side\u2019s coalition.\u201cTrump\u2019s assertion that he is \u2018a protector\u2019 of women taps conservative conceptions of hierarchical gender roles in which men are protectors and providers who exercise power in the public sphere while women are nurturers and caregivers whose proper place is in the private domestic world,\u201d said Robert P. Jones, president and founder of the Public Religion Research Institute, a non-profit organization that studies US attitudes toward cultural change.Those attitudes are evident in a wide array of polls in recent years that have found most Republicans \u2013 including not only a significant majority of GOP men but even a substantial share of GOP women \u2013 to be resistant to rethinking traditional views of gender roles at home and in the workplace.In polling earlier this year, for instance, the non-partisan Pew Research Center found that 83% of Trump-supporting men and 55% of his female supporters say the obstacles that inhibited women from advancing in US society are now \u201clargely gone.\u201d Over 60% of Trump-backing men and 54% of his female supporters agreed that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority.\u201d Nearly half of the Trump men and about 3-in-10 of the Trump women even said they were uncomfortable with women who do not take their husband\u2019s last name after marriage.In a national AEI survey released last week, 60% of Republican men and about 40% of Republican women said women asking for equal treatment are really seeking \u201cspecial favors.\u201d Most Republican men and women also agreed that society no longer needs to do more to ensure equal rights for women.In a survey last year, Politico and Ipsos found that a majority of both Republican men and women agreed that, \u201cTraditional family structures, with a wage-earning father and homemaking mother, best equip children to succeed.\u201dPolling by Tresa Undem, who conducts surveys for progressive groups, has likewise found that big majorities of Republicans agree that \u201cwomen are too easily offended\u201d; that \u201cmost women interpret innocent remarks or acts as being sexist\u201d; and that \u201cthese days society seems to punish men just for acting like men.\u201d Most Republican women agreed with those sentiments as well.In PRRI polling this year, nearly half of Republicans agreed with two absolutist statements about gender roles. The first: \u201cIn a truly Christian family, the husband is the head of the household and his wife submits to his leadership.\u201d The second: \u201cSociety is better off when men and women stick to the jobs and tasks they are naturally suited for.\u201d In each case, about 4-in-10 Republican women agreed with those sentiments.Across all these questions, evangelical Christians are often the most supportive of these conservative views about the proper role of women. In the PRRI polling, for instance, about three-fifths of evangelical Christians agreed with the statement that men are the head of the household in truly Christian families.\u201cOn the whole, most Republican and White evangelical women share their male counterparts\u2019 sentiments about gender essentialism, hierarchy, and defined social roles,\u201d said Jones.Trump\u2019s protector language offers yet another way in which he is signaling his sympathy for the world view of evangelical Christians. But those voters are already supporting him in overwhelming numbers and turning out at high rates.\ufeff \u201cIs there a sliver of white evangelical Trump-supporting women who might feel some comfort by this protector message? Maybe,\u201d Undem said in an email. \u201cBut that\u2019s not who Trump needs to get. Trump needs to get suburban women.\u201dKamala Harris waves as she boards Air Force Two departing San Francisco International Airport on September 28, 2024.Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty ImagesCox says that if there is an audience beyond evangelicals for Trump\u2019s argument, \u201cThe appeal is going to be most effective to married women, particularly those in more traditional social arrangements.\u201dCox said he sees Trump\u2019s \u201cprotector\u201d case as an extension of the symbols of traditional masculinity that the former president stressed at the GOP convention. \u201cIn very Trumpian fashion, it\u2019s a very unsubtle attempt to say you have real reason to be afraid for your physical safety\u2026and I\u2019ll be the one to be the hard a** here,\u201d Cox said. \u201cI will do the things that Democrats are too weak and ineffectual to do. That kind of message of very traditional masculine strength and directness \u2013 some voters will find that appealing.\u201dDemocratic pollster Celinda Lake believes some working-class White women, especially older ones, will respond to Trump\u2019s relentless insistence that undocumented immigrants threaten their safety, such as when he darkly declared in Wisconsin last weekend that such immigrants will \u201cwalk into your kitchen [and]\u2026.cut your throat.\u201d\u201cImmigration tied to safety is a concern, particularly for older, non-college, protection-oriented women,\u201d Lake said. \u201cThat reaches into independent and Democratic-leaning women.\u201d Many of the working-class White women most receptive to Trump\u2019s message on safety have also tended to prioritize economic over cultural concerns (like abortion or women\u2019s rights) and are open to him because they believe the cost of living was more affordable under his presidency, strategists note.Trump is presenting himself in a very conventional \u201cFather Knows Best\u201dkind of frame: the strong man who provides the protection that women need because they are inherently vulnerable. His problem is that most voters outside the core GOP coalition are generally comfortable with the changes in gender roles and family dynamics since the \u201cFather Knows Best\u201dera in the 1950s.In the PRRI polling, for instance, about 7-in-10 of all women and men who do not identify as Republicans rejected the idea that women should submit to their husbands in a Christian marriage, and three-fourths of non-Republican women (as well as two-thirds of non-Republican men) rejected the idea that society is better off when men and women stick to jobs they are \u201cnaturally suited for.\u201d In the Politico/Ipsos polling, only 1-in-4 independent women and 1-in-7 Democratic women agreed that \u201ctraditional family structures\u201d served kids best.The critical question for both sides is whether any gains for Trump among the blue-collar and older women drawn to his economic record and \u201cprotector\u201d messaging will be erased by a backlash among the single, college-educated, younger and Black women mostly repelled by that message and his overall record on women\u2019s rights. \u201cWhat older women hear as protection, those women hear as control,\u201d said Lake. \u201cAnd they sure as heck don\u2019t want to put Donald Trump in control of their lives.\u201dTrump\u2019s implication that women need protecting taps into the same emotions that have made abortion such a powerful issue for so many women, Undem said. Many women view the restrictions on abortion that the Supreme Court enabled \u2013 with Trump\u2019s nominees providing the pivotal votes \u2013 as a proxy for a broader attempt to reverse the increased freedom women have won over the past few generations. \u201cFor pro-choice suburban women, abortion is their number one issue\u2026.because of women\u2019s rights, health and safety, and autonomy,\u201d Undem wrote in her email. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s ironic. One of Trump\u2019s biggest weaknesses is that so many women want protection and autonomy from HIM literally as President! And [from] what he represents - the government taking control over their bodies and putting their lives at risk.\u201dMatthews is also skeptical that Trump will move many women voters not already leaning his way by fanning their fears of immigrant crime. \u201cTo me, this is not new,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is just a sort of rehash of what he tried in 2020. It strikes me as an arsonist who sets a fire and then says, \u2018I\u2019m the only one who can put the fire out.\u2019\u201dHarris is amassing big margins among all the groups of female voters most likely to recoil from Trump\u2019s insistence that they need protection. The latest Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics youth pollfound Harris leading Trump by 47 percentage points among young women \u2013 an advantage about half again as large as Biden\u2019s lead over Trump among young women in the institute\u2019s fall 2020 survey. State and national polls often find Harris leading Trump among college-educated White women by a bigger margin than Biden won them in 2020 (especially in the critical Rustbelt battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). And despite their own economic struggles, Black women continue to present a wall of overwhelming resistance to Trump.Harris will likely need to secure every last vote she can from women because polls suggest Trump could run even better than he did in 2020 among men. The GOP nominee may style himself as women\u2019s protector, but it is the women who see him as a threat to their rights and autonomy who may protect the Democratic hold on the White House."}, {"title": "How Harris could secure a historic winning record for Democrats in November\u00a0\u2013 and still lose", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/08/politics/democrats-popular-vote-kamala-harris-analysis/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014IfKamala Harriswins the popular vote in November, Democrats will do something no party has done since the formation of the modern party system nearly two centuries ago.But that might not benefit them very much when it comes to governing.If the vice president captures more votes thanformer President Donald Trump, it would be the eighth time in the past nine presidential elections that Democrats have won the national popular vote. That would establish a new record. Since the modern party system began in 1828, no party has won the popular vote over a nine presidential election sequence more than seven times. That has been accomplished twice: once by Republicans around the turn of the 20th century in a period defined most vividly by President Theodore Roosevelt, and then by Democrats in the decades after President Franklin D. Roosevelt realigned American politics with his \u201cNew Deal\u201d coalition during the Depression.Both the TR Republicans and the FDR Democrats indisputably dominated their eras, also maintaining control of Congress for years and lastingly setting the direction of national policy. By contrast, the modern day Democrats\u2019 historic success at winning the popular vote hasn\u2019t translated into nearly as much governing power for them.Over this record run of popular vote success, Democrats have already twice lost the Electoral College \u2013 and thus the White House \u2013 while winning more votes. They have achieved unified control of the presidency and Congress much more rarely than the TR Republicans or FDR Democrats. Those differences have spawned a third crucial divergence: compared to their two predecessors in popular vote dominance, today\u2019s Democrats have been able to name far fewer justices to the Supreme Court.\u201cIt\u00a0may be the most striking fact about recent American politics: that there is this long run of electoral triumph, at least in the popular vote, that doesn\u2019t seem to map onto actual governing power in the way that we might expect to see,\u201dsaid Paul Pierson, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley and co-author of the recent book \u201cPartisan Nation,\u201d on how hardening partisan polarization has changed American government and elections.Harris isn\u2019t guaranteed to capture the popular vote; Trump is running closer to her in most national polls than he did against Joe Biden at this point in 2020. And the seven key swing states are all so close that strategists in both parties see a real chance for Trump to win the Electoral College even if he loses the popular vote again, as he did in 2016. Even if Harris wins the White House,Democrats face very difficult odds of holding the Senate,where they are now clinging to a 51-49 majority.Former President Donald Trump arrives at a campaign rally at the Butler Farm Show on October 5, 2014, in Butler, Pennsylvania.Evan Vucci/APA Republican Senate (and maybe House) majority coupled with a Harris victory would make her the first Democratic president since Grover Cleveland won in 1884 to enter office without unified control of both congressional chambers, pointed out Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball election newsletter published by the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. That would severely limit the agenda a President Harris could pursue \u2013 potentially illuminating again how much more difficult it has been for the modern Democrats than their predecessors to translate popular vote success into the power to pass the agenda their coalition has repeatedly voted to support.Already, the disparity is glaring. The TR-era Republicans also held majorities in the House and Senate for 24 of the 28 years during which they controlled the White House. From FDR through LBJ, Democrats simultaneously controlled both chambers of Congress for 26 of the 28 years during which they held the White House. Those long periods of unified government control \u2013 each coalition at one point held the White House and Congress for 14 consecutive years \u2013 allowed the dominant party to systematically advance its agenda and fundamentally shape the nation\u2019s direction for a generation.The contrast in the Democrats\u2019 modern experience is stunning. Not only have they lost the White House twice while winning the popular vote in this period, but they have controlled both chambers of Congress for just six of the 20 years in which they have held the White House since 1992. (Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Biden each held unified control of Congress for just the first two years of their presidencies before losing it in the first mid-term election.) Amazingly,Republicanswon unified control of government in two elections when Democrats won a plurality of the national presidential vote: 2000 and 2016. The only previous time that happened was in 1888.\u201cRepublicans have a path to getting a majority of seats without a majority of votes,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at the centrist New America thinktank. \u201cIt is conceivable in this election that Republicans could lose the Senate vote, lose the presidential popular vote, lose the House popular majority vote, and still win control of all three chambers.\u201dWith their control of Congress much more fleeting, Democrats have been unable to implement nearly as much of their agenda as the earlier dominant coalitions did. The disparity is especially vivid on another key lever of government power: appointments to the Supreme Court. By the end of the era of Republican popular vote supremacy in 1932,GOP presidents had appointed seven of the nine members of the Supreme Court. When the FDR Democrats\u2019 long run of popular vote dominance ended in 1968,Democratic presidents had appointed five of the high court\u2019s nine members. And even that number understates the extent of Democratic influence during this period, because the court in 1968 included four justices appointed by Dwight Eisenhower; when Eisenhower entered office in 1953, FDR and Truman had appointedall nineSupreme Court members.Today, Democratic presidents have appointed only three of the Supreme Court\u2019s nine members. \u201cI think the framers would have a hard time getting their head around the idea that one political party had won the popular vote for the presidency in 7 of 8, or 8 of 9 elections, and the other party had 6 of the 9 seats on the Supreme Court,\u201d said Pierson.A Harris popular vote victory in November would match another milestone: It would mark the fifth consecutive election in which Democrats have won the popular vote, a feat previously achieved in the modern party era only by the Democrats behind Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman from 1932 through 1948.Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a rally at the Dort Financial Center in Flint, Michigan, on October 4, 2024.Mark Schiefelbein/APToday\u2019s Democrats have already set another record by winning the popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential elections; the previous high over an eight-election sequence was six, for Democrats from 1828 through 1856. But this year\u2019s result will be particularly important for historic comparisons because no party has ever maintained a consistent edge in the presidential popular vote for more than nine elections before another party started a run of its own.While the consistency of the Democratic popular vote advantage is unmatched, in other ways the party\u2019s edge looks more modest than its predecessors. That\u2019s one reason it has translated into less governing power.The Democrats\u2019 popular vote winning stretch began in 1992 with Clinton\u2019s victory over George H.W. Bush. Clinton again in 1996, Al Gore in 2000, Obama in 2008 and 2012, Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020 all then won the presidential popular vote. The only time since 1992 that Republicans won the popular vote was when George W. Bush attracted 50.7% in 2004.But in their seven popular vote victories since 1992, Democrats have crossed 50% of the vote just three times \u2013 in both of Obama\u2019s victories and Biden\u2019s win in 2020. The highest share of the popular vote Democrats have won over this period is the 52.9% that Obama garnered in 2008.Republicans assembled bigger majorities in their period of greatest dominance around the turn of the 20th century. The GOP\u2019s seven-of-nine popular vote run began when William McKinley won the presidency in 1896 and 1900, continued with Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s resounding 1904 win and William Howard Taft\u2019s win in 1908, and extended through the post World War I victories by Warren Harding (in 1920), Calvin Coolidge (1924) and Herbert Hoover (1928).Over these nine elections, the Republican presidential candidates exceeded 50% of the popular vote seven times, reached 58% twice, and peaked at 60.3% with Harding in 1920.The FDR-era Democrats were nearly as successful. In their seven popular vote victories over the nine elections from 1932-1968, Democrats reached 50% of the vote five times and exceeded 60% twice, peaking with Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s 61.1% landslide in 1964.The earlier majority coalitions also displayed more breadth of support in the Electoral College. In their seven popular vote victories, the TR-era Republicans won 71% of the available Electoral College votes; the FDR-era Democrats, in their seven popular vote victories, won 80% of the total Electoral College votes. In their seven popular vote victories since 1992, Democrats have won about 58% of the available Electoral College votes.Most importantly, Democrats over this period twice have won the popular vote and lost the Electoral College and the presidency \u2013 to Bush in 2000 and to Trump in 2016. Neither the TR-era Republicans nor the FDR-era Democrats lost the Electoral College in any presidential election when they won the popular vote; indeed, until 2000, such a divergence had happened only three times in over 200 years of American presidential elections. Now there is a real chance the presidential and Electoral College vote may diverge for the third time in the past 24 years.The lower ceiling for Democrats in both the popular and Electoral College votes largely reflects what political scientists John Sides, Lynn Vavreck and Michael Tesler have called the \u201ccalcification\u201d of American politics. In the earlier eras, elections more regularly featured big swings in allegiance and the ascendant party could sweep up a wide swathe of persuadable voters.Compared to the earlier periods, far more voters today are locked down, seemingly permanently. The result is that far more states have voted the same way in every election during this era of Democratic popular vote dominance than in the earlier periods.In the eight presidential elections since 1992, 15 states \u2013all part of what I dubbed \u201cthe blue wall\u201d\u2013 have now voted for the Democratic presidential nominee every time. Another 13 states have votedagainstthe Democrats in each of those elections; all 28 of those states are strongly favored to side with the same party again next month.This dwarfs the level of consistency in the earlier periods. Just seven states voted the same way in all nine elections during the Republican party\u2019s era of early 20th century dominance: Vermont for the GOP and six states from the old confederacy \u2013 at a time when most Southerners still \u201cvoted the way their daddy shot\u201d\u2013 against it.\u00a0(Three more states defected from the GOP nominee only in 1912 to support Roosevelt when he ran as a third-party candidate.)Democrats won only two former confederate states (Arkansas and North Carolina) in each election from 1932-1968 and no state voted against them in all nine of those campaigns. Through the 20th century, very close presidential elections may have been rare, Kondik noted, but \u201cwhen we did have them, a lot of the states were up for grabs.\u201dToday, with so many states cemented in their preferences, the opportunity for either side to win a resounding victory is greatly diminished.Yet even with all these limits, Democrats have amassed a winning streak in the presidential popular vote that in the past has yielded much more lasting control over the federal government and the nation\u2019s direction. And that points to the other key reason their popular vote dominance hasn\u2019t translated into more consistent governing power: how Republicans are now benefiting from the kinks in the constitutional system that favor smaller states with less population density.That small state bias shows up to some extent in the Electoral College since every state, no matter how big or small, receives a baseline of two electoral votes. But this tilt is felt most profoundly in the Senate where every state, regardless of population, receives the same two seats. As Republicans over the past few decades have grown more dominant in smaller states across the nation\u2019s interior, that\u2019s provided the GOP a huge advantage in the battle for Senate control.Drutmanhas calculatedthat if you assign half of each state\u2019s population to each senator, Senate Republicans have represented a majority of Americans onlyoncesince 1958 \u2013 and even then they had only 50.2% of the population as constituents in the 1997-1998 session. Yet since 1980, the GOP has held the Senate majority for slightly more than half the time; today, Democrats possess just a slim 51-49 seat majority even though they represent 58% of the nation\u2019s population.The structural GOP advantage in the Senate, combined with the party\u2019s growing willingness under outgoing GOP leader Mitch McConnell to use the filibuster, has left Democrats facing \u201ca lot more limits\u201d than the earlier coalitions on what they \u201chave been able to do despite those popular vote majorities,\u201d Drutman said.The House bias toward smaller places isn\u2019t as serious as the Senate\u2019s, but even there, Republicans have benefited because Democrats\u2019 votes are overly concentrated in large metropolitan areas \u2013 a process intensified by aggressive gerrymandering in many red states. In contrast to presidential elections,Republicans have often won the total national popular vote in House elections since 1992, but the share of seats they have won in the chamber has repeatedly exceeded their share of the overall vote.At various points during this long dry spell in the presidential popular vote, some voices in the GOP have raised alarms about the trend.That happened in the celebrated party \u201cautopsy\u201d report after Mitt Romney\u2019s loss to Obama in 2012; Nikki Haley raised concerns again about the persistent popular vote shortfalls during her unsuccessful bid for the GOP nomination this year.But these alarms have failed to find much traction in the party. Trump in 2016 turned the autopsy\u2019s principal message on its head by focusing not on reaching out to non-White and moderate voters, but by centering his campaign on mobilizing more culturally conservative and economically populist blue-collar Whites. Even now, most Republicans appear unconcerned about the possibility (if not probability) that Trump could lose the popular vote for a third time, if his potential gains since 2020 among non-White voters are eclipsed by losses among well-educated, formerly GOP-leaning, suburbanites.While repeatedly losing the popular vote is a problem \u201cat least symbolically,\u201d said Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini, \u201cI think most in the party have acquiesced to the reality that Trump has a ceiling at something like 47% but is extremely well-optimized for the Electoral College, so the most likely win scenario (for him) is one without the popular vote.\u201dIf anything, it is Democrats who have displayed more concern about the modern pattern of election results. Many party centrists have argued that despite the party\u2019s unprecedented run of wins in the presidential popular vote, its struggles in the Electoral College and the Senate show that \u201cthe Democratic Party has to be able to be competitive in more places; it has to connect with more people in different places,\u201d as Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic group, put it.That kind of self-criticism is much rarer in the Trump-era GOP. Pierson and Drutman both note that the GOP\u2019s ability to repeatedly win both the White House and either congressional chamber despite reliably losing the presidential popular vote has short-circuited what is supposed to be one of the self-correcting mechanisms of the American political system.Usually, Pierson pointed out, when a party repeatedly loses the popular vote, it shifts direction \u2013 as Democrats did in Clinton\u2019s move to the center following the party\u2019s three blow-out losses to Reagan and H.W. Bush in the 1980s. But the Trump-era Republicans haven\u2019t had much incentive to rethink their direction because they \u201chave not paid a big price in terms of their ability to exercise authority,\u201d Pierson said. \u201cIf you are not paying a price for it, why not keep doing what you are doing or try to intensify the parts of the political system that allow minorities to prevail over majorities\u201d such as gerrymandering or the filibuster?Ruffini countered that even with another potential popular vote loss, it would not be fair to describe the GOP as the minority party if it wins the electoral vote and at least one chamber of Congress. \u201cEveryone competes under the same rules,\u201d he said, \u201cand the system is optimized for narrow wins, which in the Electoral College and the Senate might mean non-majority wins.\u201dBut if Trump loses both the popular and electoral vote at a time when so many Americans are dissatisfied with Biden\u2019s performance and the nation\u2019s direction, \u201cthen I think there will be a moment of reckoning,\u201d said Ruffini, author of the recent book \u201cParty of The People\u201d about the GOP\u2019s changing coalition. \u201cThat\u2019ll be a serious problem, far more serious than when they wrote the autopsy in 2012, when we were going up against a generational political talent in Barack Obama. It would call\u00a0into question the ability to do the most basic things at a national level.\u201dConversely, if Trump again wins the electoral vote while failing in the popular vote, the losers would include not only Harris and Democrats but also the bedrock civics book assumption that in American democracy, majorities rule."}, {"title": "Make your own predictions for who will win the White House", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/electoral-college-map?game-id=2024-PG-CNN-ratings&game-view=map", "content": ""}, {"title": "Get all the important election dates you need to know", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/calendar", "content": ""}, {"title": "Here\u2019s a breakdown of all the 2024 presidential candidates", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/politics/presidential-candidates-dg/?index.html", "content": ""}, {"title": "Voter Handbook: Find out what the rules are, where you are", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/politics/election-voter-handbook-dg/", "content": ""}, {"title": "How hurricane season is affecting the way Americans follow\u00a0the Trump-Harris race", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/breakthrough-polling-projects-hurricanes-trump-harris/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014With the election less than a month away, the public\u2019s attention has shifted to the candidates\u2019 responses to\u00a0hurricane season,according to The Breakthrough, a CNN polling project that tracks what average Americans are actually hearing, reading and seeing about the presidential nominees throughout the campaign. FormerPresident Donald Trump\u2019s campaign also faced renewed focus on his legal troubles in the wake of a new filing by federal prosecutors, the survey finds.In the wake ofHurricane Helene, which has killed more than 230 people across the southeastern United States,\u00a0\u201churricane\u201d was the word most frequently mentioned when respondents were asked what they\u2019d heard about Trump. It was\u00a0the second-most frequent word mentioned when they were asked about Vice President Kamala Harris, second only to \u201ccampaign.\u201d The poll, conducted by SSRS and Verasight on behalf of a research team from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, was fielded from\u00a0October 4-7, beforeHurricane Miltonmade landfall in Florida on Wednesday night.Democrats and Republicans were about equally likely to mention the hurricane when talking about Harris \u2013 although their perspectives on her response often differed sharply.Harris \u201cwas working with FEMA on providing assistance and recovery for the areas affected by Hurricane Helene,\u201d one Democratic respondent wrote, while another credited her with having done \u201ca great job of consoling hurricane victims in Georgia.\u201dBy contrast, a Republican respondent wrote about hearing that\u00a0Harris \u201cis only paying $750 to those whose homes are being devastated in the hurricanes, yet sending billions upon billions of dollars to Ukraine and Israel.\u201d The $750 is an apparent reference to a payment program at the Federal Emergency Management Agencythat has been mischaracterized by Trump and othersas the only assistance FEMA is providing.Republicans were far likelier than Democrats to mention the hurricane in conjunction with Trump. When Democrats were asked what they\u2019d recently heard about the GOP presidential\u00a0nominee, they were more likely than Republicans to mention his response to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, or simply use the word \u201clie.\u201dIn the latest set of data, Americans also mentioned the October 5 rally Trump held in Butler, Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the first assassination attempt against him this summer. And they referenced two other names in conjunction with him: Elon Musk, whoappeared onstage with Trump\u00a0in Butler,\u00a0and Jack Smith, the special counsel whoserecently unsealed legal brieflaid out the government\u2019s sweeping case against the former president\u00a0for his effort to overturn the 2020 election.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgRoughly 14% of respondents who\u2019d heard something about Trump\u00a0referenced words related to his\u00a0legal issues, up from 7% in the previous wave of data and the highest share to do so since early September, when the sentencing in his New York criminal case was delayed until after the 2024 election.Asked about Harris, 8% of respondents who\u2019d heard something about her\u00a0mentioned words relating to endorsements \u2013 in this case, largely a reference to Republican former Vice President Dick Cheney, who announced his support of her last month, and his daughter Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman\u00a0whorecently appeared with Harrison the campaign trail. Harris also previously saw bursts of attention after endorsements from Oprah Winfrey and Taylor Swift.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgThe sentiment behind the words Americans used to describe what they\u2019d heard about Harris remained modestly more positive than the words they used to describe the news about Trump. This doesn\u2019t mean that they expressed warmer feelings about Harris personally but that what they said about her tended to be framed in relatively positive terms and tone.

About 8% in the latest data use the word \u201clie\u201d or \u201cliar\u201d in relation to Trump. That figure has frequently been in the high single digits as a share of topics about Trump since the start of the survey in June, dipping below that at times, including around the first assassination attempt against the former president and the Republican National Convention.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgAlthough responses about Harris are generally still less negative in tone than those about Trump, there has been a notable decline in overall sentiment in the Harris responses, while Trump\u2019s numbers have rebounded slightly following a post-debate drop. For Harris, the negative shift is apparent across parties, with sentiments expressed by Democrats, Republicans and independents all tilting slightly more negative in the new data than in the week prior. For Trump, though, sentiment has held steady among Republicans, while shifting slightly less negative than the previous survey among independents and Democrats.The latest poll found that just under two-thirds of Americans (64%) reported seeing, reading or hearing something about Harris, compared with 68% who said the same about Trump. It marks the fourth straight week in which more people reported hearing about Trump than they did about Harris, and it\u2019s a notable drop from the previous week in the shares saying they\u2019d heard about each candidate (Trump down 7 points, Harris down 5).The overall level of attention to the presidential candidates now is lower than it was at this point in previous cycles, though that may be a side effect of debate timing. In 2020, for example, more than 8 in 10 Americans reported having heard news about Trump and Joe Biden in the same week of that campaign, but there was a presidential debate held on September 29. In 2016, there was a mid-September dip in attention ahead of that year\u2019s first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton, held on September 26.\u201cIt has been relatively quiet this week,\u201d one respondent to the latest survey wrote when asked about Trump. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of anything.\u201dCNN\u2019s Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report."}, {"title": "CNN Instant Poll: No clear winner in VP debate between Tim Walz and JD Vance", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/politics/election-poll-walz-vance-debate/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Registered voters who watchedTuesday\u2019s debate between vice presidential nomineesTim Walz and JD Vance were closely divided over which candidate did the better job, according to aCNN instant poll of debate watchers conducted by SSRS, and the event left viewers with more positive views of both candidates than they held pre-debate.Among debate watchers, Walz remains the candidate who\u2019s seen more positively and as more in touch with their needs and vision for the country.

He was also narrowly seen as doing a better job than Walz of defending his running mate. Both men, the poll finds, are viewed by a majority of debate watchers as qualified to assume the presidency if needed.

In June,two-thirds of debate watchersthought that formerPresident Donald TrumpoutperformedPresident Joe Biden, while a 63% majority who tuned in to the September debate between Trump andKamala Harrissaid thatthe vice president did the better job.Views of the vice presidential hopefuls split largely along pre-established political lines Tuesday night: 90% of debate watchers who support Trump\u2019s candidacy said\u00a0that Vance did the better job, while a slightly narrower 82% of the Harris supporters who tuned in saw Walz as the winner.The poll\u2019s results reflect opinions of the debate only among those voters who tuned in and aren\u2019t representative of the views of the full voting public. Debate watchers in the poll were 3 percentage points likelier to be Democratic-aligned than Republican-aligned, making for an audience that\u00a0was\u00a0about 5 points more Democratic-leaning than all registered voters nationally. That\u2019s a difference from the audience for the two presidential debates this year, both of which were slightly more GOP-leaning than the potential American electorate overall. What voters who don\u2019t tune in hear about an event\u00a0in the following days can often be as impactful as immediate views of the event itself.Following the debate, 59% of debate watchers said they had a favorable view of Walz, with just 22% viewing him unfavorably \u2013 an improvement from his already positive numbers among the same voters pre-debate (46% favorable, 32% unfavorable). Debate watchers came away from the debate\u00a0with roughly neutral views of Vance: 41% rated him favorably and 44% unfavorably. That\u2019s also an improvement from their image of Vance pre-debate, when his ratings among this group were deeply underwater (30% favorable, 52% unfavorable).Among debate watchers, Walz boosted his favorability far more among women than men, while Vance\u2019s gains were about the same among voters of both genders.

By contrast, views of Vance tilted negative, with 30% of registered voters rating him favorably, 42% unfavorably, and 27% offering no opinion.A 65% majority of debate watchers now say Walz is qualified to serve as president if necessary, with 58% saying the same of Vance.

He had a second attempt on his life recently at a golf course,\u201d one respondent wrote.Democrats were more likely to still focus on theSeptember presidential debate, bringing up words like \u201clie\u201d and references to Trump falsely claiming that migrants in Ohio were eating pets. \u201cHe continues to peddle the Springfield story about Haitian immigrants eating local pets,\u201d wrote another respondent. \u201cHe is using anti-Semitic tropes in his speeches. He continues to spread mistruths about his performance in the debate.\u201dPolitical independents mentioned both sets of topics, the survey found, and Americans across the aisle were about equally likely to mention words pointing more broadly to the presidential race, such as \u201ccampaign\u201d or \u201celection.\u201dSome of the disparity between Democrats and Republicans may stem from a difference in the media sources consumed. But it may also reflect differences in the news stories that resonate more with each group \u2014 as well the way partisans on each side are likely to describe those stories when asked, which often reflects their own political sentiments.Asked what they\u2019d seen, read or heard about Harris, meanwhile, Americans\u2019 responses included the word \u201cdebate\u201d \u2014 a reference both to her performance in her first presidential debate and her stated willingness for a rematch against Trump \u2014 as well asher interview with Oprah Winfrey.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgThe sentiment behind the words Americans used to describe what they\u2019d heard about Harris remained more positive than the words they used to describe the news about Trump. This doesn\u2019t mean\u00a0that they expressed warmer feelings about her personally but that what they said about her tended to be framed in relatively positive terms and tone.However, the gap in sentiments about the two candidates was significantly smaller than it was last week in the wake of the debate. The tone of responses relating to Harris were slightly more negative than positive, bringing her sentiment number roughly in line with where it was prior to the debate, while Trump\u2019s remained in negative territory."}, {"title": "CNN Poll: Harris and Trump are tied in North Carolina, while vice president leads in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd\u00a0District", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/27/politics/cnn-poll-harris-trump-north-carolina-nebraska/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Vice PresidentKamala Harrisand formerPresident Donald Trumpare tied among likely voters in North Carolina, while Harris holds a comfortable lead in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, according totwo new CNN polls conducted by SSRS.The North Carolina survey also shows scandal-plagued Lt.

Fewer see Harris\u2019 policies as dangerously extreme (35%).Trump holds an 8-point advantage over Harris on trust to handle the economy among North Carolina\u2019s likely voters, who also side with him on issues relating to crime and safety (by 7 percentage points) and immigration (by 11 points), but give Harris the edge on protecting democracy (by 4 points) and on handling abortion and reproductive rights (by 11 points). As in other battleground states, the economy is cited as the top issue in the presidential race by a plurality of voters.In Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District, Trump sees more erosion on the issues on which he\u2019s traditionally posted his strongest numbers: likely voters there are closely split between him and Harris on both the economy and immigration, and give Harris the lead on handling crime and safety (by 6 points), democracy (by 14 points) and abortion and reproductive rights (by 21 points).Nearly six in 10 likely voters in the district call Trump too extreme (57%), and about half (51%) say he\u2019s extreme enough to pose a threat.

But in the Omaha-area seat, Harris takes 20% support among those who disapprove of Biden, while in North Carolina, that ticks downward to 14%.The vast majority of likely voters in both North Carolina and Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District say they\u2019re at least somewhat confident that votes in their state will be accurately cast and counted in this year\u2019s presidential election. But just 41% in North Carolina say they\u2019re very confident, rising to a 59% majority in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District.The Nebraska seat also sees a far smaller partisan divide in election confidence: while Harris supporters there are 33 points more likely than Trump supporters to express high confidence in their state\u2019s election system, that expands to a 52-point gap between each candidate\u2019s supporters in North Carolina.Interviews were conducted September 20-25, 2024, online and by telephone with registered voters, including 931 voters in North Carolina and 749 in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional District.

Yet the poll suggests that Black likely voters currently supporting Trump or third-party candidates are not as locked into their choices as those Black likely voters who back the vice president.CNN\u2019s latest poll finds Harris leading Trump by 63 points among Black likely voters, 79% to 16%. That\u2019s a considerable improvement over Biden\u2019s 46-point advantage over Trump among registered voters in CNN\u2019s June poll, which was its last with the president at the top of the ticket. But that advantage falls short of the Biden-Harris campaign\u2019s 75-point margin among Black voters, according toexit polls from 2020.Since Harris\u2019 entrance into the race, enthusiasm among Black voters about the election appears to have grown. In the latest poll, 79% of Black registered voters say they would definitely vote, up from 68% in the June poll. For voters overall, that stood at 82% in the latest poll, about the same as in June. Black voters now are just as likely as other voters to say it is extremely important that they, personally, vote (both at 63%), while in June, Black registered voters were less likely to say the same (57% among Black voters, 66% overall).Harris\u2019 improvement over Biden\u2019s margins from earlier this year comes as the poll finds broad support for her from the 40% of Black likely voters who view Biden\u2019s presidency as a failure \u2013 Harris leads Trump 65% to 31% among these voters.The poll suggests Trump\u2019s improvements among Black voters relative to 2020 are driven largely by Black voters under the age of 60. Harris leads among Black voters aged 60 and over by 87 points, almost identical to Biden\u2019s 85-point margin in 2020, according to exit polls for the same group. This shrinks to a 55-point lead for Harris among Black voters younger than 60 (Biden won this group by 71 points in 2020, according to exit polls). Trump performs best among Black likely voters younger than 40, with 22% support.President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign rally at Girard College on May 29, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/FileStill, CNN\u2019s poll suggests that Harris has the potential to improve her margins. Her supporters are broadly locked in and unlikely to shift in the race \u2013 92% of Black likely voters who support Harris say their minds are already made up. But among those backing other candidates, a third say they may yet change their mind.Harris is also generally viewed more favorably among Black registered voters compared with registered voters overall, even after accounting for Black voters\u2019 overwhelming Democratic lean. Nearly 8 in 10 Black voters view Harris favorably, and Black Democrats view Harris slightly more positively than others in the party, while Black voters outside the Democratic Party offer far more positive views of her than do independents or Republicans of other races.Black voters who don\u2019t consider themselves Democrats are more likely than non-Democrats of other racial backgrounds to say that Harris has improved their view of the Democratic Party; that they would be proud or excited if she wins the election; and that her views are generally mainstream, with Black Democratic voters offering similar or modestly more positive views than others in their party. Among non-Democrats, Black voters also rate Harris as more aligned with their vision of a president than do other voters across all the attributes tested in the poll, including temperament, ability to understand the problems of people like themselves and leadership skills.That carries over to views of Trump too. Non-Democratic Black voters are more likely to view Trump\u2019s presidency as a failure than other voters who share their partisan perspective and are less likely to trust Trump over Harris on handling each of the issues tested in the poll, including the economy and immigration.While Black likely voters are largely focused on the same issues as the broader electorate, the CNN polling does find some differences among Democrats. Black likely voters are just as likely as all other groups to consider the economy their top issue (41%). Democratic Black likely voters, however, are twice as likely as Democratic likely voters overall to consider the economy their top issue (42%, compared with 19%). Democratic Black likely voters are also less apt than Democratic likely voters overall to say that protecting democracy or abortion and reproductive rights are their top issue.When asked which economic issue is most important to them, Black voters across the political spectrum are generally aligned with the overall electorate and put inflation at the top of the list. But Black likely voters are more likely than other voters to name jobs and wages as the top economic issue and less likely to say federal spending.Nearly 9 in 10 Black registered voters say the political system in the United States is in need of a major overhaul or major reforms, and a large majority (85%) say that the federal government does not do enough for Black Americans. Roughly half of Black voters (47%) say that the federal government does both too much for White Americans and too little for Black Americans. Still, Black registered voters are more likely than the broader electorate to say that they are satisfied with the influence people like themselves have on the political process (52%, compared with 38% overall).The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS online and by telephone September 19-22, 2024, among 2,074 registered voters nationwide drawn from a probability-based panel. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year\u2019s election. The survey included an oversample of Black registered voters to reach a total of 579; this group has been weighted to its proper size within the population for all survey results. Results for the full sample of registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.0 percentage points; it is the same among likely voters and larger for subgroups. Results among Black registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 7.8 percentage points; among Black likely voters, it is plus or minus 7.7 percentage points.CNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta and Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Promises Donald Trump has made so far in his campaign for a second term", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/04/politics/trump-campaign-promises-dg/", "content": ""}, {"title": "Promises Kamala Harris has made so far in her campaign", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/politics/kamala-harris-key-issues-dg/", "content": ""}, {"title": "3 charts that help explain how Trump\u2019s tariffs would work", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/donald-trump-tariffs/index.html", "content": "WashingtonCNN\u2014If former President Donald Trump returns to the White House, tariffs will once again play a major role in hispolicy agenda.Trump has repeatedly said he plans to impose an across-the-board tariff of either 10% or 20% on every import coming into the US, as well as a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports, in a bid to encourage American manufacturing.\u201cTariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,\u201d Trump said last month at a town hall event in Michigan.But as with many economic policies, there are trade-offs, and Trump doesn\u2019t talk about the negative effect tariffs could have on US businesses and consumers. He\u2019s also oftenfalsely describedhow tariffs work.Vice President Kamala Harris has referred to her opponent\u2019s tariff policy as a \u201cTrump Tax.\u201d Several independent studies have found that the new tariffs, if implemented, would raise costs for the average middle-class family, with estimates ranging between $1,350 and $3,900 a year.Here are three charts to help explain the impact of tariffs:For years, Trump has inaccurately claimed that foreign countries pay the tariffs. But in reality, the tariff is paid by the US-based company that imports the good.Studyafterstudy, includingone from the federal government\u2019s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, has\u00a0found\u00a0that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese products.In total, Trump\u2019s previous tariff actions put duties on about 14% of US imports \u2013 a relatively small share compared with the across-the-board tariff he has pledged to implement on 100% of imports if elected.When Trump was in office, he implemented tariffs on about $380 billion worth of goods imported into the US, according toa Tax Foundationanalysis.These duties applied to thousands of Chinese-made products, includingbaseball hats, luggage,bicycles, TVs andsneakers.The Trump tariffs also hit foreign steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar panels.The Biden-Harris administration has kept most of these tariffs in place andincreased the rate of some of the duties.Trump has said that if he wins the election,his administration coulduse tariffsto boost domestic manufacturing, create jobs and bring in billions of dollars to help pay for other policy initiatives.He\u2019s proposed extending tax cuts implemented in 2017, as well as eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay and Social Security benefits \u2013 all of which cost money.At a speech in September, Trump also said the tariff revenue couldpay for a child care initiative. AndCNBC reportedthat he\u2019s floated the idea of replacing the federal income tax with tariff revenue.\u201cEventually our country will be making substantially more money, over and above cost, and we will start a massive debt reduction,\u201d Trump said during an October speech at the Detroit Economic Club.But even if Trump implements tariffs on all US imports, the resulting revenue is unlikely to cover all these costs.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budgetrecently estimatedthat Trump\u2019s tariff plan would not generate enough revenue to pay for his other spending proposals.Ultimately, the group estimated that Trump\u2019s proposals would add $7.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.Harris\u2019 proposals, by comparison, would add an estimated $3.5 trillion."}, {"title": "How abortion rights and immigration are shaping the race for Arizona\u2019s 11 electoral votes", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/12/politics/arizona-election-abortion-rights-immigration/index.html", "content": "Chandler, ArizonaCNN\u2014David Tapia has watched one election after another from the sidelines, unfazed and largely uninterested in politics.

It\u2019s a pitch he has delivered with increasingly dark and offensive rhetoric that leans into stereotypes of foreigners from poorer countries.He has claimed \u2013 over the repeated objections of state and local leaders, including from his own party \u2013 thatHaitian migrants living in Springfield, Ohio, are \u201ceating the pets\u201d of the local residents. To the residents in a tiny Wisconsin town, he warned against what people from all over the world were \u201cdoing to the fabric, to the guts of our country.\u201d This week, Trump espoused nativist arguments about someimmigrants having \u201cbad genes,\u201dwhich cause them to commit crimes.It\u2019s a closing argument, though, that carries considerable risk. A steady stream of polls throughout the year and leading up to the final weeks of the presidential race have repeatedly affirmed that the economy is the issue of greatest concern to the most number of voters. In a recentCNN poll conducted by SSRS, more than 4 in 10 likely voters said the economy was the most important issue as they chose a candidate to lead the country. Only 12% said immigration ranked highest for them.Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are seen on a TV screen at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia on September 10, 2024, ahead of their presidential debate.Hannah Beier/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesRelated articleHow Harris and Trump are shifting their TV advertising in sprint to Election DayAgainst this reality, Trump\u2019s own campaign appears to have altered its approach to persuading the electorate in key battleground states byturning away from their candidate\u2019s favored message. In August, the Trump campaign spent about $15.5 million on television ads centered on immigration. For the next month, though, such ads about immigration were almost nonexistent\u00a0on the airwaves.Meanwhile, the campaign shifted even more ad dollars to messaging about the economy, accounting for about 77% of its broadcast advertising spending in September.In the face of this polling, though, Trump is betting on his gut, telling\u00a0a Wisconsin crowd on Sunday, \u201cI really don\u2019t agree\u201d that the economy will decide the election.\u201cI know they do all these polls,\u00a0and the polls say it\u2019s the economy,\u00a0and the polls say very strongly it\u2019s inflation,\u00a0and I can understand it a little bit,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTo me,\u00a0it\u2019s the horrible people that we\u2019re allowing into our country that are destroying our country. And it\u2019s the hardest problem to solve too.\u201dOn comfortable groundIllegal immigration is certainly comfortable terrain for Trump. He launched his first White House bid in 2015, railing against Mexican \u201cdrugs,\u201d \u201ccrime\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d entering the country. He then centered his campaign on a promise to \u201cbuild the wall\u201d at the southern border and make Mexico pay for it, something he failed to fulfill as president.Still, the 458 miles of new and replacement wall his administration built along the US-Mexico divide serve as a physical - yet unfinished - reminder of his long-standing fixation with keeping\u00a0outsiders from entering the country\u00a0illegally.Trump regularly laments that as an incumbent in 2020,\u00a0he could no longer galvanize support around the issue he believed won him the White House the first time. In his own retelling \u2013 which he often shares with supporters at rallies \u2013\u00a0\u201cI wanted to talk about the border. My people said, \u2018Sir, nobody wants to talk about the border anymore.\u2019\u201dThat is no longer the case as Trump seeks the Oval Office once again. The former president has resurfaced many of his promises from eight years ago, including a pledge to finish the wall and another to initiate the largest mass deportation in American history by deputizing local and state law enforcement to remove millions of undocumented people across the country.It\u2019s an issue he brings up\u00a0in most public appearances \u2013 even at events that are purportedly centered on other topics. Speeches advertised as remarks on the economy, crime or inflation often begin and end with extended riffs on his favorite topic, at times overshadowing the message he was on hand to deliver.For example, during\u00a0a visit to Savannah, Georgia, that his campaign billed as \u201cremarks on the tax code and US manufacturing,\u201d Trump said the word \u201cborder\u201d 29 times, outpacing mentions of \u201cmanufacturing.\u201d\u00a0In Tucson, Arizona, Trump stood in front of signage that said \u201cMake Housing Affordable Again\u201d but spent more time warning against migrants \u201ctaking Hispanic jobs, taking African American jobs, taking people that have been here a long time.\u201d The first reference to \u201chousing\u201d came 30 minutes into his speech.Trump has at times publicly panned his advisers for attempting to put such guardrails on his remarks.\u201cWe\u2019re doing this as an intellectual speech. We\u2019re all intellectuals today,\u201d Trump said in amocking tone in August in Asheville, North Carolina, where he was supposed to speak about the economy. \u201cThey say it\u2019s the most important subject. I think crime is right there. I think the border is right there, personally.\u201dFormer President Donald Trump listens to a question from the audience during a town hall-style campaign event on October 4, 2024, in Fayetteville, North Carolina.Win McNamee/Getty Images/FileRelated articleTrump suggests undocumented immigrants who commit murder have \u2018bad genes\u2019Trump\u2019s campaign pointed out that he has also held events centered on immigration, including a recent visit to Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, that featured small-town Americans whose lives were upended by violent acts committed by undocumented individuals.It also argued that immigration remains a top issues for many voters. A recent Gallup poll found 72% of Americans saying\u00a0it was an \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d important topic \u2013\u00a0the highest point in the organization\u2019s survey going back two decades. However, much of that is driven by Republicans, 63% of whom said the issue was\u00a0\u201cextremely\u201d important to their choice in November.That poll also showed independents split between Trump and Harris\u00a0over who would handle the issue better.Harris has lately sought to cut into Trump\u2019s perceived strength on the issue. In late September, she made her first visit to the US border as a presidential candidate. In a town hall Thursday hosted by Univision, she accused Trump of tanking a bipartisan border security bill earlier this year, asserting he wanted \u201crun on a problem.\u201d\u201cDonald Trump found out about that bill, realized it would be the solution, and told them not to put in on the floor for a vote because he would prefer to run on a problem, instead of fixing a problem,\u201d Harris said. \u201cReal leadership is about solving problems on behalf of the people.\u201d\u2018A bloody story\u2019There should be no misconceptions about Trump\u2019s\u00a0appearance in Aurora on Friday, which his campaign announced in a press release saying,\u00a0\u201cKamala\u2019s border bloodbath has made every state a border state.\u201dHow Aurora became a flashpoint in the race is illustrative of the speed at which online\u00a0right-wing fixations enter the mainstream.

The building\u2019s owner appeared to verify that description, but the city said the substandard housing conditions maintained by the landlord were the issue, not migrants. Meanwhile, local police have encountered some gang activity tied to a Venezuelan group, but rejected theories that the gang has taken over any buildings in the city.That didn\u2019t stop Trump, though, from seizing on the episode and escalating the falsehoods by claiming that Venezuelan gangs were taking over swathes of Colorado.

Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are now in the middle of the pack of flippable seats, along with Michigan, which remains at No. 4.The oddity of this year\u2019s fight for the Senate is that Democrats have consistently led in the public polling of key races, but it\u2019s Republicans who are poised to gain seats and, potentially, control of the chamber.That\u2019s a reflection of the Senate map \u2013 but also increasingly some post-Labor Day tightening as GOP spending picks up and voters get to know their candidates. Still, no public general election polling that meets CNN standards has shown the Republican nominee ahead in any of the seats that Democrats are defending, save for West Virginia.And two GOP targets \u2013 Arizona and Nevada \u2013 are moving down the list because Republicans have not kept the races as competitive as elsewhere.Earlier this year, those two states were Nos. 4 and 5.

West VirginiaSen. Joe ManchinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/FileWest Virginia is essentially out of reach for Democrats, who had little chance of holding this seat without Sen. Joe Manchin running for reelection. Manchin, now an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is likely to be succeeded by Republican Jim Justice, the state\u2019s two-term governor.Justice has had his share of negative headlines, but in a state poised to back Trump by a significant margin, it\u2019s hard to see a world in which Republicans don\u2019t pick up this open seat.2. MontanaSen. Jon TesterAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileDemocrat Jon Tester, who\u2019s running for a fourth term in a state Trump has twice carried by double digits, remains the most vulnerable Senate incumbent this year. Republicans feel confident their nominee,Tim Sheehy, has an edge \u2013 and both Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales and the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter have shifted their rating of the once toss-up race toward the GOP.Democrats still see a path to victory for Tester, who has a proven history of defying the partisan lean of his state by communicating both what he\u2019s done for Montanans and painting a contrast with his opponents.Democrats are trying that playbook against Sheehy, trying to define the wealthy businessman and retired Navy SEAL, who moved to Montana in 2014, as an out-of-state carpetbagger who cannot be trusted. Recentlyunearthed audio recordingsof Sheehy using racist stereotypes to refer to Native Americans has played into that message, with Democrats arguing that he\u2019s alienating a crucial demographic in the state. In a debate earlier this week, Sheehy acknowledged his comments were \u201cinsensitive,\u201d saying, \u201cI come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color sometimes.\u201dTester\u2019s campaign is now leaning into abortion rights on the airwaves \u2013 an issue that\u2019s on the ballot in Montana this year.

OhioSen. Sherrod BrownBonnie Cash/Getty Images/FileDemocratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing his toughest reelection in a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 points. Public polling still shows the three-term senator ahead of GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, although that is expected to tighten as more Republican voters come home to Moreno. Brown was at 47% to Moreno\u2019s 43% in a late SeptemberNew York Times/Siena College pollamong likely Ohio voters \u2013 not far outside the margin of error. But the reassuring news for Democrats: Brown was winning 10% of Trump voters.Democrats have seized on Moreno\u2019s recent comments at a town hall suggesting that some suburban women were single-issue voters when it comes to abortion and questioning why women over 50 would care about the topic. Brown pointed to the remarks as evidence that his opponent is out of step with the 57% of Ohio voters who last year approved a ballot measure protecting reproductive rights. WinSenate, a Democratic outside group, also launcheda new adwith a woman talking about the emergency abortion she underwent at 25 for an ectopic pregnancy, saying, \u201cOur lives don\u2019t belong in Bernie Moreno\u2019s hands.\u201d(Moreno\u2019s campaign said in a statement that he was \u201cclearly making a tongue-in-cheek joke about how Sherrod Brown and members of the leftwing media like to pretend that the only issue that matters to women voters is abortion,\u201d and that Moreno believes women \u201ccare just as much about the economy, rising prices, crime and our open southern border as male voters do.\u201d)The Senate contest in Ohio ranked as the most expensive congressional race on record, as of October 3, with total ad spending from both parties this cycle, including future reservations, exceeding $446 million, according to AdImpact.

Debbie StabenowAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileMichigan remains the most competitive open seat on this list. Democrat Elissa Slotkin has held a narrow edge in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, but the absence of an incumbent and the competitiveness of the presidential race in the Wolverine State\u00a0makes it one that could come down to the wire.Slotkin, a third-term congresswoman, led Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers 47% to 42% among likely voters in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll, with Slotkin drawing 6% of likely voters who also said they would vote for Trump. Slotkin has a strong fundraising record \u2013 her campaign announced raising $18 million in the third quarter \u2013 but Republicans are pouring more money into this state, with the Senate Leadership Fund recently announcing a $22.5 million investment.Slotkin has been runningads on abortion\u2013 an issue that has helped propel recent Democratic victories in the state. Herspotsclaim that Rogers\u2019 past support for abortion restrictions makes him untrustworthy on the issue now. \u201cI\u2019m scared that Mike Rogers will continue to take away my rights,\u201d says one woman in a spot who says she needed an abortion to save her life.Rogers has been responding on air, speaking directly to camera while holding hands with his wife inone new spot,saying he respects Michigan voters\u2019 decision on abortion rights and \u201cwon\u2019t do anything to change it\u201d in the Senate.Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, scored the endorsement of the state Farm Bureau\u2019s PAC, which had previously backed Stabenow (the chair of the Senate Agriculture panel). Rogers, whom Democrats have attacked for living in Florida after he left Congress a decade ago, is runningspotsthat tout his Michigan roots and public service. Rogers and Republicans are alsoattacking Slotkinandthe Biden administrationover plans to support the building of electric vehicles, using the misleading term \u201cmandate.\u201d5. PennsylvaniaSen. Bob CaseyAndrew Harnik/Getty ImagesDemocratic Sen. Bob Casey\u2019s race against Republican challenger Dave McCormick moves two spots up on the list in light of heavy GOP outside spending, some tighter polling and the competitiveness of the presidential race in a\u00a0state that is part of Democrats\u2019 so-called blue wall of must-win states.September polling from Marist, Quinnipiac University, the New York Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer, Franklin & Marshall, CBS News/YouGov and Fox News all gave Casey anywhere from a 5- to 9-point lead among likely voters. Polls from CNN and The Washington Post around the same time, however, showed no clear leader.The two candidates, who met on the debate stage for the first time Thursday night, have been hitting the airwaves with competing messages, as have their allied outside groups. Democrats are going after McCormick onabortion,includingonead that features footage of him referring to himself as \u201cpro-life.\u201d The Senate Leadership Fund, which is adding $28 million to GOP sending here, and the pro-McCormickKeystone Renewal PAChave been attacking Casey over inflation andimmigration.McCormick\u2019s tenure as the CEO of FreeMarkets \u2013 a Pittsburgh-based software company \u2013 has also been featured in ads on both sides.The Democratic group WinSenateis accusing him ofoutsourcing jobsand pointing to his management of the company to argue that \u201cConnecticut Dave\u201d\u00a0 \u2013 he owns a home in the Nutmeg State \u2013 \u201cwants to buy our Senate seat.\u201d McCormick is running ads featuringformer FreeMarkets employeespraising him and touting the company\u2019s hiring policies.6. WisconsinSen. Tammy BaldwinMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesWisconsin also moves up two spots on the list amid signs that some Republicans could be drifting home toward their party\u2019s nominee, Eric Hovde, in his challenge to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.The two-term senator maintained a modest edge over Hovde in aMarquette University Law School pollreleased this week \u2013 51% to 45% among likely voters when third-party candidates are included and 53% to 46% in a head-to-head matchup. Baldwin had a similar 7-point lead in aNew York Times/Siena College surveyof the two-person race\u00a0taken around the same time.While Baldwin has repeatedly outraised Hovde, the Senate Leadership Fund is also pouring funds \u2013 $17 million \u2013 into the Badger State, and Hovde has plenty of his own money to pay for ads at the lower candidate rate if he chooses. (We\u2019ll be eying his third-quarter fundraising filing for details about how much the Sunwest Bank CEO had loaned his campaign through September.) Ads from Hovde \u2013 whose campaign recently underwent a shakeup \u2013 havesought to tie Baldwinto Harris, attacking her over border security, fentanyl andtransgender rights.But Baldwin, who\u2019s made an effort tovisit the red, rural parts of Wisconsin, has a well-defined brand. She picked up theendorsementof the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation this week \u2013 a notable get for a Democrat running statewide. Much of Democratic advertising has played up Hovde\u2019s past controversial comments and sought to cast him as a California carpetbagger \u2013 he owns property in Laguna Beach, even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin and his family\u2019s company is a prominent state brand.7. ArizonaSen. Kyrsten SinemaAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileArizona is a conservative-leaning purple state, where Republicans should ordinarily be able to pick off a Senate seat \u2013 especially an open one. But in the race to replace retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, Republican candidate Kari Lake seems to have hit a ceiling.The 2022 gubernatorial nominee is well known in the state, but not necessarily for the right reasons. She still refuses to accept her loss for governor and, despite tethering herself to Trump, is underperforming his polling numbers.Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego led Lake by 10 points among likely voters in aMarist polland 13 points in aFox News survey, both from mid-September. Lake was polling behind Trump in both surveys by 6 points and 8 points respectively.Lake and the NRSC areblaming Gallegofor inflation and immigration \u2013 pointing to his support for what they\u2019re calling the \u201cKamala Inflation Act.\u201d (Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.) And while the Senate Leadership Fund hasn\u2019t spent here, a Club for Growth-affiliated group is also airingattackson the congressman. Gallego, a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was on the airwaves for months introducing himself to voters statewide as a Marine veteran and istouting his supportfrom law enforcement andRepublican voters. He announced raising $21.7 million in the third quarter.8. NevadaSen. Jacky RosenAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileNevada moves down two spots on the list as Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen appears to be in a stronger position against Republican opponent Sam Brown in a state where Democratic prospects seem to have picked up since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.Rosen, who appeared at a Harris rally in Las Vegas earlier this week, led Brown by 10 points in aCNN pollin late August. Like Lake in Arizona, Brown \u2013 an Army veteran who first ran for office in Texas and lost the GOP primary for Nevada\u2019s other Senate seat last year \u2013 also appears to be running up against a ceiling.Rosen and Democrats are hitting Brownover his previous stances on abortion\u2013 which is on the ballot this year in Nevada. Brown, who says he supports current state law legalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks, has said he\u2019d \u201cclose the door\u201d on backing a national abortion ban.Rosen has had a fundraising edge over her opponent, and this week, national Republicans canceled their remaining independent expenditures in the state in favor of running hybrid ads with Brown, which allows them to benefit from the lower candidate rate in the ultra-pricey Las Vegas media market \u2014 a strategy they\u2019ve employed in races across the country to try to compete with well-funded Democratic candidates on the airwaves.9. TexasSen. Ted CruzTierney L. Cross/Getty Images/FileNational Democrats\u2019 decision toinvest TV resourcesin Texas was the first major signal the party is putting money where its mouth is on the competitiveness of the Lone Star State this year. Democrats see Republican Sen. Ted Cruz as unpopular and his Democratic challenger, Rep.

But Democrats hope that Allred, a former NFL player who flipped a Dallas-area House seat the same year, is a more formidable challenger and can turn out more minority voters. (Allred would be the state\u2019s first Black senator if he wins.)Even Republicans acknowledge that Allred is running a good race, and the NRSC is investing here to help Cruz and the state party. Still, Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, so this remains an uphill battle for Allred.10. MarylandSen. Ben CardinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/GettyImages/FileThe race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin remains in tenth place this month as Angela Alsobrooks fights to keep this seat in party hands. Joe Biden won Maryland by 33 points in 2020, but Republican nominee Larry Hogan \u2013 a popular former two-term governor \u2013 has a supportive super PAC committing $18 million to tout hisindependence.Alsobrooks, the Prince George\u2019s County executive, led Hogan by 11 points in a recentWashington Post/University of Maryland poll.

The argument that Hogan would be another vote for Senate Republicans has been Democrats\u2019central pitchin deep-blue Maryland, especially onabortion rightsand Trump.Voters in the Post survey were split over whether Hogan would back his party\u2019s leaders in the Senate. He\u2019s winning nearly half of independents, as well as 18% of Democrats. And as he tries to combat Democratic attacks over abortion rights, he\u2019s run ads about being\u201cthe ultimate girl dad\u201dand \u201cone of the few Republicans who never caved\u201d to Trump. Hogan rejected the former president\u2019s endorsement earlier this year, but Democrats quickly seized on Trump saying that he\u2019d like to see Hogan win.Maryland\u2019s Future, the super PAC backing Hogan, is trying to localize the race byattacking Alsobrooksfor improperly taking advantage of tax breaks she did not qualify for, as firstreported by CNN.

Wade in 2022, eliminating the national right to an abortion.Most of the proposed ballot measures aim to enshrine the right to an abortion in state constitutions.\u00a0They follow a series of restrictivetrigger lawsthat went into effect following the Dobbs decision, along with abortion policies that were handed down by politicians or decided by state supreme courts since the decision.Anti-abortion organizers backed a handful of initiatives aimed at restricting abortion access, thoughsimilar restrictive measures have failedin the few states where votes have been held in the past couple of years.Abortion measures on the ballot in NovemberTen states \u2014\u00a0Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and South Dakota \u2014 have already secured abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. All eyes are on Florida, which has served as a critical access point for people seeking services in a region of the country that is fast becoming anabortion care desert. A six-week abortion banreplaced the state\u2019s 15-week banon May 1.Nebraska Secretary of State Robert Evnen announced in August that for the first time in the state\u2019s history, two conflicting petition efforts made the same ballot.Now voters in Nebraska will voteon whether abortion rights will be enshrined in the constitution or whether the state\u2019s current 12-week ban will be preserved.In this May 2023 photo, hundreds of people gather at the Nebraska Capitol to protest against a proposed abortion ban.Margery Beck/APRelated articleNebraska ballot can include competing measures to expand or limit abortion rights, high court rulesAfter organizers secured the New York Equal Rights Amendment on the 2024 ballot, it was briefly struck from the ballot by a state judge. State Attorney General Letitia James appealed that decision, and a state appeals court restored the measure to the ballot in June.A measure in Missouri\u00a0that\u00a0seeks to broadly protect reproductive care\u00a0has made it onto the ballot, while\u00a0an opposing\u00a0measure to permanently ban abortion never made it out of the state\u2019s legislative session.States with potential abortion ballot measuresOrganizers in states across the country have continued to work to secure funding, gather signatures and jump through the legal hoops necessary to secure abortion measures on the 2024 ballot.In most states, the process entails collecting a certain number of signatures by a designated deadline, while others require the additional step of having the ballot language approved by a state court, according to campaign organizers. The abortion rights measures are largely backed by coalitions of reproductive health advocates, many of which have fundraised to secure the money to support the campaigns.Organizers in Arkansas collected and submitted signatures for a proposed abortion rights measure, but the Secretary of State rejected their petition, saying the organizers did not correctly submit paperwork regarding paid canvassers. The state\u2019s supreme court sided with the secretary, ensuring the measure will not be on the ballot this November.Lawmaker proposed measures in Iowa and Missouri to restrict or exclude the right to abortion in state constitutions did not make it out of legislative sessions. Lawmakers in Pennsylvania proposed a measure barring the use of public funding for abortions, which is unlikely to pass the state legislature.States that have voted on abortion post-DobbsSeven states have already seen a vote on abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and reproductive health advocates have been heartened by the overwhelming support for abortion access among voters. Every measure aimed at protecting abortion access has passed, while all measures to restrict it have failed.While support for abortion access is considered a given in states like California, organizers say these votes offer an important layer of legal protection for patients and providers \u2013 and send a message to elected officials about what voters want.CNN\u2019s Molly English contributed to this report."}, {"title": "What happens if there\u2019s a tie in 2024?

To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.CNN\u2014When Robert F. Kennedy Jr.suspended his presidential campaign, he did it in the most complicated way.Get your head around this: Kennedy will take himself off the ballot in certain key states, but he is encouraging supporters to vote for him in safe red and blue states so that he can feature in a \u201ccontingent election\u201d if former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris tie.In the battleground states, Kennedy said he\u2019s supporting Trump.Could Kennedy actually feature in a \u201ccontingent election?\u201d Short answer: No. He could not take part unless he won electoral votes, something that does not seem to be mathematically possible. Perhaps he\u2019s envisioning an elector going rogue and supporting him in defiance of voters, but Kennedy did not share details of his thinking.For the facts about contingent elections, read on.With two presidential candidates fighting over a mere 538 Electoral College votes, a tie scenario is more than possible. It\u2019s actually kind of surprising there has only been one tied election so far, in 1800, between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.That tie was the result of a failure of coordination by Democratic-Republicans, but it led to the nation\u2019s first \u201ccontingent election,\u201d decided in the House of Representatives.Could a tie actually happen this year?Yes. While a tie is not a likely outcome, it is something to be ready for. Here is one plausible scenario for the 2024 election:If Harris wins Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada and a single electoral vote in Nebraska, all of which Joe Biden won in 2020, but she loses Pennsylvania and Georgia, there\u2019s a tie, 269-269.The website270 to Winalso has more tied-election scenarios.Unlike every other state, Maine and Nebraska award two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner of each congressional district. Those individual, competitive electoral votes in Maine and Nebraska become hugely consequential in potential tie scenarios.Make your own 269-269 scenario withCNN\u2019s interactive election map.What happens if there\u2019s a tie?If there\u2019s a 269-269 tie, or if a third party or independent candidate wins electoral votes and keeps a candidate from reaching an Electoral College majority of 270, the next step is the same. It\u2019s called a \u201ccontingent election.\u201dAccording to the12th Amendment, enacted in the wake of that divisive 1800 election, if no candidate gets a majority of the Electoral College votes, the new Congress, which would have just been sworn in on January 3, chooses the president. The Senate would choose the vice president.When would a \u2018contingent election\u2019 occur?According to an analysis by theCongressional Research Service, a contingent election would occur on January 6, immediately after members of Congress met to count electoral votes and determined that no candidate had a majority.There is a lot of information from that CRS report in this story. While it dates back to 2017, it\u2019s still a valuable resource.How would the process work?The nation would clearly be divided. Lawmakers could be torn between supporting their preferred candidate and the one their state\u2019s voters preferred.In a contingent election, the House selects the president and the Senate selects the vice president. House members can only choose from among the top three finishers in the Electoral College for president, and senators can choose from among the top two finishers for vice president. Kennedy would presumably need to win electoral votes \u2013 win a state or a congressional district in Nebraska or Maine \u2013 in order to be an option in a contingent election. There\u2019s no chance of that happening at the moment.Rather than voting as individuals, each state delegation in the House would get one vote, although how the state delegations select their preferred candidate is not spelled out.A simple majority, 26 state delegation votes, would appoint the new president.If state delegations in the House did not select a president by Inauguration Day, January 20, the new vice president selected by the Senatewould become temporary president. It is possible the Senate could select a vice president when the House is deadlocked, because in the Senate each senator would get one vote.If the Senate had not selected a vice president by January 20, the presidential succession plan in the 20th Amendment temporarily takes effect. First in line after the vice president is the speaker of the House, currently Mike Johnson, although it could be a different Republican or a Democrat if Democrats win a majority in the House this November.Does either side have an advantage?If the Electoral College already benefits smaller and more rural states, the contingent election process \u2013 in which each state, regardless of population, has an equal vote \u2013 gives them a huge advantage.California and Texas get the same say as Delaware and Wyoming in a contingent election. Plus, Washington, DC, which gets three votes in the Electoral College, would be cut out of the contingent election.There\u2019s nothing to require state delegations to honor the winner of their state\u2019s vote. And in closely divided states, the results in single seats, perhaps determined by gerrymandered congressional maps, could swing a delegation\u2019s vote.CNNRelated articleWhat to expect in the sprint to Election Day \u2013 and beyondHeading into the 2024 election, Republican lawmakers held a majority in 26 states, compared with Democrats, who held the majority in 22, with ties in Minnesota and North Carolina. Republicans in North Carolina have changed the state\u2019s congressional map, however, and it is likely to have a majority-Republican congressional delegation in January. Republicans are likely to maintain\u00a0their advantage next year, especially if voters are so split that they deliver a national tie at the top of the ticket.In Arizona, for instance, who is to say that a potential majority of Republican members of Congresswould vote for the Democratic candidate, even if Harris pulled out a narrow win there?Would Alaska\u2019s Democratic member of Congress, assuming she wins reelection, vote for the Democrat for president even though her state is likely to go for Trump in November?Why does this bizarre tie-break system exist?It\u2019s actually meant to be an improvement. The way the Electoral College was first assembled, electors voted for two candidates. Whoever got the most votes was president and whoever got the second-most votes was vice president.By the time political parties were forming \u2013 Federalists and Democratic-Republicans in 1800 \u2013 electors needed to coordinate to cast more votes for their presidential pick than their vice presidential pick.In the1800 election, a rematch of 1796, Jefferson\u2019s Democratic-Republicans beat incumbent President and Federalist John Adams.But the Democratic-Republicans were poorly coordinated or bad at counting and foolishly cast equal numbers of votes for their presidential pick, Jefferson, and his running mate, Burr.Out of pique, when the early version of the contingent election rolled around, the Federalists, who still controlled the House at that time, backed Burr. Despite the intervention of Alexander Hamilton, a noted Federalist, it took 36 rounds of voting to finally elect Jefferson.By 1804, the 12th Amendment was being ratified.Has a contingent election happened in the years since the tied election of 1800?Yes.In 1824, multiple candidates got votes in the Electoral College but none of them received a majority, triggering a contingent election.Amazingly, from today\u2019s perspective, all of the candidates who got Electoral College votes that year were from the same Democratic-Republican political party, although they were split into regional sects.Andrew Jackson won 40% of the popular vote and got the most votes in the Electoral College with 99 of the 131needed for victory. But the House ultimately picked his top rival, John Quincy Adams, whose father lost that 1800 election.Jackson would have his revenge with a victory four years later, and John Quincy Adams would round out his career as the only former president to be elected to Congress, the body that made him president.Another contingent election occurred with the 1836 race, but just for vice president. Virginia\u2019s electors did not like Robert M. Johnson, the running mate of election winner Martin Van Buren, and withheld their votes for him in the Electoral College. The Senate later elevated Johnson to the vice presidency in a contingent election.What about the disputed election of 1876?In 1876, when there was a contested outcome, the contingent election system was bypassed.That year, at the height of Reconstruction, the issue was not that no person got a majority in the Electoral College, but rather that three Southern states \u2013 Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina \u2013 sent multiple slates of electoral votes to Washington, DC, after the state elections were disputed. And in Oregon, there was a dispute over one elector.Congress created a special bipartisan commission, with one more Republican than Democrats, to determine which candidate should get the 20 disputed electoral votes. They ultimately gave the votes to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes even though Democrat Samuel Tilden got more popular votes.Hayes thenlargely ended Reconstruction, perhaps as part of a secret deal that gave him the White House.This story has been updated with additional developments."}, {"title": "What to expect in the sprint to Election Day \u2013 and beyond", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/politics/election-2024-key-dates-dg/index.html", "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter.

In 2020, Biden won five states that Trump won in 2016. Those states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 could again be the focus in 2024 when Harris, who turns 60 in October, takes on Trump.It\u2019s important to be sure you\u2019re registered to vote as soon as possible, which can usually be done online. Twenty-three states and Washington, DC, allow Election Day voter registration.Election Day and beyondUS law requires federal elections to take place on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that\u2019s November 5.People who don\u2019t vote early will hit their local voting location. Polls will close at different times around the country. Due to the rise of voting by mail, if key states are close, like they were in 2020, we probably won\u2019t know the winner on Election Day.Regardless, expect lawsuits in certain states and the potential for recounts in others.

It\u2019s this new Congress that, in the unlikely event ofan Electoral College tie, would settle the election. Each state would get one vote for president in the House of Representatives.In any event, lawmakers gather on January 6, as everyone should remember from 2020, to count electoral votes. Harris will preside.

Now, he is as excited to vote for Harris as he is to knock doors organizing for her and other Democrats.\u201cAt the time, I was like kind of iffy, feeling like everybody else, kind of undecided,\u201d Johnson said of his choices before Harris got in the race. \u201cBut now that Kamala got the ball and she rollin\u2019 with it,\u00a0I feel like oh yeah. \u2026\u00a0She\u2019s making a good image for herself and for the Democrats.\u201dA year ago, Lang was blunt about Biden\u2019s struggles in Milwaukee\u2019s Black neighborhoods.

Both are part of a CNN project, calledAll Over the Map, designed to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are part of crucial voting blocs.In the twoprior conversations, both said Biden\u2019s age was a concern for many young voters who felt little connection to the octogenarian president. Now, with Harris as the Democratic nominee, the energy and enthusiasm difference is obvious.Gray now works as a digital organizer for a progressive group.\u201cI have noticed a significant shift in activity, across the board,\u201d Gray said.Jalisatgi is back on campus as a first-year law student, and just switched her voter registration to Michigan.\u201cA lot of my out-of-state friends are switching their registration to Michigan because it is a battleground state,\u201d Jalisatgi said.The voting hub at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.CNNAnd while Gray and Jalisatgi have moved on, the College Democrats are in high gear for election crunch time. A Harris campaign official stopped by a meeting during our latest visit and a crowded room of students spent time phone banking after getting a pep talk from the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer.\u201cThe work that you are doing is so important and I am energized by what I see happening with all these Dem clubs on campuses. You are kicking a**. So, we just got to keep rolling through,\u201d Whitmer said over a video link.Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell stopped by in person, and warned against overconfidence.\u201cI\u2019m going to look you all in the eye and tell you, neither candidate is winning in Michigan right now.\u201dNo encampment on campus, but tensions still high over Israel-Hamas conflictThe almost everywhere-you-look focus on registration and early voting at the Ann Arbor campus is remarkable.One registration table we stopped by on our latest visit was in a familiar spot: on the same campus path where students last semester built an encampment to air their grievances at Israel, at the Biden administration and at school officials they were pushing to divest from companies that do business with Israel.The school will not allow a new encampment, so it is harder to gauge how much the raw anger of last semester has carried over to the new school year \u2013 and into voting decisions.\u201cA lot of that energy, because it can\u2019t happen in a physical space \u2013 it\u2019s still occupying a lot of online space,\u201d Gray said.Jalisatgi sees it directed less at Harris and more at university officials.\u201cPeople still very much care that this is ongoing and that the university is complicit in contributing to it,\u201d Jalisatgi said. \u201cI\u2019m seeing universities putting out a lot of new free speech guidelines, new regulations for how they want to curb free speech or how they want to regulate it.\u201dUniversity of Michigan student Max Scheske walks with John King on campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan.CNNThe Ann Arbor College Republicans would not let CNN into a meeting they held during our recent visit.Member Max Scheske, a junior, said attendance and energy are up some as the election draws close. But he also said the group was pretty evenly divided when it comes to enthusiasm forDonald Trump.\u201cWe certainly do have our, you know, \u2018Trump is basically Jesus\u2019 wing of the club,\u201d Scheske said. \u201cBut we do have a very sizeable, you know, very critical of Trump.\u201dScheske describes himself as libertarian and Trump as a populist. \u201cSo, he is kind of hit or miss with me,\u201d Scheske said.There are Harris yard signs and posters and placards all around Ann Arbor. Signs of Trump support are much harder to find. On campus, Scheske said Trump\u2019s unequivocal support for Israel makes it harder to win over Democrats critical of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s defense of the Jewish state.\u201cIf it was up to me, he would not have been the Republican nominee,\u201d Scheske said.\u2018We feel a sense of betrayal\u2019The biggest risk for Harris is that young voters stay home, skip the presidential line on the ballot, or vote third party.In May, Wayne State student Summer Matkin was leaning third party. Biden was the Democratic nominee then, and she had concerns both about his age and the Israel-Hamas conflict.Now, she calls Harris \u201cthe safest option\u201d even though she is frustrated the bloodshed in the Middle East continues.There were signs of trouble for Harris, though, when we stopped by a meeting of the Wayne State Syrian Students Association.The roughly 20 students in the room did not want to be quoted by name or have their faces captured on camera. But when asked if they would have a hard time voting for Harris, nearly every hand in the room went up.Wayne State student Wahbeh Nuseibeh talks with John King in Dearborn, Michigan.CNNLikewise, Wahbeh Nuseibeh, a 26-year-old Wayne State student, said he would not vote for Harris in 2024 after voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020.\u201cWe feel a sense of betrayal,\u201d said Nuseibeh, who is Palestinian.\u201cI\u2019m not voting for Kamala Harris. I cannot in good conscience,\u201d he said. In his view, his tax dollars pay for bombs shipped to Israel \u201cto kill my friends and family overseas.\u201dNuseibeh will likely choose a third-party option.\u201cDonald Trump is a threat to our democracy and a threat to our society,\u201d he said in an interview at a Yemeni coffee shop in majority Arab American Dearborn just outside Detroit.Maya Siegmann will cast her vote for Harris, though she found the vice president\u2019s debate answers far too vague.\u201cShe didn\u2019t directly answer most of the questions and seemed to go around them or could not give a real answer,\u201d Siegmann said. \u201cAnd when the topic of the Israel-Hamas war came up, there wasn\u2019t really a solid response as to how she would solve it.\u201dSiegmann is active in the Hillel campus Jewish organization at Wayne State and just got back from a summer in Israel. There, she said, she was asked a lot about public opinion in the United States.\u201cThe response was basically that the propaganda war, the social media war, the news war that Hamas and Israel are fighting, Hamas is winning right now,\u201d Siegmann said.Wayne State student Maya Siegmann talks with John King on campus in Detroit, Michigan.CNNLast year was tense on campus and as both the October 7 anniversary of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel and then the US election draw near, Siegmann said she is mindful that emotions could get high again. She is a proud Jew and fervent supporter of Israel, but she is also critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his conduct of the war.But she says such nuance can get quickly lost when passions get high.\u201cI worry that when it does come up, because we have different classes, like policy classes, that it will be an argument and less a discussion.\u201dThe campus has a large Arab and Muslim population, and Siegmann said this semester she is making more of an effort to get to know classmates better.\u201cThese are people I am going to be with until I complete my degree or degrees,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I want to kind of form that solid groundwork so that I can build off that.\u201d"}, {"title": "Economic worries boost Trump\u2019s Hispanic support in battleground Nevada", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/nevada-hispanic-voters-trump-harris/index.html", "content": "Henderson, NevadaCNN\u2014The sounds of blasting and bulldozing in the hills overlooking Las Vegas are proof change is a constant here, with the new $5 million homes evidence of the vibrant, upscale demand.It is progress, longtime Las Vegas real estate agent Zoila Sanchez says, as she points out new construction from the patio of her own home in suburban Henderson.

The state had the highest pandemic unemployment rate, at one point just shy of 31% \u2013 more than twice the national average. The statistics now are clear: the jobs are back, and then some. But the bruises linger, and working families trying to put the pandemic stress behind them have faced housing and inflation pressures.\u201cWe have seen the record numbers at the casinos,\u201d Regalado said. \u201cBut some businesses are struggling still.\u201dCerros said Fiesta 98.1\u2019s advertisers are mostly small, Latino-owned businesses. \u201cA lot of small businesses are struggling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not 100% yet, to where it was.

A veteran, retired police officer and now the owner of the 911 Taco Bar in El Mercado, a former JC Penny department store that now houses dozens of Hispanic small businesses.When we first met last December, he was undecided in the presidential race and unhappy with the prospect of a Biden-Trump rematch. In that meeting, he bet neither Trump nor Biden would be on the ballot in the end. He was half right.Leaning Harris is where Munoz is now \u2013 intrigued and excited but also still frustrated he cannot find more specifics about her promise to help small businesses like his.\u201cI\u2019ve been checking her website and you read it, but it\u2019s not specific,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cWe do need to move forward. We need a different plan to get over the hump with this inflation that has caused severe damage to a lot of businesses. \u2026 She needs to be more direct.\u201dA scorching summer was the latest challenge, stifling the catering business critical to Munoz\u2019s bottom line.\u201cWe had over 30 days of 110 degrees,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cSo we had a lot of cancellations because people didn\u2019t want to be outside.\u201dAntonio Munoz, owner of 911 Taco Bar, checks in on his staff during the lunch hour rush.Jacqueline Kalil/CNNNow he sees a competitive election as a pause button.\u201cBecause people are afraid to go out and spend,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to expect when it comes around to a new administration.\u201dEvidence of new energy for Harris begins at home for Munoz. He says his wife is excited, and that he shares her view that there is inspiration in the vice president\u2019s story.\u201cShe came up with immigrant parents, which to me, it\u2019s amazing for someone like that to come up and be able to be president,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hit for people.\u201dHe also has no patience when Trump slams immigrants or berates the country he wants to lead.\u201cOne of the things that hurts me the most is for him to talk down America,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cAmerica is a world leader. We have always been. \u2026 We\u2019re the best. No matter who is there. The people make it the best.\u201dBut Munoz said many friends and others he encounters at community events are nostalgic for the pre-Covid economy and think that Trump is a better choice for their bottom line. Nevada also elected a Republican governor in 2022, and Munoz believes that makes it more hospitable climate for Trump this year.\u201cHe has grown,\u201d Munoz said of the former president\u2019s support among Hispanics. \u201cI have friends that were Democrats who have turned the page. They feel that the country is not going in the right direction.\u201dHarris, though, is more competitive than Biden would have been and Munoz predicts a Nevada nailbiter.\u201cIt\u2019s a 50-50 tossup,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to be out here with a direct message and talking to the voters out here.

I don\u2019t think there is any way I could vote any other direction.\u201dEbersole was a Nikki Haley supporter when we first met before the Iowa caucuses.

But her maverick streak has limits. Her family and her farm come first, so she came home to Trump.\u201cBecause we have to put the American people first,\u201d she said in an interview along the fence line of the Ebersole cattle farm. \u201cI think that the policies\u00a0that have been in place in the Harris-Biden administration \u2014 they hurt this. They hurt our land and they hurt the people of middle America the most.\u201dEbersole is part of ourAll Over the Map project, an effort to\u00a0track\u00a0the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are members of critical voting blocs or areas in those\u00a0states.John King talks to Iowa voter Shanen Ebersole on her cattle ranch in Kellerton, Iowa.CNNIowa was an early 2024 battleground \u2014 the first test of whether Trump\u2019s grip on the GOP had been loosened by his 2020 loss, his conduct on January\u00a06, 2021,\u00a0or any of the myriad criminal and civil legal proceedings he has faced since leaving the White House.Trump won the caucuses with 51%\u2014 the beginning of a march to the nomination that proved his grip\u00a0on the party\u00a0remains quite firm but also exposed important weaknesses.One was among Republican women like Ebersole \u2014 those who supported Haley or other GOP contenders because they object to Trump\u2019s combative and often caustic tone and, in many cases, see him as wandering too far from the conservative principles that drew them to the Republican Party.Iowa, of course, is not considered a battleground\u00a0in the general election this year.\u00a0Ebersole\u2019s \u201cpretty simple\u201d decision to support Trump despite her reservations helps explain why.In the 12 presidential elections dating back to 1976, Iowa was evenly split in its choice for president. But Republicans have dominated of late. Trump won in both 2016 and 2020. Both\u00a0of the state\u2019s\u00a0US senators are Republican, as are six of Iowa\u2019s seven statewide constitutional offices.Voters who say life was better under Trump fear Democrats have shifted too far leftEbersole shared a view quite common here: that the Democratic Party is trending more liberal, more coastal, and more in favor of government mandates in climate and land policies.\u201cI\u2019m not saying that there are not things we can do to improve,\u201d Ebersole said. \u201cBut if you talk to a lot of us, we\u2019re already doing things. There\u2019s a huge regenerative movement here in the Americas by choice, not my mandate. I think that is the main thing that matters in politics \u2014 that we get to choose. We\u2019re not being mandated to choose. \u2026 We just want to live in the middle of nowhere and raise cows and feed our neighbors across the country.\u201dEbersole said Trump\u2019s trade policies were better for her business.\u201cIt was much harder to import beef,\u201d she said. \u201cNow most meat that you eat, on the American grocery store shelves, isn\u2019t American beef, and that really concerns me\ufeff.\u201d\u00a0She sees Vice President Kamala Harris as more liberal \u2014 and more likely to favor activist government \u2014 than President\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden.\u201cShe is willing to push her agendas on those of us who live a totally different life,\u201d Ebersole said,\u00a0tying Harris to California\u2019s policies.\u00a0\u201cOur California rancher friends are completely decimated by the policies and the government.

On recent visits toArizonaandPennsylvania, for example, some of our Republican voters who are not Trump fans said they would give Harris a chance to make her case.\u00a0But in\u00a0Iowa, the Republicans in our group were harshly critical of the vice president and more comfortable with coming home to the GOP despite issues they may have\u00a0with Trump and his most vocal MAGA allies.\u201cMost of the people that vote for Trump are just quiet people who want to live our own lives in our own place,\u201d Ebersole said. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to tell those people to quiet down a bit.\u201dIt may seem an odd time to visit Iowa, given its status as a solid red state,\u00a0when considering each candidate\u2019s strategy to win 270 electoral votes. But we wanted to better understand why those who were so critical of Trump at the beginning of the campaign cycle are so comfortable supporting him now.\u00a0We wanted a firsthand look\u00a0at how our Iowa group \u2014 the first one we visited in August 2023\u00a0\u2014 views\u00a0the race now that Harris has replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket and chosen a Midwest governor, Tim Walz of Minnesota, to be her running mate.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to figure out how to deal with her,\u201d Chris Mudd, a businessman\u00a0from Cedar Falls,\u00a0said of Trump, whom he\u00a0ardently supports. \u201cI think he spends too much time bashing and complaining. \u2026 I think he\u2019ll catch his stride.

We\u2019re selling the power to help people save money.\u201dMudd also believes Trump is more tested on the world stage.\u201cI think about what\u2019s happening in the Middle East,\u201d Mudd said. \u201cWho would I want to negotiate that peace? Kamala or Donald Trump? And for me, it\u2019s simple.\u201dMudd believes the media is too soft on Harris, and he echoes Trump and his MAGA media allies in complaining the vice president rarely takes questions from reporters. He also echoes another line coming from Trump, suggesting there is no way Harris can win an honest election.\u201cThere were shenanigans,\u201d Mudd said when asked what he would think if Harris wins the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t think she has a chance to win in a fair fight. \u2026 I just don\u2019t believe it is possible. I really don\u2019t. \u2026\u00a0Many like me would think the same thing: If Kamala Harris gets 81 million votes, something really went haywire.\u201dPreviously leaning toward Biden in a 2020 rematch, but now for TrumpBetsy Sarcone considers such talk a waste of time.\u201cI don\u2019t buy the stolen election,\u201d said Sarcone, a mother of three who lives in the Des Moines suburbs. \u201cIf she wins, she wins. I am not getting on that bandwagon.\u201dBut\u00a0the fact that\u00a0Sarcone plans to vote for Trump is a big change from our first conversation just over a year ago.Then, she said it was time for the Republican Party to find new leadership and that if the 2024 election ended up as a 2020 rematch, she would vote for Biden.John King sits with Iowa voter Betsy Sarcone and her family in West Des Moines, Iowa.CNNBut Sarcone said grocery prices are still too high, her real estate business too slow.\u201cI would describe myself as being resigned to voting for Donald Trump,\u201d Sarcone said. \u201cI just can\u2019t vote for the status quo and I was absolutely better off during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency than I am today.\u201dSarcone has a dim view of Harris.\u201cShe\u2019s already been in office,\u201d she said. \u201cShe could have done something about the economy.

We had four years of Trump. We know what Trump is. We know what to expect. We all survived. \u2026 I\u2019m not voting for him to be my valentine. I\u2019m not voting for him to be my best friend.

I never saw a town \u2013 they never \u2013 you don\u2019t use teleprompters, we don\u2019t use teleprompters, period, pretty much. You don\u2019t use \u2018em for town halls.\u201dFacts First:Trump\u2019s claims are both wrong. The moderator of the Univision town hall and the president of Univision News both refuted the claim that Harris used a teleprompter at the town hall, noting Thursday that the teleprompter that was seen on the broadcast had text in Spanish, not English, and that it was material for the moderator, not Harris. And Trump uses teleprompters for most of his speeches, though he also regularly ad-libs additional remarks.The false claim that Harris used a teleprompter at the town hall generated millions of views on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. It was made by several right-wing commentators with significant followings, includingBenny Johnson,Charlie Kirk,Greg Priceand Fox News host Sean Hannity.Univision News president Daniel Coronell, responding to Price\u2019s claim that \u201cKamala is using a teleprompter during her \u2018town hall\u2019 with Univision,\u201dwroteon X: \u201cThat\u2019s not true. The teleprompter that displays a text written in Spanish was a support element for the town hall moderator. I can tell you this with first-hand knowledge because I was in charge of the television program.\u201dTown hall moderator Enrique Acevedo, responding to Johnson\u2019s claim that \u201cUnivision accidentally broadcast proof that Kamala used a teleprompter at her town hall,\u201dwroteon X: \u201cThe prompter displayed my introduction (in Spanish) and then it switched to a timer. Any claim to the contrary is simply untrue.\u201dAcevedo and Coronell both posted their debunkings late Thursday night, but the viral posts from Price, Johnson and Kirk remained online as of 4 p.m. on Friday; Hannity deleted his post. Price, Johnson and Kirk did not respond to CNN requests for comment on Friday.Trump has made teleprompter-related comments a staple of his recent criticism of Harris as he has insulted her intelligence. Last month, hefalsely claimedthat Harris used notes in a televised interview with CNN.The right-wing commentators\u2019 inaccurate posts claiming Harris used a teleprompter at the Univision town hall relied on a 12-second clip that was posted Thursday by the Trump campaign\u2019s \u201cTrump War Room\u201d account. The campaign did not make an explicit claim in itsown post; rather, it simply wrote, \u201cThe teleprompter\u201d and added an emoji of big eyes.Its allies did the rest."}, {"title": "Fact check: Trump, on a lying spree, made at least 40 separate false claims in two Pennsylvania speeches", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/10/politics/fact-check-trump-pennsylvania-speeches/index.html", "content": "WashingtonCNN\u2014Former President Donald Trump is on a lying spree.As Election Day draws nearer, the Republican presidential nominee has made false claim after false claim on a dizzying variety of subjects. He has both come up with new falsehoods on pressing issues, most notably the federal response to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, and repeated old favorites about subjects he has been railing about since his 2016 presidential campaign.We went through the speeches Trump made at his two Wednesday campaign rallies in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, one in Scranton and one in Reading. In those two addresses alone, he uttered at least 40 separate false claims.Here is a fact check.FEMA and migrants: Trumpfalsely claimedof the Federal Emergency Management Agency: \u201cThey have no money. You know where they gave the money? To illegal immigrants coming in.\u201d He alsosaid, \u201cThey spent all their funds; they have no funds to take care\u2026\u201dThis is false in two ways. FEMA doeshave moneyfor the immediate responses to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, though a string of recent disasters has depleted its disaster relief fund; the fundhad about $11 billionremaining as of Wednesday. And FEMAdid notgive all of its disaster relief money to undocumented people; rather, as mandated by Congress, FEMA also administers an entirely separate pool of money for sheltering migrants.FEMA and employees: Trump added another false claim about FEMA,saying: \u201cThey have no workers, they have no nothing.\u201d FEMA hasmore than 20,000 employees.Harris and the response: Trump falselyclaimedthat as desperate people tried to survive Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, Vice President Kamala Harris \u201cdidn\u2019t send anything or anyone at all\u201d to help them. There were extensive federal and state rescue and relief efforts in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Helene. It\u2019s true that some residents died and others were stranded for days, but the state was not ignored by Harris or the Biden administration; North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, has repeatedlythankedPresident Joe Biden for his assistance.Schools and transgender children: Trump told a slightly vaguer version of his usualfalse storyabout schools supposedly obtaining or performing gender-affirming surgeries for transgender children behind their parents\u2019 backs,saying, \u201cYour child go goes to school, and they take your child. It was a \u2018he.\u2019 And comes back a \u2018she.\u2019 And they do this\u2026And often without parental consent.\u201dThere is no evidence that US schools have sent children into gender-affirming surgeries without their parents knowing or performed gender-affirming surgeries on site; Trump\u2019s own presidential campaign could not provide a single example of any of this ever happening. Even in states wheregender-affirming surgeryis legal for people under age 18, parental consent\u00a0is required before a minor can undergo such a procedure.Trump\u2019s opponents and the election: In Reading, Trump falselyclaimedof his election opponents: \u201cThey are cheatin\u2019 dogs, I will tell you that.\u201d In Scranton, he falselyclaimed, \u201cTheir first meeting is: \u2018How do we cheat?\u2019\u201d This is all nonsense. There is no basis for the claim that Trump\u2019s opponents are election cheaters.Harris\u2019 previous presidential campaign: Trump repeated his falseclaimthat, when Harris ran for president in 2020, \u201cshe was the first one to drop out, of like 22 people\u201d in the Democratic primary. In fact, 13 other Democratic candidates dropped out of that primary before Harris exited in December 2019 \u2013 including\u00a0the\u00a0sitting\u00a0or former governors ofWashington,MontanaandColorado; the\u00a0sittingmayor of New York City;andsittingorformermembers of the House of Representatives andSenate.Harris and the press:Trump falselyclaimedof Harris: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t do any interviews.\u201d Trump is entitled to argue that Harris has not done a sufficient number of interviews as the Democratic presidential nominee, but the assertion she doesn\u2019t do \u201cany\u201d iswrong; Harris has done multiple interviews in recent weeks. Notably, Harris did an interview with the CBS News show \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which aired Monday, whileTrump backed outof his own interview with the show.Harris-Walz and the Supreme Court: After correctly noting that Harris\u2019 running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, recentlyexpressed supportfor getting rid of the Electoral College, Trump falselyclaimed, \u201cThey want to add\u2026 they\u2019re thinking about \u2013 first time I heard this number \u2013 25: they want to have 25 Supreme Court justices.\u201d There is no basis for the claim that Harris or Walz is pushing for a 25-justice Supreme Court.Walz and menstrual products in schools: TrumpdisparagedWalz as \u201cTampon Tim,\u201d then said, \u201cYou know why they call him that? \u2019Cause they sell tampons, with special legislation, in boys\u2019 locker rooms.\u201d Trump\u2019s claim is false. The law Walz signed in 2023 requires schools to provide free menstrual products in bathrooms, not the sale of menstrual products in locker rooms \u2013 and all 18 public school districts that responded to CNN\u2019s questions about the law say they do not provide the products in boys\u2019 bathrooms.

The Biden administration has made a push to get automakers to reduce emissions and adopt electric vehicles, but there is not a mandate for consumers; thetailpipe rulesfor automakers that were unveiled by the administration earlier this year aim to have electric vehicles make up 35% to 56% new vehicles sold in 2032.The Paris climate accord and emissions: Trumprepeatedhis false claim that under the Paris climate accord, the US \u201chad to pay a trillion dollars\u201d while some other countries didn\u2019t have to pay.Trump\u2019s \u201ctrillion\u201d figure is a wild exaggeration.Under the Obama administration,the US paid$1 billion of a $3 billion commitment it originally made in 2014. After Trump pulled the country out of the Paris accord, the US paid nothing to theglobal finance goal. And while Bidenpledged $11.4 billion annuallyfrom the US, this level of funding hasn\u2019t materialized. That\u2019s because Congress, responsible for appropriating the nation\u2019s budget, has allocated onlya fraction of that\u2013 roughly $1 billion in 2022.Harris\u2019 comments on fracking: Trump said, \u201cListen to Kamala in her own words very recently,\u201d then played two video clips in which Harris said she was in favor of banning fracking. But those clipsare from 2019, beyond any reasonable definition of \u201cvery recently.\u201d Harris hassaidduring the 2024 campaign that she no longer favors banning fracking.Venezuela, prisons and migration: Trump falselyclaimed, \u201cIn Venezuela, many countries, they\u2019re emptying their prisons into our country.\u201d This is false. Trump has never corroborated this claim about Venezuela, let alone \u201cmany countries,\u201d and experts have told CNN,PolitiFactandFactCheck.orgthat they know of no evidence for it.\u201cWe have no evidence that the Venezuelan government is emptying its prisons or mental health institutions to send them outside the country, in other words, to the U.S. or any other country,\u201d Roberto Brice\u00f1o-Le\u00f3n, founder and director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, an independent organization that tracks violence in the country, said in an email to CNN in June, after Trump made similar claims.Venezuela, criminals and migration: Adding another colorful story about Venezuela, Trump falselyclaimedthat \u201cthey take the criminal gangs from Caracas off the streets and they bus them into the United States and drop them.\u201d This is false. There is no evidence of Venezuelan authorities somehow busing gang members into the US.The world prison population: Trumprepeatedhis false claim that \u201cthe prison population all over the world is down, because they put them in our country.\u201d The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from at least about10.77 million peopleto at least about10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom.\u201cI do a daily news search to see what\u2019s going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,\u201dHelen Fair, co-author of the prison population list and research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London, said in June, when Trump made a similar claim.The number of migrants: Trump, speaking about migration, falselyclaimedthat \u201c21 million people \u2013 plus \u2013 came into our nation\u201d under the Biden-Harris administration.Through August, the country hadrecordedabout 10.3 million nationwide \u201cencounters\u201d with migrants during the Biden-Harris administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country; even adding in so-called \u201cgotaways\u201d who evaded detection,estimatedby House Republicans as being roughly 2 million, there\u2019s no way the total is \u201c21 million.\u201dHarris, migrants and criminals: Trump, criticizing Harris on immigration, againwrongly describeda set of statistics that was released in September. He falselyclaimedin Scranton, \u201cYou saw that last week: 13,099 murderers allowed to come in, through them.\u201d He falselyclaimedin Reading that \u201cas we speak she has \u2013 and this was just announced last week \u2013 13,099, so over 13,000 illegal alien convicted murderers, roaming free in our country.\u201dThis 13,099 figure includes people who are incarcerated in federal, state and local prisons and jails \u2013 and it includes people who entered the country over decades, including during Trump\u2019s administration, not just under Biden and Harris. You can read morehere.Harris\u2019 record as attorney general: Trump falselyclaimedthat when Harris was attorney general of California, \u201cshe said under no circumstances\u201d will people be prosecuted for the crimes of child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon or the rape of an unconscious person. Harris did not say anything like that; Trump was grossly mischaracterizing adebateover the language Harris\u2019 office used to summarize California ballot initiatives.Trump\u2019s border wall: Trumprepeatedhis false claim that \u201cI built over\u00a0500 miles of wall\u201d on the southern border. Official governmentdatashows 458 miles were built under Trump \u2013 including both wall built where no barriers had existed before and wall built to replace previous barriers.Trump\u2019s crowds: Trump falselyclaimedof his rallies: \u201cWe never have an empty seat.\u201d There have been empty seats atnumerous Trump ralliesover the years \u2013 includinghundreds at this very rallyin Reading. And at many Trump rallies, some once-filled seatsempty outduring his speeches when supporters leave.Trump\u2019s crowd in Butler: Trump falselyclaimedthere were \u201cover 100,000 people\u201d at therallyhe held Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, at the same site where a gunman had attempted to assassinate him in July. CNN affiliate KDKA in Pittsburghreportedthat the Secret Service put the crowd at 24,000 people, while the Trump-supporting sheriff of Blair County, Pennsylvania, James Ott,saidin his speech at the rally itself (more than three hours before Trump took the stage) that he was looking out at \u201c21,000-plus people.\u201dTrump\u2019s response to the assassination attempt: Trump, speaking of his response to the attempted assassination in July, falselyclaimed, \u201cI said as I was getting up \u2013 before\u00a0I even got up \u2013 I said, \u2018How many people were killed?\u2019 Because, you know, it was wall to wall people, and\u00a0I said, \u2018How many people were killed?\u2019 They said, \u2018We\u00a0think three, sir,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s not good.\u2019\u201dTrump\u2019s rally microphonepicked up what was saidby Trump and Secret Service agents while he was on the ground and just after, and he did not ask, before or after he got up, how many people were killed. It\u2019s possible he did so after he was whisked off stage (and, of course, possible he was genuinely misremembering what happened in such a traumatic moment).Trump and firefighters: Trump falselyclaimed, \u201cWe got the firefighters endorse us, you probably heard.\u201d But the actual recentnational newswas that the International Association of Firefighters had decided not to endorse any candidate in the race; while Trump is free to argue that this was a victory for him, given that the union endorsed Biden in 2020, it was not an actual endorsement. And while there were some people in the Scranton crowd holding \u201cScranton Firefighters for Trump\u201d signs, the Scranton chapter of the union also has not issued an endorsement. The president of the chaptertoldthe Scranton Times-Tribune that none of the people he saw holding the signs were active or retired local firefighters.Trump and classified documents: Speaking of the criminal case against him over his post-presidency retention of classified documents, Trumprepeatedhis false claim that \u201cI had the Presidential Records Act; I was totally\u00a0allowed to do it.\u201d ThePresidential Records Actsaysthat, the moment a president leaves office, the National Archives and Records Administration gets custody and control of all presidential records from their administration.\u00a0(Trump\u2019s case wasdismissedby a federal judge in July on other grounds, that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith was unconstitutional; Smith hasappealed.)The New York Times and the Russia investigation: Trump, calling claims about his 2016 campaign\u2019s connections to Russia a \u201cscam,\u201d repeated his false claim that The New York Times \u201cadmitted they were wrong\u201d about the coverage thatwon its journalists a Pulitzer Prizealong with journalists from The Washington Post.\u201cThe claim is completely false,\u201d Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander said in an email to CNNin 2023, when Trump made a similar claim; Stadtlander noted that \u201cthe award wasupheldby the Pulitzer Prize Board after an independent review\u201d and said the Times\u2019 reporting \u201cwas also substantiated by the Mueller investigation and Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into the matter.\u201dThe New York Times and the 2016 election: Trump repeated a false claim he made during his presidency,sayingof The New York Times\u2019 coverage of the 2016 election: \u201cRemember in 2016 they had to\u00a0do an editorial apologizing to their readers\u00a0because they said, \u2018He\u2019s going to lose\u2019\u2026and then I won?\u201dAs the Timesnotedin 2017 in response to such Trump claims, it did not apologize for its 2016 election coverage. It did publish a post-electionletter, from then-executive editor Dean Baquet and publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., that said the election had raised several questions, including this: \u201cDid Donald Trump\u2019s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?\u201d But the letter did not include an apology, to Trump or anyone else.Trump and the defeat of ISIS: Trump repeated his falseclaimthat \u201cwe defeated ISIS in four weeks; it was supposed to take four or five years.\u201d The ISIS \u201ccaliphate\u201d was declared fully liberatedmore than two yearsinto Trump\u2019s presidency.Military equipment surrendered to the Taliban: Trumprepeatedhis false claim that \u201cwe gave $85 billion worth\u201d of US military equipment to the Taliban. Trump\u2019s figure is a massive exaggeration; the Pentagon hasestimatedthat the equipment abandoned to the Taliban by Afghan forces upon their 2021 collapse was worth about $7.1 billion \u2013 a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021.Biden and foreign income: Trump repeated his falseclaimthat \u201cBiden got a lot of money from China.\u201d After years ofinvestigationby House Republicans, there is still no evidence Biden has received any Chinese money.Chris Wallace and a question about the Biden family: Trumptoldhisfamiliarfalse story about how he had asked Biden at a 2020 presidential debate why the wife of a mayor of Moscow had paid Biden $3.5 million \u2013 in fact, the money was sent to a firm connected to the president\u2019s son Hunter Biden, not to the president \u2013 but moderator Chris Wallace, then of Fox News and now of CNN, had interjected to say, \u201cWell, please don\u2019t ask him that question.\u201d Wallace never did that. As the transcriptshows, Wallace interjected during this debate exchange to try to get Trump to\u00a0allow\u00a0Biden to answer Trump\u2019s question about the payment, not to stop Trump from asking.Inflation: Trump repeated his falseclaimthat inflation under Biden and Harris is \u201cthe worst inflation in the history of our country.\u201d Trump could fairly say that the USinflation ratehit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the all-timerecordof23.7%, set in 1920, and the rate has since plummeted; the most recent available inflation rate at the time Trump spoke here was2.5%in August.Mortgage rates: Trump falselyclaimedthat young people can\u2019t buy a house because interest rates are higher than 10%: \u201cIt\u2019s not 10%, it\u2019s 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 percent.\u201d This is false. The average rate on a standard 30-year fixed mortgagewas 6.12%in the week ending October 3, according to mortgage financing provider Freddie Mac, and6.32%in the week ending October 10.Trump\u2019s tax cut: Trump repeated his falseclaimthat \u201cI gave you, as you know, the largest tax cut in the history of our country.\u201d Expert analyses havefoundthat his 2017 tax cut law was not the largest in US history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or in inflation-adjusted dollars.Tariffs on China: Trump repeated two of his regular false claims about tariffs on imported Chinese products. He falselyclaimedthat China \u201cpaid hundreds of billions of dollars\u201d in these tariffs during his presidency, then falselyclaimedthat before his presidency, \u201cnobody ever brought in 10 cents, not one other \u2013 not 10 cents, you check those records.\u201dWe\u2019ve checked, and the truth is that the US wasgenerating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on China before Trump took office; in fact, the US has had tariffs on Chinese imports since the 1700s. Second, US importers pay these tariffs, not China, andstudy after studyhas found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump\u2019s tariffs.The 1890s and tariffs: Touting the supposed benefits of tariffs, Trump falselyclaimedthat in the 1890s, when the UShad very high tariffs, \u201cOur country was the richest it ever was.\u201d The US is far richer today than in the 1890s; per capita gross domestic product isnow many times higherthan it was then.The trade deficit with China: Trumprepeatedhisfrequent false claimthat the US trade deficit with China has averaged \u201c$500 billion\u201d per year. The US hasnever\u00a0had a $500 billiontrade deficit with China even if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade in which the US traditionally runs a surplus with China; the all-time record, about $418 billion, was set under Trump in 2018.Harris and taxes: Trumpplayeda deceptively editedvideoshowing \u201cThe View\u201d co-host Meghan McCain saying to Harris in 2019, \u201cEverything from a 70 to 80% tax rate,\u201d and Harris responding, \u201cI think that\u2019s fantastic.\u201dThis video cuts out key words from theexchange; Harris was not specifically endorsing high tax rates when she made the \u201cfantastic\u201d comment.Here\u2019s the transcript of the 2019 exchange:McCain: \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the party. She officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi. She wason \u201860 Minutes\u2019 this weekendproudly calling herself a radical. And she\u2019s promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car, should be eliminated within the next 11 years, everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. Do you agree that she could possibly \u2013 and this ideology, of the socialist left \u2013 could splinter your party?\u201dHarris: \u201cNo. You know, I think that she is challenging the status quo. I think that\u2019s fantastic. I think that \u2013 you know, I used to teach, before, especially before \u2013 in the last few years \u2013 and the thing that I always loved about teaching was when you teach, it requires you to defend the premise. And it requires you to re-examine the premise. And question, is it still relevant? Is it \u2013 does it have impact? Does it have meaning? And I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. And I think it\u2019s good for the party, I frankly think it\u2019s good for the country. Let\u2019s look at the bold ideas. And I\u2019m eager that we have those discussions. And when we are able to defend status quo, then do it, and if there are \u2013 you know, if there\u2019s not merit to that, then let\u2019s explore new ideas.\u201dBiden\u2019s documents case: Trump falselyclaimedin Reading that, in an investigation into Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents, \u201cBiden was essentially convicted\u201d and in Scrantonthat\u201cthey ruled on him, they said he\u2019s guilty.\u201d Biden was not convicted, \u201cessentially\u201d or not, and was not found guilty; in fact, Biden was not even charged with a crime. The special counsel in the case, Robert Hur,wrotein his public report that \u201cthe evidence does not establish Mr. Biden\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d adding that \u201cseveral defenses are likely to create reasonable doubt as to such charges.\u201dA supposed Biden gaffe: Mocking Biden\u2019s gaffes, Trump falselyclaimed, \u201cBut the worst was when he was in New Hampshire and he said, \u2018It\u2019s great to be in Florida.\u2019 That\u2019s palm trees.\u201d This never happened. Biden has certainly made various geographic gaffes, ashasTrump, but he never said he was in Florida when he was actually in New Hampshire."}, {"title": "Fact check: Six days of Trump lies about the Hurricane Helene\u00a0response", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/06/politics/fact-check-trump-helene-response-north-carolina/index.html", "content": "WashingtonCNN\u2014Former President Donald Trump has delivered a barrage of lies and distortions about the federal response to Hurricane Helene.While variousmisinformationabout the responsehas spread widely without Trump\u2019s involvement, the Republican presidential nominee has been one of the country\u2019s leading deceivers on the subject. Over a span of six days, in public comments and social media posts, Trump has used his powerful megaphone to endorse or invent false or unsubstantiated claims.The chief targets of his hurricane-related dishonesty have been Vice President Kamala Harris, his opponent in the November presidential election, and President Joe Biden.Monday: Trump falsely claims Biden hasn\u2019t answered calls from Georgia\u2019s governorDuring a visit to Georgia on Monday, Trumpsaidof Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp: \u201cHe\u2019s been calling the president, hasn\u2019t been able to get him.\u201dIt was immediately clear that Trump\u2019s claim was false. Kemp, a Republican,told reportersearlier Monday that he had spoken with Biden the day prior \u2014 and that it was Kemp who had initially missed a call from Biden, not the other way around.Kemp told reporters that he had successfully called Biden right back. Kemp added: \u201cHe just said, \u2018Hey, what do you need?\u2019 And I told him, you know, \u2018We got what we need. We\u2019ll work through the federal process.\u2019 He offered that if there\u2019s other things we need, just to call him directly, which \u2014 I appreciate that.

Though the Biden administration\u2019s response had certainly received criticism, it had also been praised by various state and local leaders \u2014 including theRepublicangovernorsof some of the affected states and the Democratic governor of North Carolina, plus local leaders including the Democratic mayor of the hard-hit North Carolina city of Asheville.For example, Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMastersaidat a Tuesday press conference that federal assistance had \u201cbeen superb,\u201d noting that Biden and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had both called and told him to let them know whatever the state needed. McMaster also said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell had called.Thursday: Trump falsely claims Harris spent \u2018all her FEMA money\u2019 on housing illegal migrantsAt a campaign rally in Michigan on Thursday, Trumpclaimedthat \u201cKamala spent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal migrants, many of whom should not be in our country.\u201d He added in an election-related conspiracy theory,saying, \u201cThey stole the FEMA money, just like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them this season.\u201dThis is false.First, there is zero basis for Trump\u2019s suggestion that the Biden administration is running some sort of scheme to get undocumented immigrants to vote illegally in the 2024 election. Voting by noncitizens is a felony.Second, there is zero basis for claiming that FEMA disaster assistance money was stolen \u2014 by anyone, let alone Harris personally \u2014 for the housing of migrants.Congress appropriated $650 million in the 2024 fiscal year to fund aprogramthat helps state and local governments house migrants \u2014 andinstructedUS Customs and Border Protection to transfer that $650 million to FEMA to administer the program. But this $650 million pot isentirely distinctfrom FEMA\u2019s pot of disaster relief funds; as theDepartment of Homeland Security,the White Houseand independent observers noted this week, they\u2019re just two separate things funded separately by Congress.Congress appropriated more than $35 billion in disaster relief funds for fiscal 2024, according toofficial FEMA statistics.Friday: Trump falsely claims $1 billion was \u2018stolen\u2019 from FEMA for migrants and has gone \u2018missing\u2019Though Trump\u2019s Thursday claim about FEMA money and migrants had already been debunked by Friday, Trumprepeated the claim to reportersat leasttwiceon Friday\u00a0\u2014 and then said itagainat a Friday night town hall event in North Carolina.Saturday: Trump falsely claims the federal government is only giving $750 to people who lost their homesAt a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Trump strongly suggested that Americans who lost their homes in the hurricane were only being offered $750 in federal aid.\u201cThey\u2019re offering them $750, to people whose homes have been washed away. And yet we send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of. They\u2019re offering them $750. They\u2019ve been destroyed, these people have been destroyed,\u201d Trumpsaid. He added, \u201cThink of it: We give foreign countries hundreds of billions of dollars and we\u2019re handing North Carolina $750.\u201dTrump\u2019s claim is wrong. As FEMA explained earlier in the weekon social mediaandon a web pageit created to combat misinformation about the response, $750 is merely theimmediate, upfrontaid survivors can get to cover basic, pressing needs like food, water, baby formula and emergency supplies. Survivors are also eligible to apply for additional forms of assistance, such as to pay for temporary housing and home repairs, that can be worth thousands of dollars; thecurrent maximum amount for home repair assistance, for example, is $42,500.During Harris\u2019 visit to Georgia on Wednesday, shesaid, \u201cAnd the federal relief and assistance that we have been providing has included FEMA providing $750 for folks who need immediate needs being met, such as food, baby formula, and the like.\u00a0And you can apply now.\u201d But she added just moments later,\u00a0\u201cFEMA is also providing tens of thousands more dollars for folks to help them be able to deal with home repair, to be able to cover a deductible when and if they have insurance, and also hotel costs.\u201dIt\u2019s also worth noting that this hurricane-related assistance to individual residents is separate from the hurricane-related assistance the federal government will provide to state governments. For example, the federal transportation departmentannounced Saturdaythat it was immediately providing $100 million to North Carolina\u2019s transportation department \u201cto help pay for the costs of immediate emergency work resulting from Hurricane Helene flood damage.\u201d Buttigieg added that this emergency funding \u201cwill be followed by additional federal resources.\u201dSaturday: Trump falsely claims there are \u2018no helicopters, no rescue\u2019 in North CarolinaTrump, criticizing Harris forparticipating ina political fundraising event in California the last weekend of September,saidat the Saturday rally in Pennsylvania: \u201cKamala wined and dined in San Francisco, and all of the people in North Carolina \u2014 no helicopters, no rescue \u2014 it\u2019s just \u2014 what\u2019s happened there is very bad.\u201dThis claim about North Carolina is false. There have been numerous government and private helicopters and other aircraft involved in rescue and aid efforts in North Carolina, though some residents died before they could be rescued and a significant number of residents haveremained missing or stranded for days.The North Carolina National Guardannounced Thursdaythat its own air assets had \u201ccompleted 146 flight missions, resulting in the rescue of 538 people and 150 pets.\u201d\u00a0 The Washington Postreported Friday: \u201cThe drone of helicopters has become routine across western North Carolina in the wake of Helene.\u00a0National Guard and civilian aircraft now crisscross the skies of a region where roads and bridges have been destroyed and people are trapped. The helicopters are delivering supplies, picking up people who need rescuing, dropping off firefighters and search-and-rescue crews and radioing for assistance for others who can be more easily accessed from the ground.\u201cCNNreported Saturdaythat air traffic over western North Carolina had increased 300% over the past seven days due to hurricane relief efforts, according to Becca Gallas, director of North Carolina\u2019s Division of Aviation.\u00a0The statesaidin an official update Saturday: \u201cA total of 53 search and rescue teams from North Carolina and beyond, consisting of more than 1,600 personnel have conducted search and rescue operations during this event. Search and rescue teams have interacted with over 5,400 people, including assists, evacuations and rescues.\u201d"}, {"title": "House Republicans attempt to avoid 2022 letdown with new tactic on abortion: \u2018We\u2019re both pro-choice\u2019", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/house-republicans-abortion-strategy-elections/index.html", "content": "For more on the House Republican strategy on abortion issues, watch CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics with Manu Raju,\u201d this Sunday at 8 a.m. ET.\ufeffWashingtonCNN\u2014Republicans in the nation\u2019s toughest House districts are making a major pivot on abortion with a surprising result \u2014 they\u2019re starting to sound like Democrats.GOP candidates in suburbs of places like Tucson, Des Moines and Syracuse are going public with vows never to criminalize abortion or support a national ban. Some are going further: Rep.John Duarteof California\u2019s Central Valley, Rep. Tom Kean Jr. in northern New Jersey and GOP candidate Matt Gunderson in the San Diego area have all described themselves as \u201cpro choice\u201d \u2014 with the latter even speaking directly to camera in his first TV ad and borrowing Bill Clinton\u2019s phrase calling for the procedure to be \u201csafe, legal and rare.\u201dIn this fall\u2019s toss-up battle for the House, swing-seat Republicans are carefully rebranding themselves on abortion after largely failing to respond to relentless Democratic attacks that cost the GOP big last cycle. And they\u2019re attempting to neutralize the Democrats\u2019 most potent attack \u2014 all in an effort to turn voters\u2019 attention to the US-Mexico border and other galvanizing issues.\u201cSince we\u2019re both pro-choice, then we have an opportunity to take that conversation, set it aside and have a real serious conversation about solving the border, about inflation, the economy, jobs, crime, education,\u201d Gunderson said in an interview, referring to his opponent, Democratic Rep. Mike Levin.It may be easier said than done.Even as swing-seat Republicans attempt to paint a more nuanced view of the GOP\u2019s stance on abortion, the national party has often muddled that message. In recent days, former first lady Melania Trump disclosed she supports the right to an abortion \u201cfree from any intervention\u201d \u2014 while Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, took the staunchly conservative position of vowing to defund Planned Parenthood.And it all underscores a critical weakness for the GOP fewer than 30 days from the election. The party still struggles to respond to an issue that makes up the vast majority of Democratic attacks this cycle: 80% of spending on TV ads by the House Democrats\u2019 two main groups went to ads focusing on abortion. And it\u2019s been particularly effective against GOP incumbents with well-documented comments on abortion \u2014 like Rep. Zach Nunn of Iowa \u2014 that Democrats have turned into attack ads.\u201cYou can\u2019t hide from it,\u201d said Rep. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican from North Dakota, reflecting on the lessons Republicans learned in the 2022 midterms. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really have a plan for what had happened.\u201dDemocrats say their foes\u2019 efforts to show a softer side on abortion won\u2019t work.\u201cHe\u2019s going to probably say anything he needs to say to try to win and see what sticks,\u201d Levin, a three-term Democrat who cut an ad responding to Gunderson, told CNN.\u201cWe know that if Mike Johnson is empowered, that there are many around here that would try to get a national abortion ban in place,\u201d Levin said, even as his opponent said he\u2019d oppose both a national ban and a bill to codify Roe, saying the issue should be left up to the states.Behind closed doors, Republican leaders have spent months working with battleground candidates, particularly in New York and California, to sell a more moderate message on the issue. The House GOP campaign chief, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, has advised fellow Republicans to clearly articulate their views \u2014 or face globs of Democratic spending to distort their position.And they\u2019ve been far more aggressive in calling out some misleading Democratic ads, which have accused Republican candidates of supporting strict abortion bans or opposing exceptions for abortion even when that candidate is on the record with a more moderate position. In some cases, like in pivotal seats inNorth CarolinaandVirginia, fact-checkers have agreed.Hudson accused Democrats of \u201ccreating a false and distorted impression\u201d of the GOP\u2019s abortion position in the 2022 midterms and attacked Democrats for espousing their own \u201cextreme\u201d views on the issue.\u201cTo fight back, we have encouraged our candidates to be open, direct and empathetic about their position \u2013 and nonpartisan fact-checkers have responded, picking apart a litany of Democratic attack ads for telling blatant lies,\u201d Hudson told CNN.Sarah Chamberlain, who runs the centrist-leaning Republican Mainstreet Partnership, recalled warning a prominent GOP pollster the day of the\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0Supreme Court decision that it would be a huge issue for women voters. He initially told her she was wrong, but phoned her after the midterms to admit his miscalculation. Since then, Chamberlain has used her own polling to help convince key swing-seat House Republicans to shift their approach.\u201cDon\u2019t use the \u2018A word.\u2019 Talk about it as women\u2019s health care,\u201d Chamberlain said. \u201cThe economy, immigration \u2014 there\u2019s tons of things we can win on and should win on. But this issue is still very strong.\u201dDemocrats cry hypocrisyIn some cases, Republicans are trying to walk back \u2014 or completely abandon \u2014 their past anti-abortion rights views.When he first ran for Congress in 2022 for a seat in Washington state, GOP candidate Joe Kenttold a local news station: \u201cI would move to have a national ban on abortion.\u201dThis time, Kentfilmed an adstating: \u201cI oppose any new federal legislation on the issue.\u201dKent\u2019s opponent \u2014 Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez \u2014 called out his shifting position in a recentcandidate debate, accusing him of playing \u201cboth sides of this card\u201d and saying \u201cwhat the pollsters tell him to say.\u201dAnd he\u2019s not the only one whose public position has changed. Nunn, the endangered Republican in Iowa, is fighting for his political survival as Democrats devote a majority of their TV ads to the issue in this suburban battleground.Nunn\u2019s Democratic opponent, Lanon Baccam, hasattacked the GOP incumbentwith a clip from the Republican primary debate in 2022 when Nunn raised his hand to say all abortions should be illegal in the country. Nunn has not responded to the issue of abortion on air.And in the key California race to hold Levin\u2019s seat, the main Democratic super PAC \u2014 House Majority PAC \u2014 has reserved $1.5 million to begin next week in an effort to target Gunderson. Abortion attacks are expected to be part of the mix.Levin has seized on Gunderson\u2019s opposition to a 2022 California abortion rights referendum, which the Republican previously referred to as \u201cdisgusting\u201d in a meeting with voters.\u201cWhat I did say was that late-term abortion is disgusting,\u201d Gunderson told CNN when asked about those remarks, arguing the referendum \u201copened up a Pandora\u2019s box to late-term abortion.\u201dDemocratic leaders say Republicans are trying to muddy the waters.\u201cThis is a desperation move by Republicans,\u201d said House Democrats\u2019 campaign chief, Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state. \u201cPeople know where they stand.\u201dPro-women language but unclear on specificsIn 2022, Democrats dumped a half-billion dollars\u2019 worth of abortion attacks into pivotal races and helped prevent a GOP wave. This time, Republicans, like freshman Rep. Marc Molinaro, who is defending a tough upstate New York seat, are looking to take that issue off the table for Democrats.Molinaro was one of the first Republicans this cycle to launch a TV ad devoted solely to his stance on abortion.\u201cI believe in supporting all women and the choices they make,\u201d Molinaro says, speaking into the camera, in the ad.But even as he has sought to counter Democratic attacks, he hasn\u2019t been entirely clear on what positions he does support. While the New York Republican touted support for \u201cbroad access\u201d to birth control and blocking efforts to ban mifepristone in an interview, he didn\u2019t offer a clear answer when asked if he supports restoring\u00a0Roe\u00a0or if he considers himself \u201cpro choice.\u201d\u201cI describe it as somebody who says that the decision and the choice on reproductive health is between you and your physician. Immaterial of anything else, that\u2019s what I believe,\u201d Molinaro told CNN. As for his decision to speak up on abortion, Molinaro added: \u201cI think it\u2019s important that people see me explain to them that I respect the choice they make and that they have my support.\u201dHe isn\u2019t the only Republican looking to keep their distance from the Dobbs decision.Duarte, the vulnerable California Republican, refused to say if he supports the 2022 decision that struck down Roe.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s done. It\u2019s in the rearview mirror,\u201d Duarte told CNN. \u201cAnd the fact is that abortion is back in the states where it belongs.\u201dAnd the congressman contended that his position \u2014 and Trump\u2019s position \u2014 that the matter should be left up to the states is effectively pro-abortion rights.\u201cI am pro-choice,\u201d Duarte said, arguing that Trump is even \u201cfunctionally pro-choice,\u201d though the former president regularly boasts about appointing three Supreme Court justices who struck down Roe and plans to vote against a Florida abortion rights referendum this fall.Another battleground Republican, Rep. Juan Ciscomani of southern Arizona, went up with his own TV ad this fall saying he opposes a federal abortion ban and supports abortion in the cases of certain exceptions, such as protecting the life of the mother.In adebatethis week, Ciscomani added that he also opposed his state\u2019s Civil War-era ban on nearly all abortions, which was recently repealed. But he didn\u2019t say how he\u2019ll vote this November on his state\u2019s ballot measure to enshrine rights to an abortion up to the point of viability, saying only that it was a state issue.And when asked about what he was trying to sell to voters with his ad, Ciscomani simply said: \u201cMy position.\u201d"}, {"title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/politics/senate-race-rankings-october-2024/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014With just over a month until Election Day, the same competitive races continue to dominate the Senate landscape, but there are a few significant changes to the order of CNN\u2019s ranking of the seats most likely to flip.And in the final weeks, the degree to which these 10 races \u2013 which are mostly playing out in statesDonald Trumpeither won or narrowly lost in 2020 \u2013 move in the same direction as the presidential contest will likely determine which party wins control of the Senate.Republican Senate candidate for Montana Tim Sheehy walks up to the stage during a rally for Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump at the Brick Breeden Fieldhouse at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana, on August 9, 2024.Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images/FileRelated articleHow the Senate GOP\u2019s potential majority maker is staying \u2018shielded\u2019 in push to oust Tester in MontanaRepublicans \u2013 who are virtually a lock to pick up the West Virginia seat and would need to either win the White House or pick up one more seat for the majority \u2013 have an incentive to nationalize many of their targeted races. Well-funded Democratic incumbents, for the most part, are touting statewide and local accomplishments and their support for abortion rights.Two states that are part of the Democratic \u201cblue wall\u201d \u2013 and also key White House battlegrounds \u2013 move up on this month\u2019s rankings, which are based on reporting, as well as fundraising, polling and advertising data. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are now in the middle of the pack of flippable seats, along with Michigan, which remains at No. 4.The oddity of this year\u2019s fight for the Senate is that Democrats have consistently led in the public polling of key races, but it\u2019s Republicans who are poised to gain seats and, potentially, control of the chamber.That\u2019s a reflection of the Senate map \u2013 but also increasingly some post-Labor Day tightening as GOP spending picks up and voters get to know their candidates. Still, no public general election polling that meets CNN standards has shown the Republican nominee ahead in any of the seats that Democrats are defending, save for West Virginia.And two GOP targets \u2013 Arizona and Nevada \u2013 are moving down the list because Republicans have not kept the races as competitive as elsewhere.Earlier this year, those two states were Nos. 4 and 5.

DSCC Chairman Gary Peters has insisted that this is extra spending that won\u2019t take money away from their defensive priorities.

Deb Fischer has prompted the National Republican Senatorial Committee to start spending here, and elections analysts have moved the race out of the solid Republican category.There remain lots of unknowns in Nebraska, but we\u2019ll be watching to see how that race \u2013 and the 10 others \u2013 develop over the next month.1. West VirginiaSen. Joe ManchinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/FileWest Virginia is essentially out of reach for Democrats, who had little chance of holding this seat without Sen. Joe Manchin running for reelection. Manchin, now an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is likely to be succeeded by Republican Jim Justice, the state\u2019s two-term governor.Justice has had his share of negative headlines, but in a state poised to back Trump by a significant margin, it\u2019s hard to see a world in which Republicans don\u2019t pick up this open seat.2. MontanaSen. Jon TesterAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileDemocrat Jon Tester, who\u2019s running for a fourth term in a state Trump has twice carried by double digits, remains the most vulnerable Senate incumbent this year. Republicans feel confident their nominee,Tim Sheehy, has an edge \u2013 and both Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales and the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter have shifted their rating of the once toss-up race toward the GOP.Democrats still see a path to victory for Tester, who has a proven history of defying the partisan lean of his state by communicating both what he\u2019s done for Montanans and painting a contrast with his opponents.Democrats are trying that playbook against Sheehy, trying to define the wealthy businessman and retired Navy SEAL, who moved to Montana in 2014, as an out-of-state carpetbagger who cannot be trusted. Recentlyunearthed audio recordingsof Sheehy using racist stereotypes to refer to Native Americans has played into that message, with Democrats arguing that he\u2019s alienating a crucial demographic in the state. In a debate earlier this week, Sheehy acknowledged his comments were \u201cinsensitive,\u201d saying, \u201cI come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color sometimes.\u201dTester\u2019s campaign is now leaning into abortion rights on the airwaves \u2013 an issue that\u2019s on the ballot in Montana this year. Arecent adfeatures a self-described \u201clife-long\u201d Republican woman arguing that Sheehy \u201cwants to take away personal freedoms.\u201dBut Republicans are invoking transgender issues in an attempt to cast Tester as a liberal who\u2019s been changed by his years in Washington, while Sheehy istrying to tie Tester to KamalaHarris\u2013 especially on immigration. Tester \u2013 who has not endorsed in the presidential race \u2013 tried to meet those attacks during their debate by pointing out that Sheehy would not have supported this year\u2019s bipartisan border bill that Republicans blocked.3. OhioSen. Sherrod BrownBonnie Cash/Getty Images/FileDemocratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing his toughest reelection in a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 points. Public polling still shows the three-term senator ahead of GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, although that is expected to tighten as more Republican voters come home to Moreno. Brown was at 47% to Moreno\u2019s 43% in a late SeptemberNew York Times/Siena College pollamong likely Ohio voters \u2013 not far outside the margin of error. But the reassuring news for Democrats: Brown was winning 10% of Trump voters.Democrats have seized on Moreno\u2019s recent comments at a town hall suggesting that some suburban women were single-issue voters when it comes to abortion and questioning why women over 50 would care about the topic. Brown pointed to the remarks as evidence that his opponent is out of step with the 57% of Ohio voters who last year approved a ballot measure protecting reproductive rights. WinSenate, a Democratic outside group, also launcheda new adwith a woman talking about the emergency abortion she underwent at 25 for an ectopic pregnancy, saying, \u201cOur lives don\u2019t belong in Bernie Moreno\u2019s hands.\u201d(Moreno\u2019s campaign said in a statement that he was \u201cclearly making a tongue-in-cheek joke about how Sherrod Brown and members of the leftwing media like to pretend that the only issue that matters to women voters is abortion,\u201d and that Moreno believes women \u201ccare just as much about the economy, rising prices, crime and our open southern border as male voters do.\u201d)The Senate contest in Ohio ranked as the most expensive congressional race on record, as of October 3, with total ad spending from both parties this cycle, including future reservations, exceeding $446 million, according to AdImpact. Brown \u2013 who announced raising $30.6 million in the third quarter \u2013 has continued totouthis work to pass the PACT Act to help veterans exposed to burn pits, while Morenotries to nationalizethe race by tying Brown to Harris and inflation and linking himself to Trump.

Debbie StabenowAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileMichigan remains the most competitive open seat on this list. Democrat Elissa Slotkin has held a narrow edge in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, but the absence of an incumbent and the competitiveness of the presidential race in the Wolverine State\u00a0makes it one that could come down to the wire.Slotkin, a third-term congresswoman, led Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers 47% to 42% among likely voters in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll, with Slotkin drawing 6% of likely voters who also said they would vote for Trump. Slotkin has a strong fundraising record \u2013 her campaign announced raising $18 million in the third quarter \u2013 but Republicans are pouring more money into this state, with the Senate Leadership Fund recently announcing a $22.5 million investment.Slotkin has been runningads on abortion\u2013 an issue that has helped propel recent Democratic victories in the state. Herspotsclaim that Rogers\u2019 past support for abortion restrictions makes him untrustworthy on the issue now. \u201cI\u2019m scared that Mike Rogers will continue to take away my rights,\u201d says one woman in a spot who says she needed an abortion to save her life.Rogers has been responding on air, speaking directly to camera while holding hands with his wife inone new spot,saying he respects Michigan voters\u2019 decision on abortion rights and \u201cwon\u2019t do anything to change it\u201d in the Senate.Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, scored the endorsement of the state Farm Bureau\u2019s PAC, which had previously backed Stabenow (the chair of the Senate Agriculture panel). Rogers, whom Democrats have attacked for living in Florida after he left Congress a decade ago, is runningspotsthat tout his Michigan roots and public service. Rogers and Republicans are alsoattacking Slotkinandthe Biden administrationover plans to support the building of electric vehicles, using the misleading term \u201cmandate.\u201d5. PennsylvaniaSen. Bob CaseyAndrew Harnik/Getty ImagesDemocratic Sen. Bob Casey\u2019s race against Republican challenger Dave McCormick moves two spots up on the list in light of heavy GOP outside spending, some tighter polling and the competitiveness of the presidential race in a\u00a0state that is part of Democrats\u2019 so-called blue wall of must-win states.September polling from Marist, Quinnipiac University, the New York Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer, Franklin & Marshall, CBS News/YouGov and Fox News all gave Casey anywhere from a 5- to 9-point lead among likely voters. Polls from CNN and The Washington Post around the same time, however, showed no clear leader.The two candidates, who met on the debate stage for the first time Thursday night, have been hitting the airwaves with competing messages, as have their allied outside groups. Democrats are going after McCormick onabortion,includingonead that features footage of him referring to himself as \u201cpro-life.\u201d The Senate Leadership Fund, which is adding $28 million to GOP sending here, and the pro-McCormickKeystone Renewal PAChave been attacking Casey over inflation andimmigration.McCormick\u2019s tenure as the CEO of FreeMarkets \u2013 a Pittsburgh-based software company \u2013 has also been featured in ads on both sides.The Democratic group WinSenateis accusing him ofoutsourcing jobsand pointing to his management of the company to argue that \u201cConnecticut Dave\u201d\u00a0 \u2013 he owns a home in the Nutmeg State \u2013 \u201cwants to buy our Senate seat.\u201d McCormick is running ads featuringformer FreeMarkets employeespraising him and touting the company\u2019s hiring policies.6. WisconsinSen. Tammy BaldwinMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesWisconsin also moves up two spots on the list amid signs that some Republicans could be drifting home toward their party\u2019s nominee, Eric Hovde, in his challenge to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.The two-term senator maintained a modest edge over Hovde in aMarquette University Law School pollreleased this week \u2013 51% to 45% among likely voters when third-party candidates are included and 53% to 46% in a head-to-head matchup. Baldwin had a similar 7-point lead in aNew York Times/Siena College surveyof the two-person race\u00a0taken around the same time.While Baldwin has repeatedly outraised Hovde, the Senate Leadership Fund is also pouring funds \u2013 $17 million \u2013 into the Badger State, and Hovde has plenty of his own money to pay for ads at the lower candidate rate if he chooses. (We\u2019ll be eying his third-quarter fundraising filing for details about how much the Sunwest Bank CEO had loaned his campaign through September.) Ads from Hovde \u2013 whose campaign recently underwent a shakeup \u2013 havesought to tie Baldwinto Harris, attacking her over border security, fentanyl andtransgender rights.But Baldwin, who\u2019s made an effort tovisit the red, rural parts of Wisconsin, has a well-defined brand. She picked up theendorsementof the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation this week \u2013 a notable get for a Democrat running statewide. Much of Democratic advertising has played up Hovde\u2019s past controversial comments and sought to cast him as a California carpetbagger \u2013 he owns property in Laguna Beach, even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin and his family\u2019s company is a prominent state brand.7. ArizonaSen. Kyrsten SinemaAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileArizona is a conservative-leaning purple state, where Republicans should ordinarily be able to pick off a Senate seat \u2013 especially an open one. But in the race to replace retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, Republican candidate Kari Lake seems to have hit a ceiling.The 2022 gubernatorial nominee is well known in the state, but not necessarily for the right reasons. She still refuses to accept her loss for governor and, despite tethering herself to Trump, is underperforming his polling numbers.Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego led Lake by 10 points among likely voters in aMarist polland 13 points in aFox News survey, both from mid-September. Lake was polling behind Trump in both surveys by 6 points and 8 points respectively.Lake and the NRSC areblaming Gallegofor inflation and immigration \u2013 pointing to his support for what they\u2019re calling the \u201cKamala Inflation Act.\u201d (Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.) And while the Senate Leadership Fund hasn\u2019t spent here, a Club for Growth-affiliated group is also airingattackson the congressman. Gallego, a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was on the airwaves for months introducing himself to voters statewide as a Marine veteran and istouting his supportfrom law enforcement andRepublican voters. He announced raising $21.7 million in the third quarter.8. NevadaSen. Jacky RosenAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileNevada moves down two spots on the list as Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen appears to be in a stronger position against Republican opponent Sam Brown in a state where Democratic prospects seem to have picked up since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.Rosen, who appeared at a Harris rally in Las Vegas earlier this week, led Brown by 10 points in aCNN pollin late August. Like Lake in Arizona, Brown \u2013 an Army veteran who first ran for office in Texas and lost the GOP primary for Nevada\u2019s other Senate seat last year \u2013 also appears to be running up against a ceiling.Rosen and Democrats are hitting Brownover his previous stances on abortion\u2013 which is on the ballot this year in Nevada. Brown, who says he supports current state law legalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks, has said he\u2019d \u201cclose the door\u201d on backing a national abortion ban.Rosen has had a fundraising edge over her opponent, and this week, national Republicans canceled their remaining independent expenditures in the state in favor of running hybrid ads with Brown, which allows them to benefit from the lower candidate rate in the ultra-pricey Las Vegas media market \u2014 a strategy they\u2019ve employed in races across the country to try to compete with well-funded Democratic candidates on the airwaves.9. TexasSen. Ted CruzTierney L. Cross/Getty Images/FileNational Democrats\u2019 decision toinvest TV resourcesin Texas was the first major signal the party is putting money where its mouth is on the competitiveness of the Lone Star State this year. Democrats see Republican Sen. Ted Cruz as unpopular and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred, as the man to beat him, even in a state that is still comfortably red at the presidential level.The first hybridadbetween Allred and the DSCC features Kate Cox, the woman who had to leave the state to seek an abortion after her fetus had been diagnosed with a deadly condition, and Amanda Zurawski, who sued the state after she was denied an abortion when experiencing complications. \u201cIf you\u2019re experiencing pregnancy complications in Texas, you\u2019re in danger,\u201d Zurawski says in the ad, \u201cand it\u2019s Ted Cruz and the anti-abortion extremists\u2019 fault.\u201dAllred has also tried to flip the script on Republicans byaccusing Cruzof \u201cdoing nothing to secure the border.\u201d Cruz, in turn, isattacking Allredover a vote related to the inclusion of transgender athletes in women\u2019s sports. \u201cBoys and girls are different,\u201d is how anotheradfrom the Republican opens. \u201cThis election is about keeping Texas Texas,\u201d Cruz has said.Cruz only beat Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke by 3 points in 2018. But Democrats hope that Allred, a former NFL player who flipped a Dallas-area House seat the same year, is a more formidable challenger and can turn out more minority voters. (Allred would be the state\u2019s first Black senator if he wins.)Even Republicans acknowledge that Allred is running a good race, and the NRSC is investing here to help Cruz and the state party. Still, Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, so this remains an uphill battle for Allred.10. MarylandSen. Ben CardinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/GettyImages/FileThe race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin remains in tenth place this month as Angela Alsobrooks fights to keep this seat in party hands. Joe Biden won Maryland by 33 points in 2020, but Republican nominee Larry Hogan \u2013 a popular former two-term governor \u2013 has a supportive super PAC committing $18 million to tout hisindependence.Alsobrooks, the Prince George\u2019s County executive, led Hogan by 11 points in a recentWashington Post/University of Maryland poll. She\u2019s become better known statewide and has made gains among voters who say they care about Democrats maintaining control of the Senate. The argument that Hogan would be another vote for Senate Republicans has been Democrats\u2019central pitchin deep-blue Maryland, especially onabortion rightsand Trump.Voters in the Post survey were split over whether Hogan would back his party\u2019s leaders in the Senate. He\u2019s winning nearly half of independents, as well as 18% of Democrats. And as he tries to combat Democratic attacks over abortion rights, he\u2019s run ads about being\u201cthe ultimate girl dad\u201dand \u201cone of the few Republicans who never caved\u201d to Trump. Hogan rejected the former president\u2019s endorsement earlier this year, but Democrats quickly seized on Trump saying that he\u2019d like to see Hogan win.Maryland\u2019s Future, the super PAC backing Hogan, is trying to localize the race byattacking Alsobrooksfor improperly taking advantage of tax breaks she did not qualify for, as firstreported by CNN. (Her senior adviser told CNN that she was unaware of the problem and that her attorneys are working with both the District of Columbia and Prince George\u2019s County to resolve the issue.)CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report."}, {"title": "How the Senate GOP\u2019s potential majority maker is staying \u2018shielded\u2019 in push to oust Tester in Montana", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/03/politics/montana-senate-race-tester-sheehy/index.html", "content": "For more on the US Senate race in Montana, watch CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics with Manu Raju\u201d this Sunday at 8 a.m. ET.\ufeff\ufeffBozeman, MontanaCNN\u2014Tim Sheehy stumped behind closed doors earlier this week here with a crowd of supporters eager to make him the GOP\u2019s Senate majority maker.But the 38-year-old political novice was also eager not to be seen outside those doors.Sheehy and his campaign have gone to extreme lengths to avoid press scrutiny as he seeks to ride former President Donald Trump\u2019s coattails and tap into a reddening Montana to oust the three-term Democratic incumbent, Sen. Jon Tester, in November.Sheehy rarely grants interviews to local or national press, while his campaign doesn\u2019t discuss his schedule or provide information about his events, which tend to be closed affairs.And after CNN was turned away from the Bozeman event this week, after learning about it through sources, his campaign orchestrated his departure to try to deny a TV camera from getting footage of him leaving \u2013 going as far as dispatching a pickup truck to block the camera in order to let Sheehy leave without being seen in another vehicle.Once it was all said and done, Sheehy boasted about the event on X, writing that it was a \u201cstanding room only\u201d crowd.It all underscores a\u00a0critical moment in one of the nation\u2019s marquee Senate races: Sheehy stands a favorite to win, thanks to the likelihood that Trump will carry Montana by double digits, the dwindling number of split-ticket voters and by running in a state that has seen a surge of new residents, which political observers here believe benefits the GOP. Having an \u201cR\u201d next to his name could be enough to unseat Tester and flip the Senate \u2013 absent any major missteps.\u201cWhat Tim\u2019s been doing here is working,\u201d said Sen. Steve Daines, also a Montana Republican and the leader of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cWhy change strategies here with a month left? And just keep your head down and keep working hard on the grassroots.\u201dAs Daines described Sheehy\u2019s \u201ctremendous crowds\u201d at his events, saying he\u2019s running a \u201cgrassroots campaign unlike any I\u2019ve ever seen of a politician,\u201d the GOP senator added: \u201cI wish you could have seen him in action.\u201dSheehy, who owns an aerial firefighting company and who came to the state 10 years ago, is a former Navy SEAL and was recruited by Daines, who successfully urged Trump to endorse the wealthy political newcomer and help clear the field in the primary. And through his campaign ads, Sheehy is hammering Tester over his ties to national Democrats, like Kamala Harris, and over issues like the US-Mexico border.\u201cSo he\u2019s constructed this persona that he is this young conservative veteran, and doesn\u2019t really want to deviate from that or have anyone ask him any questions about, well, where do you stand on this issue? Where did you get your money? Where did you come from? Who are you exactly?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0said Mike Dennison, a long-time Montana political journalist, said of Sheehy\u2019s strategy.\u201cHe\u2019s pretty much shielded himself from the media,\u201d Dennison added.Sheehy did participate in two debates with Tester, including this past week where the candidates sparred over abortion, immigration and character. Sheehy attacked Tester over his campaign donations from lobbyists, while Tester seized on some of Sheehy\u2019s past statements, including over Native Americans, and accused him of seeking to privatize entitlement programs.And as Tester defended his handling of immigration, he pointed to Sheehy\u2019s opposition to a bipartisan border security bill that Republicans killed in Congress earlier this year, saying that his GOP opponent was only listening to his \u201cparty bosses.\u201d It was Trump who urged Republicans to kill the bill, though Tester didn\u2019t mention the former president\u2019s name.Sen. Jon Tester speaks at a rally in Bozeman, Montana, on September 5, 2024.William Campbell/Getty Images/FileTester won\u2019t say if he\u2019ll vote for HarrisTester, 68, is the last remaining statewide Democrat, having won each of his three terms by narrow margins \u2013 but none with Trump at the top of the ticket.In the Trump era, split ticket voting has become a rarity, with just one state out of 69 races in 2016 and 2020 electing a Senate candidate from a different party than their presidential choice. And for Tester to win, he likely would have to run at least 15-20 points ahead of Harris, a daunting task in this polarized political environment.And it\u2019s one reason why Tester is eager to keep his distance from the top of his ticket.\u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t want this race to be nationalized any more than they want it to be nationalized,\u201d Tester told CNN this week in Missoula, Montana, when asked about his decision not to endorse Harris. \u201cI want to talk about Montana.\u00a0That\u2019s what this race is about.\u201dAsked if he would vote for Harris, Tester said: \u201cThat\u2019s between me and the ballot box.\u201dTester\u2019s seat is one of three Democratic seats in states that Trump easily carried in the past two presidential elections. The West Virginia seat,\u00a0which will be vacated by Sen. Joe Manchin who left the Democratic Party to register as an independent earlier this year, is almost certain to flip to the GOP, while Sen. Sherrod Brown is battling to hang onto the Ohio seat against GOP challenger Bernie Moreno. Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to hold their seats in seven other states, while their only pickup opportunities are still considered long shots in Florida and Texas.That means Democrats essentially would have to run the table to simply keep the Senate at 50-50, hoping a Harris victory would give them governing control of a split chamber. To do that, Tester would have to win.Through his ads, Tester is blasting Sheehy as out of step on issues like health care and abortion rights, the latter of which is on the ballot in Montana and could give the incumbent Democrat a boost. The two sides have already spent a staggering $139 million on air, with another $69 million to come, making it the most expensive race in the state\u2019s history.In the interview, Tester downplayed the impact of Trump at the top of the GOP ticket, noting that the then-president stumped repeatedly in 2018 for Tester\u2019s then-opponent, Matt Rosendale, who ended up losing the race.\u201cWhen I ran in 2018, he came to the state four or five times \u2014 more times than I got fingers on my left hand,\u201d Tester said, referring to the three fingers he lost in a meat grinder accident at his family\u2019s butcher\u2019s shop when he was a kid. \u201cAnd it\u2019s part of the turf, it\u2019s part of what we do.\u201dBut at this week\u2019s debate, Sheehy pointed out some of Tester\u2019s past criticism of Trump, including saying in 2019: \u201cI think you need to go back and punch him in the face.\u201dAsked about those remarks this week, Tester said:\u00a0\u201cThat was totally figurative in speaking, and what, what I was referring the fact is, he\u2019s tough on us, you got to be tough on him.\u201dBut Tester is also standing by his votes to convict Trump at his two impeachment trials \u2013 another issue that Sheehy is spotlighting.Asked if he regretted those two votes, Tester told CNN: \u201cNot at all. No. I mean, the case was laid out, and I was part of the jury, you make the call.\u201dIn Missoula earlier this week, Sheehy argued how a Democratic-led Senate could be problematic for Trump, speaking at an event with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, another event that his campaign didn\u2019t disclose.\u201cIf Trump wins and he doesn\u2019t control the Senate, you can assume that he\u2019ll be impeached on day one,\u201d Sheehy said at the Monday event. \u201cAnd if he wins and does have the Senate, he can get things done like appoint Supreme Court justices.\u201dSheehy then left out the back without taking questions from the press.CNN\u2019s Morgan Rimmer and David Wright contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Trump spread conspiracies on mail-in voting for years.

According to the state\u2019s board of elections, there are 481,000 registered Republicans in the 25 counties, compared with 293,000 Democrats.Trump campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement that the proposals to expand voting access in North Carolina \u201cwill ensure the people who have already suffered from the storm don\u2019t lose their right to participate in this important election.\u201d\u201cSwift action from the North Carolina General Assembly and the Governor will ensure the people of their state have their voices heard on November 5th,\u201d they said.\u2018Too big to rig\u2019Trump has previouslyreleased videosand messageson his social mediapromoting early and mail-in voting as part of the Republican National Committee\u2019s get-out-the-vote program. Both methods of voting are promoted at Trump\u2019s campaign rallies.But that push has at times led to conflicting messaging from the former president.Last month, at a rally inIndiana, Pennsylvania, Trump disparaged early voting, and promoted it, in the same breath.\u201cWe got to get out and vote. And you can start right away. You know that, right? Now we have this stupid stuff where you can vote 45 days early. I wonder what the hell happens during that 45. \u2018Let\u2019s move, see these votes? We\u2019ve got about a million votes in there. Let\u2019s move them. We\u2019re fixing the air conditioner in the room, right?\u2019 No, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat happened the last time was disgraceful, including right here.

Roy Cooper on Thursday, gave the 25 counties in the federally declared disaster area additional flexibility to run their elections. The law contains provisions similar to several of Trump\u2019s proposals, including giving counties more flexibility on early voting hours and allowing counties to use temporary voting locations if precincts are unusable.Destroyed homes are seen in Chimney Rock, North Carolina, on October 2, 2024, after the passage of Hurricane Helene.Allison Joyce/AFP/Getty Images\u201cI will give the Republicans who are in charge here credit for passing good legislation (Wednesday) that definitely will address needs of voters,\u201d said Bob Phillips, the executive director of Common Cause North Carolina, a group that advocates for expanded voter access. \u201cThe biggest thing is giving each of these county board of elections the flexibility with regards to voting sites, both for early voting and Election Day.\u201dThe Trump campaign also proposed expanding bipartisan teams to help voters request and deliver absentee ballots to county boards and allowing voters displaced to other counties in the state to cast provisional ballots that would be delivered back to their home county.In Georgia, however,where Helene also caused significant damage,\u00a0Republicans\u00a0opposed an attempt to\u00a0expand voter access. The Republican National Committee intervened as a defendant in a lawsuit brought by civil rights groups to extend the county\u2019s voter registration deadline, which was Monday.A federal judge on Thursdaydenied that motion, saying it \u201clacked clarity and detail\u201d as to how specific individuals were harmed.A similar lawsuit over the voter registration deadline in Florida \u2013 which is still determining the damage inflicted byHurricane Milton\u2013 was also dismissed by a federal judge on Wednesday.An RNC spokesperson said liberal groups in Georgia were trying to use the courts to extend registration deadlines enacted by the legislature, when voters have had months to register to vote in Georgia.\u201cAs many Americans are still reeling from the impact of Hurricane Helene, the Trump Campaign and RNC are fighting to expand voting access for those displaced, and we are meeting voters where they are to ensure they are educated on voting changes,\u201d said RNC spokesperson Anna Kelly.Trump and his allies have argued there\u2019s a difference in changes approved by a legislature \u2013 like the campaign asked North Carolina to do \u2013 and many of the changes that were made in 2020 by election boards during the pandemic.Voting rights advocates say while the circumstances are different between a pandemic and a hurricane, the idea of allowing displaced voters to participate in an election should be the same.\u201cEven to the extent these disasters cause different hurdles, the policy solutions are often the same,\u201d said Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center. \u201cExpanded access is key, and in order to expand access, funding is key. The things we\u2019re advocating for right now in North Carolina and Florida, in many ways, echo the things we were advocating for in 2020.\u201d"}, {"title": "Postmaster general says ballots should be mailed in at least a week before Election Day", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/post-office-mail-in-voting-dejoy/index.html", "content": "CNN\u2014Postmaster General Louis DeJoy pledged Thursday that the US Postal Service will undertake \u201cheroic efforts\u201d to deliver all mail-in ballots on time this year and urged people to put their ballots in the mail at least one week before Election Day on November 5.\u201cLet me be clear, the Postal Service is ready to deliver the nation\u2019s mail-in ballots,\u201d DeJoy said at a news conference, held as a bipartisan group of election officials recently raised concerns about the delivery of mail ballots and former President Donald Trump repeats some of his debunked false claims about supposed fraud with mail-in voting.\u201cWe encourage the voting public to mail early if they chose to vote by mail,\u201d he said.USPS will work \u201caround the clock\u201d and implement \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to ensure the timely delivery of mail-in voting, DeJoy said. Arecord43% of voters cast mail ballots in 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic. The level isn\u2019t expected to be as high this year, but many states across the country haveexpandedthe availability of mail-in voting.These special measures include designated lines at post offices for people with ballots, extra deliveries and collections by letter-carriers, \u201cafter-hours\u201d drop-offs to election offices, and keeping processing facilities open on the Sunday before Election Day.The postmaster general tiptoed around a question from CNN about Trump\u2019s recent social media post, implicitly rebuking the former president without mentioning his name.\u201cMy response is like my response to everyone who says we\u2019re not prepared for the election \u2013 it is that they\u2019re wrong,\u201d DeJoy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I need to comment any more than that. They\u2019re wrong.\u201d\u201cFor a variety of reasons, there is a heightened sensitivity and scrutiny across the entire vote-by-mail ecosystem,\u201d DeJoy also said. \u201c\u2026The American public will become increasingly alarmed if there is ongoing dialogue that continues to question the reliability of the Postal Service for the upcoming elections.\u201dLyingaboutmail-in votingwas acenterpieceof Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, and as the 2024 race reaches the final stretch, he hasresurrectedmany of thesefalse claims.In a social media post on Sunday, Trump claimed without evidence that USPS \u201cadmitted that it is a poorly run mess.\u201d And Trump claimed in a recent interview with a right-wing radio host that USPS will \u201close hundreds of thousands of ballots, maybe purposely.\u201dDespite Trump\u2019s claims, voter fraud is extremely rare in US elections, according to studies from liberal and conservative groups, and the expansion of mail-in voting doesn\u2019t automatically benefit Democrats over Republicans.

That the effort has crossed party lines is rare enough in these polarized times.But that it happened in a community that backs a presidential candidate who has attacked the very law that is central to its rapid expansion underscores the complex \u2013 and in this case, contradictory - overlap of politics and a local economy.The Qcells solar panel plant in Dalton, GeorgiaCNNTrump strikes a chordLocated in the congressional district represented by GOP firebrandMarjorie Taylor Greene, Dalton is Trump country.\u201cThe independence that we keep up here \u2013 it\u2019s that independence and outsider that he\u2019s really struck a chord with,\u201d Carpenter said of Trump\u2019s rock-solid support in the area. \u201cAnd my folks, they appreciate that.

Kasey CarpenterCNNThis is the paradox playing out during a dramatic comeback for this part of the state.The Qcells plant \u2013 the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere \u2013 sits in what has long been known as the carpet capital of the world.The moniker can be found on the signs welcoming visitors to Dalton, which has held a dominant market share of the carpet and flooring industry for decades.But it also left the area particular vulnerable to something most thought was impossible until 2008: a housing market crash.\u201cIt was a bloodbath for us here,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cIt was a ghost town. And it took us years to get out of it.\u201dThe market collapse sparked local leaders to start thinking through \u2013 and setting up the infrastructure for \u2013 the diversification of the town\u2019s economy.That overlapped with efforts at the state level \u2013 most recently by Republican Gov.

His son and his daughter work here. There are high school students that we interview because of their gaming.\u201dWhat was once aspirational is now reality \u2013 and growing.\u2018A hometown feel\u2019Just about 50 miles down I-75 is Cartersville, where on a recent Saturday the center of town was jam-packed with residents stopping through booths filled by local vendors selling locally sourced food and agricultural goods.For two years running, this has been ranked the top farmer\u2019s market in Georgia, which might not be expected in a county that voted 75% for Trump in 2020.Cartersville, Georgia, Mayor Matt Santini talks with CNN's Phil Mattingly at the town's farmer's market.CNNBut in some ways, it\u2019s a key element to an approach that helped the town lure Qcells to build its next plant here, just a few miles away from where CNN linked up with its mayor, Matt Santini.This is clearly a Republican town, with deep-rooted support for the former president. But in Santini\u2019s mind, the true nature of the place is the community itself.\u201cIt\u2019s doubled in size since I moved here in the early \u201890s, but it\u2019s still a place where, again, you can walk through a farmer\u2019s market,\u201d Santini said. \u201cYou see people talking and getting along with each other. We have a hometown feel.\u201dCNNvideoRelated videoPoll shows Trump has edge with voters on this key issueBack in Dalton, that hometown feel is exactly the vibe a visitor gets walking into the Oakwood Cafe.The restaurant is technically the day job for Carpenter, the state legislator \u2013 and one that keeps him connected to the community he represents while in Atlanta when the Legislature is in session.\u201cI\u2019m real connected,\u201d Carpenter said with a chuckle. \u201cI fry their chicken on Monday, and Saturdays I\u2019m washing their dishes.\u201dCarpenter describes his community and its residents with pride.\u201cIt\u2019s blue-collar, man.

And it\u2019s real,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cIt will have consequences.\u201dQcells representatives are quick to point out that they first broke ground in Dalton in 2018 because Trump\u2019s tariffs on solar panels incentivized production stateside.Still, the former president\u2019s threats are impossible to ignore, even if the bipartisan support for the project across the federal, state and local levels offers it a level of protection should Trump win.\u201cYou want to ask me that after November?\u201d Nash, the Qcells plant manager, responded when asked about the future for the industry.Lisa Nash, the Qcells plant manager, speaks with Mattingly.CNNBut she underscored the scale of the transformation already underway \u2013 and what that means for the future.\u201cNo, I\u2019m optimistic because we\u2019re just scratching the surface,\u201d she said.It\u2019s a future Nash\u2019s parents thought didn\u2019t exist.\u201cBoth of them said, \u2018Don\u2019t go into manufacturing,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI\u2019d like to think they\u2019re both proud of me today because of this.

Just full shops. Amazing,\u201d Kerner recounted, inviting the obvious follow-up.So what happened to that street in Erie?\u201cIt\u2019s pretty decimated now,\u201d says the tool and die maker.Two of the most important battleground counties in two of the mostimportant battleground states.President Barack Obama won both handily on his path to reelection in 2012.Donald Trumpnarrowly captured each on his way to collapsing the Democrats\u2019 vaunted \u201cblue wall\u201d in 2016.Joe Bidengrabbed them back four years later \u2013 by the narrowest of margins.The closely watched political bellwethers share a familiar economic backdrop, animated by their collapse as great hubs in American manufacturing when globalization sucked the life out of industrial powerhouses in this part of the country.It\u2019s the throughline between the story as told by two families \u2013 the Colemans and the Kerners \u2013 with generational ties to these communities now fully ensconced in the political Klieg lights.They share a common passion for where they grew up and continue to reside today.

The automotive industry was the dominant employer \u2013 and between General Motors and the rings of suppliers and support businesses that surrounded the plant here, the community was deeply attached to the company\u2019s operations.\u201cEighty to ninety percent of the adults in the church were employed full time with GM,\u201d Coleman\u2019s father, a bishop in the Church of God in Christ, says of the congregation he inherited from his own dad.\u201cRight now, in our congregation, I have one person full-time employed by the auto industry,\u201d Hurley Coleman Jr. says.In recent years, other industries have started to move in to provide opportunities that had seemed all too fleeting as the broad-based manufacturing tied to major automakers atrophied in the area.Advanced manufacturing across several industries, including major investments in electric vehicle supply chains, have developed, and major hospitals and medical device companies have expanded their foothold.\u201cThe story that I\u2019d like for us to tell is that we\u2019re resilient and that we do bounce back and that we do have people in this region that are thinking towards the future and that we have, hopefully, a new generation of people that will love this region as well, just like we do,\u201d the younger Coleman says.Coleman was sitting at his kitchen table as he toggled between sparks of optimism \u2013 for his community and his family \u2013 and the weight of what he\u2019s experienced over the past several years.The nonprofit that he leads works with the residents who have the least.\u201cSometimes when they come in there and we are their last hope,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cThe lights are shut off. They have no food in the cabinets. Senior citizens have been sitting at home, nobody to call, nobody to help them out.\u201dThe best days are the smiles Coleman sees when his team provides that lifeline. But the weight of being a last resort in a community grappling with violence and poverty can be overwhelming.\u201cThere are those days when we have so many people that need help. So many problems, so many issues, so many emergencies and calamities that have happened,\u201d Coleman says.Phil KernerCNNA craftsman and a diminishing tradeBack in Erie, as Phil Kerner flips through the binder on his desk filled with sketches, time cards and family history, it\u2019s apparent there isn\u2019t much he hasn\u2019t saved over the years.There\u2019s the copy of the 1920 census that lists his grandfather Edward as a toolmaker in this corner of northwestern Pennsylvania.The story of Edward\u2019s three sons \u2013 two toolmakers and a machinist \u2013 shows how deeply intertwined his family had been with the trade and their community at one time.That\u2019s no longer the case.\u201cMy grandfather did this. My father did this. My uncles did it. My brothers did it. I did it. My kids aren\u2019t doing it,\u201d Kerner says. \u201cThat tells you everything, right?\u201dKerner still loves his tool and die craft and now works for a local family-owned manufacturer of component parts when he\u2019s not in the workshop he built in his basement.His work can be painstakingly intricate, from the granular details necessary in the sketch of a design to the art and science required to build a plastic injection mold.Toys, storage containers, mechanical parts and other items found in homes across the country are likely to contain the type of thing Kerner specializes in crafting.When President George W. Bush famously stood with a bullhorn on the still-smoldering rubble of ground zero after 9/11, the firefighter standing next to him had a respirator mask around his neck. Kerner designed and built the plastic mold for the mask.But Kerner can pinpoint the exact moment he saw his industry take a turn as part of a decadelong shift to cheaper and faster production overseas.\u201cI realized that my best customer for ten years was - I wouldn\u2019t use the word undermining me - but had totally abandoned a lot of us in Erie that were doing work for them,\u201d Kerner recalled.Kerner remains deeply passionate about his profession, so much so that as he saw interest waning in what he viewed as a top-tier trade, he took matters into his own hands.He launched a YouTube channel titled, naturally, \u201cThe Tool and Die Guy.\u201d He has more than 25,000 subscribers.\u201cI\u2019m just what they\u2019re looking for - irreverent enough, you know?\u201d Kerner said with a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m the toolmaker they always wish they had working next to them.\u201dThe videos \u2013 now more than 170, including one recapping his sitdown with CNN \u2013 was the furthest thing from a vanity project in search of social media fame.Instead, it was an effort born of that passion for his trade \u2013 and his deep concern that the appreciation for the skill and craftsmanship that goes with it has diminished in the same way that manufacturing has in places like Erie across the country.The impact, he notes, cuts far deeper than a plant and its employees. The entire community takes the hit.\u201cIt\u2019s sad to see it as somebody who has experienced the zenith of manufacturing from the 50s up until the 90s,\u201d Kerner says.A street in Erie, PensylvaniaCNN\u2018Probably going to call Trump\u2019Kerner cops to being \u201ca little bit of a political junkie,\u201d and he pays close attention to the broader economic news in the country.\u201cI always tell people I\u2019m not a Republican, I\u2019m a realist. I think they\u2019re all terrible,\u201d he says.He knows the broader macroeconomic numbers point to an economy that has exceeded expectations and forecasts for several years running. But his view of the economy is tied to what he\u2019s seeing in his household.\u201cIt\u2019s not like my wages are going up,\u201d Kerner says. \u201cNot a complaint, but my wages aren\u2019t going up. And I get it - I see that touted a lot. Wages going up. Wages going up. I talk to my friends, \u2018Your wages going up?\u2019 No. I don\u2019t know whose wages are going up.\u201dHe describes his decision for who to vote for in similar terms \u2013 comparing it to a business owner forced to choose between making payroll or paying suppliers.\u201cIf you don\u2019t figure this out, you lose your home. We\u2019re going to foreclose on you. Who are you going to call?\u201d Kerner asks. \u201cProbably going to call Trump.\u201dHe estimates about 95% of the people he works with also support Trump.\u201cI think the general consensus in the business community is Trump\u2019s kind of one of us or one of them, you know, because he\u2019s at least on it,\u201d Kerner says. \u201cYou ain\u2019t like the way he did it, but that\u2019s his background.\u201dWhat he\u2019d really like to see, he makes clear repeatedly, is something that flies far beneath the current political radar. Elevated and uniform apprenticeship standards that take into account the importance of the trade \u2013 and the value that comes with it, which should ensure lifelong employment in manufacturing.It is, in many ways, the point of his YouTube videos, which have taken on a deeper meaning for him over time.\u201cAs long as there\u2019s an internet, people will know that there was a Kerner family in Erie, Pennsylvania.

He hears often about the border and whether migrants are taking federal aid that could help people in his community.The pandemic-era stimulus checks, which Trump made a point of putting his name on, also come up regularly.\u201cThere are people who think that the stimulus checks that came out during the pandemic and things of that nature are something that\u2019s going to happen again,\u201d Coleman\u2019s father says.Still, Biden\u2019s decision to drop out of the race and Harris\u2019 rise has sparked a new level of enthusiasm, according to the elder Coleman.\u201cNow the conversation is not how bad Biden was or how good Trump was, but what possibly could happen with a Harris presidency,\u201d the bishop says. \u201cI think there\u2019s more opportunistic hope that\u2019s been created in the last few weeks.\u201dDriving down Williams Street with the younger Coleman, just before the Saginaw River, it\u2019s impossible to miss the string of abandoned silos that jut into the skyline.Once an unavoidable blot hanging over the city\u2019s business and arts districts, they were transformed a few years ago into a 70,000-square-foot canvas for contract street artists.For Coleman, the eruption of bright colors and unwieldy shapes represents more than just a beautification project.\u201cWhat was old, what was outdated is about its experience of having transformation and rebirth,\u201d he says, staring at the mural. \u201cAnd people are going to benefit off of others\u2019 creativity and desire to see change.

He would like to see his theory proved true that stepping back wasn\u2019t just about making money off ofpodcasting with Bruce Springsteenornarrating a documentary seriesabout parks for Netflix \u2014 as some resentful Democrats came to feel \u2014 but about letting new people emerge without his shadow.\u201cThe goal has always been to pass the torch to the next generation of leaders to ensure the party is sustainable long term without him,\u201d said Hannah Hankins, a spokesperson for the former president who first worked for him in the White House.All that and the survival of much of what he put in place as president depends on his main mission for the fall: breaking through to\u00a0 young Black men, as he is uniquely situated to do, hoping they don\u2019t give up on the Democratic Party in the high numbers that even internal Harris-aligned campaign polling show may be happening.Thatpoured out of Obamaon Thursday, when ahead of his first campaign rally in Pittsburgh, he turned what was supposed to be a perfunctory stop by a Harris office into a visceral calling out of young Black men for \u201ccoming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses\u201d for not supporting Harris, abandoning their communities and themselves.

A lot has been with Hakeem Jeffries, the New York congressman hoping to become the next speaker of the House whose connection to the former president runs so deep that, as he sometimes points out, he has the same birthday and his wife is also named Michelle.After their own one-on-one meeting, Obama asked Jeffries to suggest a few small groups of Democratic House members for trips to his office in the World Wildlife Federation in northwest Washington. The members ranged from New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to much lesser known and less progressive\u00a0up-and-comers, like Washington Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola. He talked to them about coming off like real people rather than scolding coastal elites and staying consistent rather than\u00a0being\u00a0pulled into the whirlwind of Washington consultant advice, according to people in the room.Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump looks on during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on October 5, 2024.Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleAs Trump delays transition process, Biden and Harris teams push forward with post-election planningSeveral took written notes, including a nervous congressman who watched Obama play with an aide\u2019s child before their meeting started and wrote down to focus on learning how to charm babies, according to one of the people who saw it.Obama\u2019s session last November with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the incumbent Democratic senators running in 2024 was more focused on briefing Obama on their races so he could better understand their challenges and offer support.\u201cIt was great to be able to begin the strategy with him,\u201d said Pennsylvania Sen.

Neither president was thrilled with how the last few years played out between them.Long before Biden\u2019s dismal debate in June, the president had been complaining privately that Obama wasn\u2019t helping enough, according to several people who spoke to Biden. Biden aides sensed a jealousy from Obama\u2019s orbit that they were racking up more accomplishments than he had, with senior adviser Mike Donilon saying once in private conversation, \u201cThey need to get over it,\u201d according to one of the people who heard it \u2014 and Biden aides hated the Republican conspiracy theory that Obama was actually pulling the strings.For over a year, when Biden wanted a former president sounding board, he was ringing up Bill Clinton instead.After Biden\u2019s debate debacle, diehards burned that Obama had left the president to twist in the wind when he could have more forcefully ended the questions, while many Democrats suffering through that month felt he was going feckless again. Many calls came in.Biden\u2019s dropping out sparked its own Obama drama, and not just because the president\u2019s immediate endorsement of Harris came with the added benefit of demonstrating a deference he often complained he never got from his old boss. While most of the party leaders Harris calledthat Sunday afternoon, including Bill Clinton, immediately pledged support, Obama held off. He offered advice and encouragement but told her he wanted to make sure the process was seen as legitimate in a way it might not have if he had jumped out early.Harris advisers knew Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi favored an open process to find a new nominee. What some couldn\u2019t figure out was how much of that was Obama\u2019s doubts and disappointments about Harris from her 2019 campaign and early vice presidency shining through, and how much was a political calculation that she would be better off if she emerged after a process rather than a coronation.Former President Bill Clinton speaks at the DNC on Wednesday, August 21, in Chicago.Rebecca Wright/CNNRelated articleBill Clinton to hit battleground states for HarrisSeveral people familiar with Obama\u2019s thinking said that he thought she was in the strongest position starting out, but he believed others would run \u2014 and that he was pleased to see her talking that week about earning the nomination even as others didn\u2019t. When the Obamas called Harris that Wednesday to officially endorse, his argument was that he was acting as the closer, certifying party unity, even as some outsiders complained it looked like he had held out as long as he could.Obama and Biden have spoken once since the president\u00a0dropped out. Obama initiated\u00a0the conversation, telling aides to let the White House know he was eager for a call whenever Biden had time, and they soon spoke. It wasn\u2019t the two presidents\u2019 deepest or longest conversation. Obama said he appreciated all that Biden had done as president, and how hard stepping aside was. He said he loved him like a brother\u00a0and\u00a0always would. Biden took the call to heart, without hard feelings. He thanked Obama for reaching out.Obama has had several conversations with Harris, whom he first got to know through an informal network of up-and-coming Black politicians when he was a state senator and she was a district attorney. One centered entirely on her running mate selection, though he was giving his take on how she should approach the process rather than weighing in for one candidate. Others have been to help guide her through everything from staffing decisions to bigger picture strategy. And according to people who know about the conversations, he checks in with several of his own closest aides now helping run Harris\u2019 campaign, such as current campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon and his own 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe.In both public and in private conversations, Obama has heaped praise on Harris for the way she\u2019s campaigned and what she\u2019s campaigning on.Meanwhile, conversations are underway to get Michelle Obama to carry through withher own \u201cdo something\u201d speechfrom August\u2019s Democratic National Convention.

I really do,\u201d the former president said on \u201cThe John Kobylt Show,\u201d a Southern California talk radio show, while complaining about the state\u2019s mail-in voting procedures.But Trump\u2019s allies argue the blue-state stops are more than undisciplined sideshows designed to satisfy the Republican nominee\u2019s whims.Though Democrats dominate California and New York, the states\u2019 overall size means they\u2019re home to huge numbers of Republican voters and donors, creating fundraising opportunities and helping down-ballot candidates, particularly in competitive House races.\u201cWe have a lot of support in California, and I felt I owed it to them,\u201d Trump told Kobylt, adding that the Coachella Valley rally venue is \u201ca great piece of land.\u201dThe events also give Trump opportunities to cast the problems facing the states he\u2019s in as the result of Democratic leadership.That\u2019s the playbook Trump used Thursday in Detroit,when he warned that if Harris wins, \u201cour whole country will end up being like Detroit.\u201dBut unlike Michigan\u2019s largest city, Trump can make similar comments in blue states without worrying about electoral blowback \u2013 particularly in California, where Harris was attorney general and a US senator.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s trip to Coachella will highlight Harris\u2019 failing record and show that he has the right solutions to save every state and every American,\u201d Trump\u2019s communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement.Trump\u2019s campaign also expects to draw huge, raucous crowds, and command outsized media attention \u2013 which would pay dividends across the political map.\u201cThe location of his rallies matters less in this nationalized media environment. His messaging is making it to all the major media markets regardless of what he does. And the bigger the rally, the more attention it will get, right? I mean, Madison Square Garden? You guys have to cover it,\u201d a senior Trump adviser told CNN.Trump advisers argue that the voters his campaign is targeting in the race\u2019s closing weeks are those who do not typically engage in politics \u2013 and so trips like the one he made to Aurora, Colorado, on Friday to hammer Harris on immigration provide content that has much more reach online than a typical swing-state campaign rally.It\u2019s the same reason Trump\u2019s campaign has had the former president sit down with popular YouTube streamers and podcasters. Harris\u2019 campaign has employed a similar strategy in recent weeks, targeting specific groups of voters with her appearances on podcasts and other interviews.\u201cThere\u2019s reason why we\u2019re doing podcasts. There is a reason why we\u2019re doing Adin Ross and MMA. There\u2019s a reason why we\u2019re doing those things,\u201d one senior Trump adviser said.Coachella rallyTrump\u2019s rally Saturday at the Calhoun Ranch in the Coachella Valley drew criticism from a number of local officials.\u201cTrump\u2019s attacks on immigrants, women, the LGBTQ community and the most vulnerable among us don\u2019t align with the values of our community,\u201d Coachella Mayor Steven Hernandez said in a statement posted on social media ahead of Trump\u2019s visit.\u201cHe has consistently expressed disdain for the type of diversity that helps define Coachella,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why Trump is visiting near Coachella, but we know he wasn\u2019t invited by the people who live here. He ain\u2019t like us.\u201dHowever, the former president believes large-scale rallies in blue states like the one he\u2019ll hold Saturday show how deep his support runs across the nation.They also set the groundwork for Trump to question the election results should Harris win. One of the former president\u2019s go-to lines is \u201ctoo big to rig\u201d \u2014 the idea that he must win in such a landslide that no one will question his victory.\u201cHe thinks those crowds show, and will show, there\u2019s no way she can win,\u201d a person close to Trump said.Trump in many ways views these large-scale rallies as a barometer for how he is performing. In his mind, the bigger the crowd, the better he expects to do in November.Chicago, New York plansOn Tuesday, Trump will make another blue state stop in Illinois, attending an event cosponsored by Bloomberg News and the Economic Club of Chicago.Trump is also planning a return to New York \u2013 where he has held rallies in the Bronx and Long Island in recent weeks, part of his effort to appeal to non-White men who have historically supported Democrats.The September stop on Long Island had initially been scheduled to coincide with Trump\u2019s sentencing in his New York hush money trial in Manhattan, before the judge overseeing the case ultimately pushed the date back to after the election.Madison Square Garden on October 27, meanwhile, will give Trump a legendary theater in his hometown, a little more than a week from Election Day.Trump has long teased a Madison Square Garden rally. But sources close to the former president were hesitant to announce the rally, even after the deal had been done, noting the external pressure that could be put on the venue, particularly by powerful New Yorkers, to pull out.While Trump lost the Empire State by more than 20 points in both 2016 and 2020, he insisted in September at his Long Island rally he has a chance of winning the state in November.\u201cTrump has increasingly been fixated on this idea that his supporters in states not viewed as crucial to the 2024 election deserve to have an opportunity to see him and attend a rally,\u201d a person close to Trump said. \u201cIn some cases, those events can be an even bigger draw since it\u2019s the only chance a lot of people have to go to a rally.\u201d\u2018A complete waste of his time\u2019Trump is projecting confidence in how he\u2019ll perform in the blue states he\u2019s visiting. He claimed Friday in Aurora that he is \u201cvery close\u201d in the reliably Democratic state \u2014 though there\u2019s no evidence to support that.Still, the main strategic purpose of those trips is to hit Democrats on issues Trump\u2019s campaign sees as its strongest, including crime and border security.Trump, who has been promoting false and sensationalized claims about Venezuelan gang members taking over Colorado, attacked the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Jared Polis, on Friday.\u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t see what you see. He doesn\u2019t see people bursting into buildings with AK-47s, military style weapons, sometimes better than our own military,\u201d he said.Trump said he would create a federal program to expedite the deportation of undocumented gang members if he wins in November. He also called for the death penalty for \u201cany migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer.\u201dColorado Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that Trump was lying about migrant crime in Colorado \u2013 but that from a political perspective, he was somewhat \u201chappy\u201d to see the former president in the state.\u201cThere\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to win the state of Colorado,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cAnd so, from a political point of view, I think this was a complete waste of his time.\u201d"}, {"title": "Trump campaign asks for military aircraft with antimissile capabilities and other security measures in lead-up to election", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/11/politics/donald-trump-security-requests/index.html", "content": "WashingtonCNN\u2014After two attempted assassinations and an ongoingthreat from Iran, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign hasramped up requests for security,including transport by military aircraft and additional security measures on the ground at the former president\u2019s campaign stops, three sources familiar with the discussions told CNN.Trump\u2019s campaign wants to use these resources \u2013 including access to military aircraft with deterrent systems to protect against surface-to-air missiles \u2013 as the former president crisscrosses the US during the final weeks of the presidential campaign.President Joe Biden, when asked about Trump\u2019s requests on Friday, said they should be fulfilled \u2013 \u201cas\u00a0long as he doesn\u2019t ask for F-15s.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve told the department to give him every single thing he needs \u2026 as he were a sitting president,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf it fits into that category, that\u2019s fine.\u201dSusie Wiles, co-campaign manager for Trump, initially made the request for enhanced measures during a call about two weeks ago with Biden\u2019s chief of staff, Jeff Zients, two sources familiar with the conversation told CNN. Wiles then made the formal request for additional security with acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe on September 30, according to an email reviewed by CNN.A third source familiar with Wiles\u2019 call with Zients said Biden\u2019s chief of staff immediately connected Wiles to leadership at the Department of Homeland Security and Secret Service \u201cso she had a direct line.\u201d The source said Zients made clear that the president had directed the Secret Service to provide the highest level of protection for Trump.The requests from Trump\u2019s campaign also include access to Camp David vehicles for Trump\u2019s primary motorcade as well as access to other military assets, such as drones with thermal monitoring.In addition, Trump\u2019s campaign asked the US Secret Service to increase stockpiles of ballistic glass across several key swing states that the agency now uses to encase Trump at his outdoor rallies.And the campaign asked for more funding for local law enforcement officials who augment the president\u2019s security detail and for additional administrative support from Secret Service headquarters.The Secret Service is now working on formal requests for these resources that will first go to the Department of Homeland Security and then to the Department of Defense as well as any other agencies that would need to be involved, according to a federal law enforcement official.Two sources close to the campaign said Trump officials are frustrated that the extra protections have not been implemented given the heightened security threats facing the former president, and the campaign has begun implementing some new security measures.According to one of the sources, Trump has started changing up his routine, taking different planes to events around the country and staying at different\u00a0properties than he usually would as the 2024 presidential election nears.The source said Trump\u2019s security team implemented the changes because it had lost faith in the Secret Service following the two attempts on the former president\u2019s life as well as the denial of certain resources in the past.\u00a0Trump\u2019s team maintains that its concerns are with those at theSecret Service headquarters, not with Trump\u2019s personal detail, many of whomhave been with the former president since he left office.But Trump\u2019s team has also been informed that some of the requests aren\u2019t feasible for any presidential candidate. Trump has complained privately that he is forced to hold smaller rallies because of the security concerns, though every president and presidential candidate has faced restrictions on their freedom of movement because of security concerns, according to two sources familiar with the matter.Security resources are also often determined on a case-by-case basis, one administration official said.The Secret Service maintains that \u201cthe former president is receiving the highest levels of protection,\u201d agency spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe Secret Service will remain vigilant and continue to adjust and enhance its protective posture as needed to mitigate evolving threats.\u201dGuglielmi said the agency isalready imposing flight restrictionsover Trump\u2019s residence and when he travels.\u00a0Guglielmi also said that the former president \u201cis receiving the highest level of technical security assets which include unmanned aerial vehicles, counter unmanned aerial surveillance systems, ballistics and other advanced technology systems.\u201dStill, the request for additional resources could hit roadblocks. Some of them may run into legal issues given constitutional limits on the military operating inside the United States, the federal law enforcement official said.The Secret Service has implemented a number of changes since Trump was nearly killed by a shooter in July and after another shooter allegedly set up what prosecutors called a \u201csniper\u2019s nest\u201d outside Trump\u2019s Florida golf course in September when the former president was playing just one hole away.\u00a0Separately,\u00a0US authorities have obtained intelligence\u00a0showing that there is an Iranian assassination threat against Trump.The Secret Service has increased its presence around Trump, adding members to his detail and taking extra precautions, often traveling with a counter assault team. Secret Service agents previously assigned to desk jobs or other posts also have also been brought into the rotation to protect Trump.After Trump\u2019s near-assassination in Pennsylvania in July, the campaign also requested that it be allowed to have an observer in command centers with local, state and federal authorities during campaign events, a source familiar with the ask told CNN.
