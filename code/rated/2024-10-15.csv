cnn,Follow the sprint to Election Day,https://www.cnn.com/politics/election-2024-key-dates-dg/index.html,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.CNN—The race to Election Day in November is in high gear.Voters are casting ballots either by mail or in early voting. The October 1vice presidential debatebetween Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrat, and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican, was likely the last meeting between the Democratic campaign led by Vice President Kamala Harris and the Republican campaign led by former President Donald Trump.While the scene is set for what pollsters expect could be an extremely close election,there will be unexpected developments between now and Election Day on November 5.Nobody expected President Joe Biden’scampaign to implodeafter theshock of his performance at CNN’s debate in late June. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Harris as his replacement.Nobody expected anassassination attempt against Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience.So we don’t know specifically what will happen between now andElection Day, or what could come after, when the country’s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect:Voting is well underwayCNNRelated articleYour personalized voter handbook for the presidential electionWhile Election Day isn’t until November 5, most states allow some kind of early voting, either by mail or in person, and that process kicks into overdrive in October.Most Americans, nearly 70%, voted early or by mail in 2020, according tocensus figures, although that figure was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.The campaigns will be focused on getting out the vote in the few key battleground states they think are up for grabs. In 2020, Biden won five states that Trump won in 2016. Those states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – could again be the focus in 2024 when Harris, who turns 60 in October, takes on Trump.It’s important to be sure you’re registered to vote as soon as possible, which can usually be done online. Twenty-three states and Washington, DC, allow Election Day voter registration.Election Day and beyondUS law requires federal elections to take place on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that’s November 5.People who don’t vote early will hit their local voting location. Polls will close at different times around the country. Due to the rise of voting by mail, if key states are close, like they were in 2020, we probably won’t know the winner on Election Day.Regardless, expect lawsuits in certain states and the potential for recounts in others. Election Day is far from the end of the election.Separately,Trump’s sentencingon 34 counts of falsifying business records is now scheduled for November 26.Also this month: Biden turns 82.December: Electoral votes are castAfter questions about the election are settled, states confirm, or ascertain, their statewide results. Electors gather in their respective state capitols to cast electoral votes for their statewide winner.Nebraska and Maine also allocate some electoral votes by congressional district, and these could be pivotal in a close race.January: Someone will solemnly swearThe new Congress takes the oath of office on January 3. It’s this new Congress that, in the unlikely event ofan Electoral College tie, would settle the election. Each state would get one vote for president in the House of Representatives.In any event, lawmakers gather on January 6, as everyone should remember from 2020, to count electoral votes. Harris will preside. She could either be thefifth vice president in historyto oversee her own Electoral College victory, or the fourth in history to oversee her own Electoral College defeat.On January 20, 2025, the next president takes the oath of office.This story has been updated with additional developments.","Score: 0

cnn,The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/politics/senate-race-rankings-october-2024/index.html,"CNN—With just over a month until Election Day, the same competitive races continue to dominate the Senate landscape, but there are a few significant changes to the order of CNN’s ranking of the seats most likely to flip.And in the final weeks, the degree to which these 10 races – which are mostly playing out in statesDonald Trumpeither won or narrowly lost in 2020 – move in the same direction as the presidential contest will likely determine which party wins control of the Senate.Republican Senate candidate for Montana Tim Sheehy walks up to the stage during a rally for Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump at the Brick Breeden Fieldhouse at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana, on August 9, 2024.Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images/FileRelated articleHow the Senate GOP’s potential majority maker is staying ‘shielded’ in push to oust Tester in MontanaRepublicans – who are virtually a lock to pick up the West Virginia seat and would need to either win the White House or pick up one more seat for the majority – have an incentive to nationalize many of their targeted races. Well-funded Democratic incumbents, for the most part, are touting statewide and local accomplishments and their support for abortion rights.Two states that are part of the Democratic “blue wall” – and also key White House battlegrounds – move up on this month’s rankings, which are based on reporting, as well as fundraising, polling and advertising data. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are now in the middle of the pack of flippable seats, along with Michigan, which remains at No. 4.The oddity of this year’s fight for the Senate is that Democrats have consistently led in the public polling of key races, but it’s Republicans who are poised to gain seats and, potentially, control of the chamber.That’s a reflection of the Senate map – but also increasingly some post-Labor Day tightening as GOP spending picks up and voters get to know their candidates. Still, no public general election polling that meets CNN standards has shown the Republican nominee ahead in any of the seats that Democrats are defending, save for West Virginia.And two GOP targets – Arizona and Nevada – are moving down the list because Republicans have not kept the races as competitive as elsewhere.Earlier this year, those two states were Nos. 4 and 5. Now, they’re at 7 and 8.Florida Sen. Rick Scott, left, and Texas Sen. Ted CruzGetty ImagesRelated articleSenate Democrats launch first multimillion-dollar TV investments in Texas and Florida as map grows more dauntingAt the same time, Democrats are trying to expand the map in hopes of mitigating potential losses. As CNNfirst reportedlast week, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is making multimillion-dollar TV investments in Texas and Florida. DSCC Chairman Gary Peters has insisted that this is extra spending that won’t take money away from their defensive priorities. Texas remains at No. 9 on CNN’s ranking, while Florida fell off the list earlier this year in favor of the race in deep-blue Maryland.Nebraska is a new state generating political buzz, but it hasn’t earned a place on the ranking. Still, independent Dan Osborn’s challenge to GOP Sen. Deb Fischer has prompted the National Republican Senatorial Committee to start spending here, and elections analysts have moved the race out of the solid Republican category.There remain lots of unknowns in Nebraska, but we’ll be watching to see how that race – and the 10 others – develop over the next month.1. West VirginiaSen. Joe ManchinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/FileWest Virginia is essentially out of reach for Democrats, who had little chance of holding this seat without Sen. Joe Manchin running for reelection. Manchin, now an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is likely to be succeeded by Republican Jim Justice, the state’s two-term governor.Justice has had his share of negative headlines, but in a state poised to back Trump by a significant margin, it’s hard to see a world in which Republicans don’t pick up this open seat.2. MontanaSen. Jon TesterAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileDemocrat Jon Tester, who’s running for a fourth term in a state Trump has twice carried by double digits, remains the most vulnerable Senate incumbent this year. Republicans feel confident their nominee,Tim Sheehy, has an edge – and both Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales and the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter have shifted their rating of the once toss-up race toward the GOP.Democrats still see a path to victory for Tester, who has a proven history of defying the partisan lean of his state by communicating both what he’s done for Montanans and painting a contrast with his opponents.Democrats are trying that playbook against Sheehy, trying to define the wealthy businessman and retired Navy SEAL, who moved to Montana in 2014, as an out-of-state carpetbagger who cannot be trusted. Recentlyunearthed audio recordingsof Sheehy using racist stereotypes to refer to Native Americans has played into that message, with Democrats arguing that he’s alienating a crucial demographic in the state. In a debate earlier this week, Sheehy acknowledged his comments were “insensitive,” saying, “I come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color sometimes.”Tester’s campaign is now leaning into abortion rights on the airwaves – an issue that’s on the ballot in Montana this year. Arecent adfeatures a self-described “life-long” Republican woman arguing that Sheehy “wants to take away personal freedoms.”But Republicans are invoking transgender issues in an attempt to cast Tester as a liberal who’s been changed by his years in Washington, while Sheehy istrying to tie Tester to KamalaHarris– especially on immigration. Tester – who has not endorsed in the presidential race – tried to meet those attacks during their debate by pointing out that Sheehy would not have supported this year’s bipartisan border bill that Republicans blocked.3. OhioSen. Sherrod BrownBonnie Cash/Getty Images/FileDemocratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing his toughest reelection in a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 points. Public polling still shows the three-term senator ahead of GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, although that is expected to tighten as more Republican voters come home to Moreno. Brown was at 47% to Moreno’s 43% in a late SeptemberNew York Times/Siena College pollamong likely Ohio voters – not far outside the margin of error. But the reassuring news for Democrats: Brown was winning 10% of Trump voters.Democrats have seized on Moreno’s recent comments at a town hall suggesting that some suburban women were single-issue voters when it comes to abortion and questioning why women over 50 would care about the topic. Brown pointed to the remarks as evidence that his opponent is out of step with the 57% of Ohio voters who last year approved a ballot measure protecting reproductive rights. WinSenate, a Democratic outside group, also launcheda new adwith a woman talking about the emergency abortion she underwent at 25 for an ectopic pregnancy, saying, “Our lives don’t belong in Bernie Moreno’s hands.”(Moreno’s campaign said in a statement that he was “clearly making a tongue-in-cheek joke about how Sherrod Brown and members of the leftwing media like to pretend that the only issue that matters to women voters is abortion,” and that Moreno believes women “care just as much about the economy, rising prices, crime and our open southern border as male voters do.”)The Senate contest in Ohio ranked as the most expensive congressional race on record, as of October 3, with total ad spending from both parties this cycle, including future reservations, exceeding $446 million, according to AdImpact. Brown – who announced raising $30.6 million in the third quarter – has continued totouthis work to pass the PACT Act to help veterans exposed to burn pits, while Morenotries to nationalizethe race by tying Brown to Harris and inflation and linking himself to Trump. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to GOP leadership, isattackingBrown over transgender issues to try to cast him as out-of-step with the partisanship of the state.4. MichiganSen. Debbie StabenowAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileMichigan remains the most competitive open seat on this list. Democrat Elissa Slotkin has held a narrow edge in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, but the absence of an incumbent and the competitiveness of the presidential race in the Wolverine State makes it one that could come down to the wire.Slotkin, a third-term congresswoman, led Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers 47% to 42% among likely voters in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll, with Slotkin drawing 6% of likely voters who also said they would vote for Trump. Slotkin has a strong fundraising record – her campaign announced raising $18 million in the third quarter – but Republicans are pouring more money into this state, with the Senate Leadership Fund recently announcing a $22.5 million investment.Slotkin has been runningads on abortion– an issue that has helped propel recent Democratic victories in the state. Herspotsclaim that Rogers’ past support for abortion restrictions makes him untrustworthy on the issue now. “I’m scared that Mike Rogers will continue to take away my rights,” says one woman in a spot who says she needed an abortion to save her life.Rogers has been responding on air, speaking directly to camera while holding hands with his wife inone new spot,saying he respects Michigan voters’ decision on abortion rights and “won’t do anything to change it” in the Senate.Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, scored the endorsement of the state Farm Bureau’s PAC, which had previously backed Stabenow (the chair of the Senate Agriculture panel). Rogers, whom Democrats have attacked for living in Florida after he left Congress a decade ago, is runningspotsthat tout his Michigan roots and public service. Rogers and Republicans are alsoattacking Slotkinandthe Biden administrationover plans to support the building of electric vehicles, using the misleading term “mandate.”5. PennsylvaniaSen. Bob CaseyAndrew Harnik/Getty ImagesDemocratic Sen. Bob Casey’s race against Republican challenger Dave McCormick moves two spots up on the list in light of heavy GOP outside spending, some tighter polling and the competitiveness of the presidential race in a state that is part of Democrats’ so-called blue wall of must-win states.September polling from Marist, Quinnipiac University, the New York Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer, Franklin & Marshall, CBS News/YouGov and Fox News all gave Casey anywhere from a 5- to 9-point lead among likely voters. Polls from CNN and The Washington Post around the same time, however, showed no clear leader.The two candidates, who met on the debate stage for the first time Thursday night, have been hitting the airwaves with competing messages, as have their allied outside groups. Democrats are going after McCormick onabortion,includingonead that features footage of him referring to himself as “pro-life.” The Senate Leadership Fund, which is adding $28 million to GOP sending here, and the pro-McCormickKeystone Renewal PAChave been attacking Casey over inflation andimmigration.McCormick’s tenure as the CEO of FreeMarkets – a Pittsburgh-based software company – has also been featured in ads on both sides.The Democratic group WinSenateis accusing him ofoutsourcing jobsand pointing to his management of the company to argue that “Connecticut Dave”  – he owns a home in the Nutmeg State – “wants to buy our Senate seat.” McCormick is running ads featuringformer FreeMarkets employeespraising him and touting the company’s hiring policies.6. WisconsinSen. Tammy BaldwinMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesWisconsin also moves up two spots on the list amid signs that some Republicans could be drifting home toward their party’s nominee, Eric Hovde, in his challenge to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.The two-term senator maintained a modest edge over Hovde in aMarquette University Law School pollreleased this week – 51% to 45% among likely voters when third-party candidates are included and 53% to 46% in a head-to-head matchup. Baldwin had a similar 7-point lead in aNew York Times/Siena College surveyof the two-person race taken around the same time.While Baldwin has repeatedly outraised Hovde, the Senate Leadership Fund is also pouring funds – $17 million – into the Badger State, and Hovde has plenty of his own money to pay for ads at the lower candidate rate if he chooses. (We’ll be eying his third-quarter fundraising filing for details about how much the Sunwest Bank CEO had loaned his campaign through September.) Ads from Hovde – whose campaign recently underwent a shakeup – havesought to tie Baldwinto Harris, attacking her over border security, fentanyl andtransgender rights.But Baldwin, who’s made an effort tovisit the red, rural parts of Wisconsin, has a well-defined brand. She picked up theendorsementof the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation this week – a notable get for a Democrat running statewide. Much of Democratic advertising has played up Hovde’s past controversial comments and sought to cast him as a California carpetbagger – he owns property in Laguna Beach, even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin and his family’s company is a prominent state brand.7. ArizonaSen. Kyrsten SinemaAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileArizona is a conservative-leaning purple state, where Republicans should ordinarily be able to pick off a Senate seat – especially an open one. But in the race to replace retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, Republican candidate Kari Lake seems to have hit a ceiling.The 2022 gubernatorial nominee is well known in the state, but not necessarily for the right reasons. She still refuses to accept her loss for governor and, despite tethering herself to Trump, is underperforming his polling numbers.Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego led Lake by 10 points among likely voters in aMarist polland 13 points in aFox News survey, both from mid-September. Lake was polling behind Trump in both surveys by 6 points and 8 points respectively.Lake and the NRSC areblaming Gallegofor inflation and immigration – pointing to his support for what they’re calling the “Kamala Inflation Act.” (Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.) And while the Senate Leadership Fund hasn’t spent here, a Club for Growth-affiliated group is also airingattackson the congressman. Gallego, a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was on the airwaves for months introducing himself to voters statewide as a Marine veteran and istouting his supportfrom law enforcement andRepublican voters. He announced raising $21.7 million in the third quarter.8. NevadaSen. Jacky RosenAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileNevada moves down two spots on the list as Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen appears to be in a stronger position against Republican opponent Sam Brown in a state where Democratic prospects seem to have picked up since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.Rosen, who appeared at a Harris rally in Las Vegas earlier this week, led Brown by 10 points in aCNN pollin late August. Like Lake in Arizona, Brown – an Army veteran who first ran for office in Texas and lost the GOP primary for Nevada’s other Senate seat last year – also appears to be running up against a ceiling.Rosen and Democrats are hitting Brownover his previous stances on abortion– which is on the ballot this year in Nevada. Brown, who says he supports current state law legalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks, has said he’d “close the door” on backing a national abortion ban.Rosen has had a fundraising edge over her opponent, and this week, national Republicans canceled their remaining independent expenditures in the state in favor of running hybrid ads with Brown, which allows them to benefit from the lower candidate rate in the ultra-pricey Las Vegas media market — a strategy they’ve employed in races across the country to try to compete with well-funded Democratic candidates on the airwaves.9. TexasSen. Ted CruzTierney L. Cross/Getty Images/FileNational Democrats’ decision toinvest TV resourcesin Texas was the first major signal the party is putting money where its mouth is on the competitiveness of the Lone Star State this year. Democrats see Republican Sen. Ted Cruz as unpopular and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred, as the man to beat him, even in a state that is still comfortably red at the presidential level.The first hybridadbetween Allred and the DSCC features Kate Cox, the woman who had to leave the state to seek an abortion after her fetus had been diagnosed with a deadly condition, and Amanda Zurawski, who sued the state after she was denied an abortion when experiencing complications. “If you’re experiencing pregnancy complications in Texas, you’re in danger,” Zurawski says in the ad, “and it’s Ted Cruz and the anti-abortion extremists’ fault.”Allred has also tried to flip the script on Republicans byaccusing Cruzof “doing nothing to secure the border.” Cruz, in turn, isattacking Allredover a vote related to the inclusion of transgender athletes in women’s sports. “Boys and girls are different,” is how anotheradfrom the Republican opens. “This election is about keeping Texas Texas,” Cruz has said.Cruz only beat Democrat Beto O’Rourke by 3 points in 2018. But Democrats hope that Allred, a former NFL player who flipped a Dallas-area House seat the same year, is a more formidable challenger and can turn out more minority voters. (Allred would be the state’s first Black senator if he wins.)Even Republicans acknowledge that Allred is running a good race, and the NRSC is investing here to help Cruz and the state party. Still, Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, so this remains an uphill battle for Allred.10. MarylandSen. Ben CardinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/GettyImages/FileThe race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin remains in tenth place this month as Angela Alsobrooks fights to keep this seat in party hands. Joe Biden won Maryland by 33 points in 2020, but Republican nominee Larry Hogan – a popular former two-term governor – has a supportive super PAC committing $18 million to tout hisindependence.Alsobrooks, the Prince George’s County executive, led Hogan by 11 points in a recentWashington Post/University of Maryland poll. She’s become better known statewide and has made gains among voters who say they care about Democrats maintaining control of the Senate. The argument that Hogan would be another vote for Senate Republicans has been Democrats’central pitchin deep-blue Maryland, especially onabortion rightsand Trump.Voters in the Post survey were split over whether Hogan would back his party’s leaders in the Senate. He’s winning nearly half of independents, as well as 18% of Democrats. And as he tries to combat Democratic attacks over abortion rights, he’s run ads about being“the ultimate girl dad”and “one of the few Republicans who never caved” to Trump. Hogan rejected the former president’s endorsement earlier this year, but Democrats quickly seized on Trump saying that he’d like to see Hogan win.Maryland’s Future, the super PAC backing Hogan, is trying to localize the race byattacking Alsobrooksfor improperly taking advantage of tax breaks she did not qualify for, as firstreported by CNN. (Her senior adviser told CNN that she was unaware of the problem and that her attorneys are working with both the District of Columbia and Prince George’s County to resolve the issue.)CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report.","Score: 0

cnn,Georgia judge says county election officials cannot delay or decline certification of election results,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/georgia-election-certification-2024/index.html,"CNN—County election officials in Georgia cannot delay or decline to certify election results, a state judge ruled Monday, dealing a blow to an effort by conservatives inthe critical battleground stateto gain the legal right to reject results based on a suspicion of fraud or abuse.“Election superintendents in Georgia have a mandatory fixed obligation to certify election results,” Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote in an 11-page ruling. “Consequently, no election superintendent (or member of a board of elections and registration) may refuse to certify or abstain from certifying election results under any circumstance.”In this November 2022 photo, people wait in line for early voting for the midterm elections at Ponce De Leon Library in Atlanta.Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images/FileRelated articleWhat to know about early voting in Georgia and North CarolinaThe case is one of the closely watched disputes over election certification in the critical battleground state. A ruling is still pending in a separate case brought by state and national Democrats against a rule from the State Election Board that requires local election officials to conduct a “reasonable inquiry” into election results before certifying them.McBurney said in his ruling that while local superintendents have an obligation to “investigate concerns about miscounts,” such concern “is not cause to delay or decline certification.”The case was brought by Julie Adams, a Republican member of the Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections, who had asked the judge to declare that her duties in certifying election results “are discretionary not ministerial.”“If election superintendents were, as Plaintiff urges, free to play investigator, prosecutor, jury, and judge and so – because of a unilateral determination of error or fraud – refuse to certify election results, Georgia voters would be silenced,” McBurney wrote. “Our Constitution and our Election Code do not allow for that to happen.”County election officials face a statutory deadline to certify the election results by November 12 this year.Fulton County has had legitimate problems running its elections and earlier this year the State Election Board reprimanded the county and ordered an independent election monitor because of issues that arose around the 2020 presidential election, including an incident where a batch of ballots were double-scanned during one of the 2020 recounts.But the extensive reviews of Georgia’s 2020 election – which included two machine vote counts and one hand count—did not reveal evidence of widespread fraud. Evidence has not emerged showing tally sheets were tampered with or drop box ballots were improperly taken by couriers, in 2020 or in subsequent elections.The Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Georgia, both of which had intervened in the case – with the backing of Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign – to oppose Adams’ arguments, celebrated the ruling Tuesday as a major legal win.“Election after election, in state after state, we have protected our elections from far-right Republicans trying to disrupt them, and Democrats remain ready to stand up and make sure every voter can cast their ballot knowing it will count. The experts were clear that the 2020 election was free, fair, and secure, and Democrats are making sure that the 2024 is the same,” the groups said in a joint statement.An attorney for Adams has not responded to CNN’s request for comment.In his ruling, McBurney handed Adams a small victory by saying that she had a right to request and receive access to “election information” ahead of certifying the results. But, the judge wrote, “any delay in receiving such information is not a basis for refusing to certify the election results or abstaining from doing so.”McBurney also stressed that concerns over potential election fraud or abuse can be raised by superintendents or others through post-certification court challenges known as “election contests.”“Importantly, election contests occur in open court, under the watchful eye of a judge and the public,” he wrote. “The claims of fraud from one side are tested by the opposing side in that open court – rather than being silently ‘adjudicated’ by a superintendent outside the public space, resulting in votes being excluded from the final count without due process being afforded those electors.”This story has been updated with additional developments.","Score: -1

cnn,"Why the Harris campaign has spent $11 million on a Facebook page with 1,000 followers",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/daily-scroll-facebook-harris-campaign-ads/index.html,"CNN—As Donald Trump and Kamala Harris feverishly chase undecided voters in the final stretch of the presidential campaign, millions of people in battleground states are being served ads on Facebook and Instagram from an obscure page calling itself “The Daily Scroll.”The social media ads, which are adorned with a nondescript logo resembling a pair of checkmarks, have promoted news articles from mainstream outlets including CNN, ABC and NBC, showing easing US inflation, cheaper insulin prices, and the consequences of state abortion bans.But the ads on Meta-owned platforms aren’t being paid for by any news outlet — they’re a product of Harris’ presidential campaign, which has spent heavily on social media platforms and embraced influencers to power her online efforts against Trump.Since Harris launched her bid for president this summer, her campaign has spent more than $11 million on Facebook and Instagram ads to promote The Daily Scroll into users’ feeds, a CNN analysis found. That made it the second biggest page by spending on political or social issues ads in the last 90 days, after only Harris’ main campaign page.A screenshot of The Daily Scroll, a Facebook page managed by the Harris for President campaign.From FacebookThe Harris campaign spent another $900,000 on ads from a similar news aggregator page dubbed “Headlines 2024.”The ads promoting The Daily Scroll have appeared on screens at least 700 million times, according to data from Meta’s Ad Library, with about 97% of views coming from seven battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina.All the ads include a disclaimer that they are “paid for by Harris for President,” and they do not appear to violate Meta’s rules for political advertisers.The Daily ScrollandHeadlines 2024pages are just a small part of a much wider effort to reach undecided voters across all forms of media, Kevin Munoz, a Harris campaign spokesperson, told CNN. Promoting news stories is just one of many digital strategies the campaign is using, in addition to traditional online display ads and short video clips to target voters on YouTube and other platforms, he said.A screenshot shows a ProPublica story shared on The Daily Scroll's Instagram story feature.From InstagramOverall, the Harris campaign has far outspent the Trump campaign on Meta’s platforms, spending nearly $80 million on ads since this summer, compared with about $9.4 million from Trump’s campaign and associated fundraising committees.Unlike the Harris campaign’s main Facebook and Instagram accounts, the ads run by The Daily Scroll and Headlines 2024 aren’t soliciting donations, and most of them aren’t directing users to the campaign’s website. Instead, the Harris team is using the ads to promote select news stories from major media outlets that reflect well on the Democratic presidential nominee and poorly on Trump.In recent months, the campaign has spent more than $2 million on The Daily Scroll to promotean ABC News storyabout slowing inflation — a major voter concern ahead of the election — which was viewed about 120 million times by Facebook and Instagram users in battleground states, according to the Meta database.A Harris campaign advertisement on Facebook promoting an ABC News report on cooling inflation.From Facebook“Good news for consumers – price increases have cooled significantly as inflation reaches the lowest point in over three years,” the ads declared.Other news reports promoted by the page includean NBC News articleon Trump boasting that his crowd sizes rivaled that of Martin Luther King Jr., aCNN videoof Harris speaking the day after Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, and astory from The Guardianreporting that the Project 2025 conservative policy blueprint will “gut labor rights.” The campaign spent more than $300,000 on ads promoting each of those reports.While the thousands of ads in the social media campaign have appeared in users’ feeds hundreds of millions of times, The Daily Scroll account itself appears dormant, with only a handful of public posts and roughly 1,000 followers. Headlines 2024 is even more sparse, with only about 100 followers and no posts at all. This is because Meta allows advertisers to run ads that don’t appear on the main feeds of the pages they are associated with.“The ads are clearly labeled as being paid for by the Harris campaign; there is nothing obviously deceptive about them,” said Peter Loge, director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, who previously worked in the Obama administration. “There is no generic-sounding PAC associated with them.”","Score: -1

But you don’t have to rely on investigative reporting or the memoirs of former administration officials to know that Trump went after political opponents as president.He often went after them in public, too.As CNN reporter Marshall Cohen hasnoted, there is a long list of political opponents whom Trump publicly called for the Justice Department and others to investigate or prosecute. The list includes not only 2016 election opponentHillary Clintonand 2020 election opponentJoe Bidenbut alsoBiden’s son Hunter Biden,Democratic former Secretary of State John Kerry,Trump’s former national security advisor turned critic John Bolton,Democratic former President Barack Obama,unspecified Obama administration officials,the anonymous author of a New York Times op-ed by a Trump administration official critical of Trump,MSNBC host and Trump critic Joe Scarborough,former FBI director turned Trump critic James Comey,other former FBI officials,former British spy Christopher Steele(the author of a controversial dossier of allegations against Trump), and various congressional Democrats – includingformer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,Rep. Adam Schiff of California,Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota,Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, andSen. Mark Warner of Virginia.Asked for comment for this article on Monday, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk accused the media of having a biased “double standard” and said “it is indisputable that under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s DOJ, the Republican nominee for president was targeted and indicted, while under President Trump, nothing like that ever transpired against either of the Democrats he faced off with in 2016 or 2020.”But that wasn’t for a lack of Trump trying.Trump repeatedly pressured the Justice Department as president to prosecute both Clinton and Biden, in addition totrying to get foreign countries to investigate Biden. That the Trump-era Justice Department declined to charge Clinton and Biden doesn’t mean it’s true that Trump didn’t “go after” them or others. (In fact, Trumpliterally saidin 2017 that he wanted the department to be “going after” Clinton.)John Kelly, whom Trump appointed as Secretary of Homeland Security and then White House chief of staff,told The New York Times in 2023of Trump: “He was always telling me that we need to use the FBI and IRS to go after people – it was constant and obsessive and is just what he’s claiming is being done to him now.”And contrary to Vance’s claim to Raddatz that Harris has herself tried to arrest political opponents, which Van Kirk echoed in her Monday statement to CNN, there is no public evidence that Harris pressured the Justice Department to prosecute Trump or her other opponents. The decision to bring two criminal cases against Trump – one over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and one over his post-presidency retention of classified documents – was made by a special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland.Trump made many public calls for investigations and prosecutions of political opponentsOn some occasions, Trump’s calls for investigations, arrests or prosecutions of his political opponentssoundedmore like vague gripesthan sincere attempts to prompt official action. On numerous occasions, though, Trump applied explicit, sustained public pressure on the Justice Department in general or his attorney general to pursue his opponents.For example, in 2017 and 2018, Trump frequently harangued then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions in tweets and public remarks to investigate various allegations against Clinton.“Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes,” hewrotein one tweet. “So where is the investigation A.G.,” hewrotein another tweet. “So many people are asking why isn’t the A.G. or Special Council (sic) looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes,” hewrotein another tweet. Inyet anothertweet, he noted allegations about Clinton, then wrote that “at some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper.”Trump made a directpublic requestin 2019 for Ukraine and China to launch investigations into Joe Biden and Hunter Biden – after he was already facing criticism forprivately pressuring Ukraine to investigate them. And in 2020, Trumppublicly demandedthat then-Attorney General William Barr indict Joe Biden, Obama and unspecified others over their supposed roles in the investigation into his 2016 campaign’s links to Russia.“Unless Bill Barr indicts these people for crimes, the greatest political crime in the history of our country, then we’re going to get little satisfaction unless I win and we’ll just have to go – because I won’t forget it. But these people should be indicted. This was the greatest political crime in the history of our country. And that includes Obama and it includes Biden,” Trumpsaid.Trump privately pressured the Justice DepartmentTrump suggested in that Fox News interview that he might have raised the subject of Biden and Obama indictments with Barr, saying, “I’ll be honest with you, he’s got all the information he needs. They want to get more, more, more, they keep getting more. I said, ‘You don’t need any more. You’ve got more stuff than anybody’s ever had.’”Trump privately pressured the Justice Department and Trump administration officials to go after other political opponents, according to former officials and news reports. And it appears he was sometimes successful, though it’s impossible to definitively prove a direct relationship between his demands and the department’s actions.Sessionstold special counsel Robert Muellerthat Trump pressured him in 2017 to abandon hisrecusalfrom investigations related to the 2016 election in order to prosecute Clinton, according to the Mueller report. Sessions did not do that, but heannounced in March 2018that he had (in November 2017) appointed a federal prosecutor to look into a variety of allegations against Clinton. She wasnever charged.The New York Timesreported this yearthat in April 2018, Trump told aides that if Sessions didn’t prosecute Clinton and Comey, Trump would prosecute them himself – prompting his White House counsel to write him a memo outlining the limits of the president’s powers.Boltonwrotein a 2020 book that Trump was “obsessed” with having Kerry prosecuted for supposedlybreaking a rarely enforced old lawbyremaining in contactwith Iranian officials after leaving office to try to preserve the nuclear agreement Kerry helped to negotiate. Bolton wrote that “in meeting after meeting in the Oval (Office), Trump would ask Attorney General William Barr or anybody listening to launch a prosecution.”The same week in 2018 that Trump tweeted that Kerry might have broken the law, the Justice Department assigned federal prosecutors to investigate Kerry,according to a bookby former federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman, who wasousted by Trump in 2020. Then, the same day Trump tweeted about Kerry in 2019, a Justice Department official called one of the prosecutors to apply more pressure over the case, Berman wrote. Kerry was never charged.In 2019, Barr satisfied Trump’s investigate-the-investigators demand bytaskinga federal prosecutor to help investigate the origins of the FBI’s probe related to Russia and the 2016 election. In late 2020, with about three months left in Trump’s presidency, Barr gave that prosecutor, John Durham,the status of special counsel.And in early 2020, Barrtaskeda different federal prosecutor with taking in information from members of the public,notably including then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, related to allegations about the Bidens and Ukraine, which had been a subject of Trump’s public and private focus.","Score: -1

cnn,"Democrats outspend Republicans on airwaves in crucial House races, with California and New York leading the way",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/house-election-tv-advertising/index.html,"CNN—Democrats have outspent Republicans ontelevision advertisementsin the races that will be crucial to decidingcontrol of the US House of Representatives, with California and New York seeing the highest spending by the two parties, according to a CNN analysis of advertising data from the first full month following the end of primary season.Both California and New York, while deep-blue at the statewide level, are home to buckets of highly competitive House seats that were key to Republicans gaining their narrow majority two years ago.Outside groups are playing an influential role in the race for the House, with a pair of leading super PACs from both parties collectively accounting for about a quarter of the $378 million in ad spending, while a wild card – a super PAC funded by cryptocurrency interests, which backs a bipartisan slate of pro-crypto candidates – dumped nearly $15 million more into the advertising fray.And the ads from some of the top spenders reflects the key issues that are driving voters, including the economy – always a top concern – as well as abortion rights, immigration, and crime.California and New YorkBetween September 11, the day after the last US House primaries finalized general election matchups across the country, and October 10, California and New York combined to draw about 29% of all ad spending targeting House races. Ten House races in California and six in New York are currently rated as competitive byInside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales.Republicans in both states are defending several seats that are held by lawmakers who won close contests in 2022 but thatJoe Bidenwould have carried two years earlier under the current lines.In New York, they include the 4th Congressional District, held by freshman Rep.Anthony D’Esposito, and a pair of upstate seats also represented by first-term lawmakers, Marc Molinaro (19th District) and Mike Lawler (17th District).The GOP is also trying to hold on to several competitive seats in California, mostly in territory that backed Biden in 2020. The vulnerable members include a pair of Central Valley congressmen – Reps. David Valadao of the 22nd District and John Duarte of the 13th District. Also on the list are Reps. Mike Garcia of the 27th District and Michelle Steel of the 45th District, both in the Los Angeles area, and Rep. Kevin Calvert, whose 41st District in the Inland Empire would have narrowly supportedDonald Trumpfour years ago.Top contestsWith those series of highly competitive contests beckoning, both California and New York have been flooded with ad money from outside groups, while grassroots donors, responding to battleground appeals, have helped the candidates push ad spending totals even higher. California, in particular, saw twice as much House ad spending in the month since the last primaries as any other state.And in the top 20 House contests for ad spending between September 11 and October 10, Democrats combined to outspend Republicans in 17 of them by a net of more than $30 million in total.The three races where Republicans led in ad spending wereNebraska’s 2nd District, California’s 22nd and Iowa’s 3rd – all three seats that the party is defending.In a few races – such as D’Esposito’s seat in New York; Duarte’s seat in California; Pennsylvania’s 7th District held by three-term Democratic Rep. Susan Wild; Colorado’s 8th District, home to freshman Democrat Yadira Caraveo; and Washington’s 3rd District, where Democratic Rep.Marie Gluesenkamp-Perezis seeking a second term – Democrats established large advertising leads in the first full month following the primaries, ranging from about $3 million to $4 million.Across all House races, a few leading outside groups from both parties accounted for a significant share of the ad spending totals. Congressional Leadership Fund, the top House GOP super PAC, spent nearly $60 million, 16% of the total in the month, while its Democratic counterpart, House Majority PAC, spent about $35.5 million, which was 9% of the ad spending total on House races over the 30-day period.Top advertisers and issuesCollectively, Congressional Leadership Fund and House Majority PAC accounted for more than a quarter of all the ad spending in the first full month since the last primaries, and the content of their TV ads reflects the messaging priorities for both parties.According to AdImpact data, Congressional Leadership Fund spent about $42 million on broadcast TV ads in those 30 days, and 39% went to ads that referencedimmigration, the top ranked issue in its advertising; CLF also spent more than a quarter of its total ad budget on spots that referencedcrime, and alsotaxes.On the other side, House Majority PAC spent more than $25 million on broadcast TV ads over the same period, and abortion rights dominated its TV ads more than any other issues by a wide margin – about 71% of the super PAC’s broadcast TV spend went to ads referencingabortion. HMP also spent nearly 40% of its TV ad budget on spots referencing crime, in many cases warning against thecriminalizationof abortion, while ads aboutcharacteraccounted for about 17% of its spending.In addition, Fairshake, a super PAC funded by cryptocurrency interests, has seized an influential role in the campaign, spending nearly $15 million since the final primaries on ads backing a bipartisan slate of industry-friendly candidates in 17 races. The spots praise the candidates’economic policiesand legislative records onother key issues.Looking aheadCampaigns and outside groups routinely book advertising time far in advance, and those future ad reservations are subject to change as candidates and their allies adjust their bookings and spend more campaign money.With three weeks to go before votes are counted in the 2024 election, though, House races in California and New York were poised to continue dominating the landscape, while Democrats held an overall edge in remaining future ad reservations.Including bookings between October 11 and Election Day, all advertisers in House races have combined ad reservations totaling more than $441 million, and Democrats lead Republicans by about $252 million to $183 million.California alone was set to see more than $89 million worth of advertising for House races over the final three and half weeks, while New York was set for more than $50 million – together, about a third of all the ad spending targeting the battle for the House in the crucial final stretch.","Score: 0

cnn,Fact check: What Trump keeps getting wrong about ‘paper ballots’,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/fact-check-trump-paper-ballots/index.html,"WashingtonCNN—After losing the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump has championed the baseless lie that the results were tainted by widespread fraud.To fix this made-up problem, Trump has proposed a four-part solution: The US should switch exclusively to paper ballots, requireproof of citizenshipto register to vote, require voters to show ID at the polls, and eliminate mail-in voting by holding the entire election in-person on just one day.Policymakers can debate the merits of forcing voters to prove their citizenship and provide ID. And mail-in voting, widely used by both Democrats and Republicans, isn’t going anywhere.But Trump’s comments on “paper ballots” havepuzzled voting expertsand election officials – because almost all voters nationwide already use paper ballots.Facts First:Trump’s insistence that the US switch to “paper ballots” is nonsensical. More than 98% of voters live in jurisdictions that produce fully auditable paper trails, according todata from Verified Voting, which tracks election equipment in every county.Trump brings up his four-part proposal almost every time he speaks about election integrity. He has mentioned the “paper ballots” claimdozens of timesthis year alone.“We’re going to fix our elections so that our elections are going to be honorable and honest, and people leave, and they know their vote is counted,” Trump said at anAugust rallyin Potterville, Michigan. “We are going to have free and fair elections. And ideally, we go to paper ballots, same-day voting, proof of citizenship – very big – and voter ID.”In aninterviewlast month, Trump said one way to “solve this problem” of mass fraud was to “go to paper ballots.” At arallyin Johnstown, Pennsylvania, he said, “we want to go to paper ballots.” And hesaid, “we want paper ballots,” in Montezuma Pass, Arizona.Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group, has spent the past two decades urging counties to move away from paperless voting in favor of in-person polling sites. (Vote-by-mail obviously incorporates a paper trail.) The people who run the group say they have accomplished their goal – despite claims from Trump and others that the US still needs paper ballots.“It’s really weird and I don’t understand it,” said Mark Lindeman, the group’s director for policy and strategy. “Almost everybody votes on paper ballots. Anyone who is convinced that we need paper ballots is very likely voting on paper ballots themselves.”Only about 1.4% of registered voters live in counties where there’s no paper trail of their ballot if they vote in-person, according to Verified Voting’s data. (If they vote-by-mail, then there is a paper trail.) These holdouts are the entire state of Louisiana and a few Texas counties.For everyone else, there are paper trails that can be checked during a post-election audit or recount.Nearly 70% of registered voters live in counties where voters physically mark their choices on a paper ballot.Another 25% of voters live in counties that use “ballot-marking devices,” where voters use a touchscreen or another interface to select their candidates, and then the machine fills out a paper ballot to reflect their selections.The remaining 5% of voters use electronic machines that record votes directly into the computer’s memory. But even most of these machines now create paper trails, too. The holdout counties in Texas and the entire state of Louisiana only store the votes on the computer memory.The share of voters in “paperless” counties has been steadily shrinking with every election cycle over the past 20 years, according to Verified Voting.Sherry Poland, elections director in Hamilton County, Ohio, which includes Cincinnati, said her county switched to hand-marked paper ballots in 2006, and that the system creates a “backup” and “redundancy” that should inspire confidence in the integrity of the process.“The trend is coming back now and everyone is realizing the value of having a paper trial,” said Poland, a Republican.After the 2016 election, battleground states like Pennsylvania andGeorgiatransitioned away from paperless machines and now use systems with paper trails. And since 2020, Tennessee and many counties in New Jersey, Texas, and Mississippi made the switch too.False and nonsensical claims about election procedures have had a negative impact on voter perceptions on the integrity of US elections, especially among Republicans.A majority of Trump supporters in Michigan, Arizona, and Pennsylvania now say they’re “not at all confident” or only “just a little” confident the results will be accurately tallied in their state, according torecent CNN polling. And one in five of Trump supporters said in a recentABC/Ipsos pollthat they aren’t prepared to accept the results of the election.“Twenty years ago, Verified Voting was founded to get rid of paperless (voting machines),” Lindeman said.“And now we’ve just about made it. We’re wondering why everybody isn’t happier.We’ve done this incredible thing together as a country.”","Score: -1

cnn,Harris warns ‘unhinged’ Trump is out for total power,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/harris-trump-unhinged-analysis/index.html,"CNN—Kamala Harris isresponding to Democratic panicabout her White House prospects by turning up the heat on Donald Trump.The vice president warned Monday that the ex-president was “unstable,” “unhinged” and out for “unchecked power” as she sent a jolt of urgency though her campaign with21 days to go.“Watch his rallies. Listen to his words. He tells us who he is, and he tells us what he would do if he is elected president,” Harris told a large crowd in Pennsylvania after a weekend when Trump’s authoritarian rhetoric reached chilling new levels and hinted at the extreme nature of his potential second term.Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, meanwhile, went even further, suggesting the ex-president’s musings about using the military against domestic foes he branded“the enemy from within”could even amount to treason.Democratic presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally at the Williams Arena at Minges Coliseum on the campus of East Carolina University October 13.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesRelated articleHarris uses Trump’s ‘enemy from within’ comment to portray GOP rival as dangerous and unstableHarris and her team also aggressively questioned Trump’s mental fitness and his capacity to serve another term, turning the tables on the Republican nominee who for months leveled similar charges at President Joe Biden.In another effort by Harris to ease concerns about her apparently stalled momentum, she announceda major new initiativeto court Black male voters amid anxiety that Trump is making inroads into a critical Democratic support base or that they simply won’t turn out.And in a new ad campaign in swing state Arizona, Harris made fresh attempts to win over Republicans alienated by the ex-president’s behavior but who have yet to make what is for many a wrenching decision to cross party lines. To that end, Harris also announced that she’d sit down for her first formal interview with Fox News, dropping her earlier reticence over unscripted events to create a contrast with Trump, who rarely leaves the conservative media bubble.Former President Donald Trump holds a town hall in Oaks, Pennsylvania, on October 14, 2024.Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesA battle for PennsylvaniaHarris’ new efforts to dictate the pace of the election’s endgame came as both candidates campaigned in opposite corners of Pennsylvania. The commonwealth’s 19 electoral votes could well decide who wins the White House and, like a handful of other battlegrounds, it’s a toss-up according to latest polls.Harris is entering the decisive stretch of her political life. Her actions under the most intense pressure in the next three weeks will be watched by remaining voters who’ve yet to make up their minds and may be looking for a reason to pick her. She needs to also energize wavering or unenthusiastic Democratic-leaning voters who may not show up on Election Day.More broadly, the vice president faces one of the most daunting political assignments in decades, after taking over from Biden as the Democratic candidate months before the election. She’s trying to convince a disgruntled electorate that she’s a change candidate despite being part of an unpopular administration, while trying to take down Trump, who has shown there is almost nothing he won’t do to win back power.Yet Harris’ efforts to close the deal against the former president are being complicated by his refusal to meet her for a second debate after her strong performance in their first showdown in September gave her campaign a boost.An image of former President Donald Trump appears on screen as Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, on October 14, 2024.Jacquelyn Martin/AP‘You heard his words’In a new section of her stump speech, Harris played a tape for her rowdy crowd in Erie featuring Trump’s comment on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that he could turn the National Guard or regular military on “the enemy from within.”“You heard his words,” Harris said. “He’s talking about the enemy within Pennsylvania … he considers anyone who doesn’t support him or who will not bend to his will an enemy of our country.” The vice president added: “Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged, and he is out for unchecked power.”Just before Harris spoke, her running mate unveiled the Democratic ticket’s most explicit assessment yet of Trump’s potential threat to basic political freedoms if he wins a second term. Walz, the Minnesota governor, said the idea a president could use troops against Americans made him “sick to my stomach.”And the Army National Guard veteran highlighted a comment by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley that Trump was a “fascist to his core,” which was reported in Bob Woodward’s new book “War.” Walz added: “Let that sink in, and don’t be a damn bit afraid of saying it, because that’s exactly who he is. That’s exactly who he is.”Trump’s vice presidential nominee JD Vance, however, defended his boss’ remarks. “Is it a justifiable use of those assets if they’re rioting and looting and burning cities down to the ground? Of course it is. Right?” the Ohio senator said in Minneapolis. “I think the question is, is it a justifiable use of assets? Depends on what’s actually happening.”Video Ad FeedbackWhy former defense secretary fears Trump would try to utilize military against US citizens03:28- Source:CNNIntensifying Democratic rhetoric about Trump comes as Democrats begin to consider the implications of the ex-president winning a toss-up election and securing a second term that is likely to be even less restrained that his first. Former President Barack Obama set the tone during his own swing through Pennsylvania last week.Harris suggested in an interview with Roland Martin that Trump had something to hide. “He will not debate me again. I’ve put out my medical records, he won’t put out his medical records. And you have to ask, why is his staff doing that? And it may be because they think he’s just not ready, and unfit, and unstable, and should not have that level of transparency for the American people.”In an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” second gentleman Doug Emhoff raised questions about the 78-year-old former president’s mental and physical condition. Like his wife did, he noted that Trump had backed out of a “60 Minutes” interview and said, “It’s just obvious by looking at him, listening to him, you can see the degradation in front of your eyes.”He added: “He’s a degrading version of an already horrible person so he’s just getting worse and worse.”Vice President Kamala Harris greets the crowd at a rally, in Erie, Pennsylvania, on October 14, 2024.Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersA critical county that could decide the electionAt her rally in Erie, Harris put on an energetic show that looked like an attempt to ease Democratic anxiety that the momentum she built up after taking over from Biden in July has not translated into a clear lead over the ex-president.“We will win. We will win,” she insisted with a beaming smile.Erie County, in far northwestern Pennsylvania, is a study in miniature of the wider strategic nationwide battle facing Harris and Trump in the next three weeks. Biden won the county by 1 percentage point in 2020, but the former president carried the county by nearly 2,000 votes in 2016 on the way to the White House. The city of Erie is a Democratic stronghold, but the fight between Harris and Trump will be intense among moderate voters in the suburbs and Trump will seek to run up huge margins in rural and farming communities.The twice-impeached former president appeared at a town hall event in Oaks, northeast of Philadelphia, with South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who is a star in the conservative media firmament.The event highlighted issues like the cost of living and housing that Trump’s team sees as the key to the election. One of the most critical questions before undecided voters in the coming days is whether pressures bearing down on many American families — for instance, over high grocery prices – will outweigh concerns about Trump’s extremism and threats to democracy.Harris was not the only candidate tending to a vital constituency on Monday. (She unveiled a plan to boost access to finance for Black men who want to start businesses and a health initiative to increase screenings for conditions that disproportionately affect the community). Trump sought to make inroads with young men who are often low-propensity voters but who could add to his coalition.He appeared on the Nelk Boys’ “Full Send” podcast, which has more than 2 million subscribers on YouTube, and chatted authoritatively about UFC martial arts stars in exchanges that displayed the kind of authenticity many voters like. He also appeared to confirm that he would appear on Joe Rogan’s hugely popular podcast in the latest example of how both he and Harris are seeking out non-traditional media sources to reach Americans who often don’t vote.","Score: -1

cnn,Why working-class White women could be so decisive this fall,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/female-voters-decisive-election-blue-wall-states/index.html,"CNN—There is one conspicuous weak spot in the formidable wall of supportVice President Kamala Harrishas built among female voters. And that opening may representformer President Donald Trump’s best chance to tip the states that remain most likely to decidethe razor-thin presidential race.Even as Trump struggled with other groups of women in his 2016 and 2020 presidential races, exit polls and other analyses showed that he amassed a big lead each time among White women without a college education.Those working-class White women loom as a critical, potentially even decisive, factor in Trump’s third White House bid. That’s partly because so many of them, polls show, are torn between personal disdain for Trump and discontent with the results ofJoe Biden’s presidency, particularly over inflation and the border.But it’s also because these women are especially plentiful in the three former “blue wall” states that stillconstitute Harris’ most likely pathto an Electoral College victory: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. To win those states, which she is barnstorming every day this week, Harris doesn’t have to win most of those women – Democrats almost never do – but she does need to remain competitive with them.“They are really tired of Trump, and they’d really like to move on, but they are also nervous about moving on, and they do think the economy was better for them under Trump,” said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. As for Harris, Lake said, “They like she would bring everybody together, they like her empathy. … But they don’t feel that they know her that well.” The sum total of these contradictory impulses is that, “They are really torn,” Lake said. “They feel very insecure about these choices.”One measure of how much Democrats prioritize these blue-collar White women is the massive voter contact program that American Bridge 21st Century, a party super PAC, is targeting at them. The group is spending about $140 million to try to reach 3 million women, predominantly White women without a college degree, just in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the three states that Trump in 2016 knocked out ofwhat I termed the “blue wall.”Vice President Kamala Harris attends a campaign event in Flint, Michigan, on October 4, 2024.Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters“In general, the blue wall states are still the path of least resistance to 270” for Harris, said Bradley Beychok, a co-founder of American Bridge 21st Century. “But I think it’s pretty clear that women are the determinative demographic of this election cycle, and they have been the last few election cycles, so it’s not rocket science.”American Bridge has pursued these blue-collar women through an extraordinarily long engagement that began in 2023 by regularly mailing them newspapers produced by an affiliated group. The effort has included multiple rounds of contacts and testimonial ads from former Trump voters delivered through every available platform, from television and digital to mail and streaming services. Beychok said one of the group’s strongest messages is reminding voters of the uncertainty and volatility that comes with Trump.Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a rally at the Dort Financial Center in Flint, Michigan, on October 4.Mark Schiefelbein/APRelated articleHarris advisers zero in on Michigan strategy to overcome anticipated losses among some parts of Democratic coalition“If you show folks, gee you put this guy back in the White House and you’ll have a sense of unrest and disorder in your community … people say, ‘I don’t want that,’” Beychok said. Similarly, he added, “If Donald Trump is proud that he made good on his threat to ban abortion, and overthrow Roe v. Wade, and you know he’s an agent of chaos, then what [rights] will” he threaten next?Beychok said the group’s guiding principle is that even small gains with these women can prove decisive across narrowly divided states. “We may not get to 50.1 with them, but if we run a program to get what is available to us … it can be just as effective,” he said.In fact, winning a majority of these women has not been a realistic goal for Democrats. In exit polls dating to 1980, the only Democratic presidential nominee who carried even a plurality of White women without a college degree on a national basis was Bill Clinton in 1996. Democrats stayed close among these women again in the razor-thin 2000 race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. But while White womenwitha college degree have trended toward the Democrats in the presidential campaigns since then, the White womenwithouta college degree have moved sharply in the opposite direction.The Republican presidential nominees won just under three-fifths of these working-class White women in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 races, while Trump pushed his share with them over three-fifths in both the 2016 and 2020 races, according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. Other well-respected analyses of the 2016 and 2020 vote likewise showed Trump winning about three-fifths of these women,with the Democratic targeting firm Catalistputting Trump just below that threshold each time,and the Pew Research Center’s Validated Votersstudy putting Trump just underneath it in 2016 and just above it in 2020.Supporters of former President Donald Trump cheer during a campaign rally on October 9, 2024, in Reading, Pennsylvania.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe GOP advantage in those national figures is inflated by its imposing advantage among these women in Southern states, where many of them are culturally conservative evangelical Christians who support the GOP in overwhelming numbers.Critically for Democrats, in the pivotal battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, they have usually run a few points better with these women than they do nationally. In Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection victory, for instance, he only won about one-third of these women nationally, but he carried about 45% of them in both Michigan and Pennsylvania and won a narrow majority of them in Wisconsin, the exit polls found. By contrast, in 2016, Hillary Clinton,the exit polls found, stalled out at around 40% support from them in all three states, which contributed to her losing Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by a combined margin of roughly 80,000 votes – and with them the presidency.Compared with Clinton in 2016,Biden in 2020 posted a small but critical improvement among these women in Michigan and Wisconsin, contributing to his victories there,exit polls found. Biden ran only about as well as Clinton did with them in Pennsylvania, where he flipped the state primarily by vastly expanding on her margin in the heavily college-educated suburbs of Philadelphia.GREENVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA - OCTOBER 13: Democratic presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally at the Williams Arena at Minges Coliseum on the campus of East Carolina University October 13, 2024 in Greenville, North Carolina. With 22 days until the election, recent polls in North Carolina show Harris and her opponent Republican presidential candidate, former President Donald Trump within just a point or two on average, which is also the case in the other six key battleground states. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesRelated articleHarris unveils new proposals targeting Black men as she looks to shore up Democratic coalitionWorking-class White women in the former blue wall states may be even more central to Harris’ fate than they were to Biden’s. Even most Democrats acknowledge Harris may struggle to fully match Biden’s showing among almost all the major groups of male voters, especially White men without a college degree, as well as Black, Latino and younger men.Because Biden won Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by a combined margin of nearly 260,000 votes, Harris has a cushion to sustain some erosion among men. But Lake, like many other Democrats, believes that to win the three big Rust Belt battlegrounds – and for that matter,anyof the swing states – Harris will likely need to run at least slightly better than Biden did among women. “She is going to have to do better with women,” Lake said flatly. “She has to make up for the fact that she won’t do as well with the men as he did.”Polls show Harris has a good chance at improving over Biden’s 2020 performance with one group of women in all of the battlegrounds, including the former blue wall states: White women with at least a four-year college degree.In the 2022 midterm – the first election held after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion – the Democratic gubernatorial nominees in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsinall ran notably betteramong these women than Biden had two years earlier.Recent surveys by Quinnipiac Universityshowed Harris also drawing about two-thirds of these college-educated White women in all three of the former blue wall states,as did a recent Wisconsin poll by the Marquette Law School.Harris’ position is less certain among women of color. Many polls have shown her facing some decline compared with 2020 among bothBlackandLatinowomen, but Democrats feel more confident about her ability to regain most of that ground than they do about her odds of undoing the shortfall with minority men, especially Latinos.That leaves the working-class White women as the biggest wild card among female voters.“They are weighing a lot of things,” said Republican pollster Christine Matthews. “They could very well be deliberating up until the very last minute.”Their choices will be especially important in the former blue wall states because the blue-collar White women are so numerous there.In a new analysis shared exclusively with me, William Frey, a demographer at the nonpartisan Brookings Metro think tank, has calculated that these White women without a college degree will comprise a huge share of eligible voters in these pivotal states. According to his analysis of the latest census data, they will represent over one-fourth of adults eligible to vote in both Michigan and Wisconsin and almost exactly one-fourth in Pennsylvania. In all three states, he found they represent roughly as big a share of the eligible voting population as the blue-collar White men who are Trump’s strongest group and a bigger group of eligible voters than either White men or women with a college degree, or non-White men or women. Every vote from every group, of course, counts the same, but the blue-collar White women are a big enough bloc that even minuscule shifts in their preference, or turnout, could easily tip these precariously balanced states.One word from Trump’s speech during a recent Wisconsin rally offers the best window on how he is pursuing these working-class White women. Talking about undocumented migrants, he declared, “They will walk into your kitchen, they’ll cut your throat.” Trump didn’t say immigrants would walk through the front door or into the living room. He specifically said they would come into akitchen, where many women, particularly in working-class households, can easily envision themselves alone and vulnerable.Former President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Dodge County Airport on October 6, 2024, in Juneau, Wisconsin.Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APThat was just one salvo in the barrage of messaging from Trump and his allies – in speeches and in advertising – that seeks to simultaneously trigger fears of crime from undocumented immigrants, portray Harris as too weak and too liberal to protect people from it, and to present himself as the strongman, in all senses of that word, who can provide that protection.Jackie Payne is the founder and executive director of Galvanize Action, a liberal group that studies moderate White women, primarily those without college degrees. She acknowledges that Trump’s alarms have resonated among working-class White women, especially older ones. These women, she said, “express some of the fear around the border crisis; safety and security of their family is a top priority, and they identify the border crisis as a threat.”But at the same time, Payne said, for many of these women, the vehemence and vitriol of Trump’s attacks on immigrants –the dehumanizing language and lurid accusations– is also triggering their greatest concern about him: that he’s too divisive, disruptive and chaotic.Trump, Payne said, is “making the bet” that voters fearful about their safety will accept language and threats from him about immigrants that they consider “ugly” if they believe such vehemence to be “ the price of strength and protection.” But, she added, “At the same time, we see a revulsion and disgust at the way we are talking about other humans.”Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania Ed Fry Arena, Monday, Sept. 23, 2024, in Indiana, Pa. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)Alex Brandon/APRelated articleThe unexpected gender dynamic shaping the 2024 electionTrump’s other big asset with these women is the economy. Many working-class White women live with very little economic margin, and pollsters agree the cumulative increase under Biden in the cost of living – notwithstanding inflation’s decline over recent months – has almost eclipsed any of his other economic accomplishments, such as the strong job market.“If you are just getting by and living paycheck to paycheck, that increase in basic groceries did a number on you and you are very focused on the economy,” said GOP pollster Jon McHenry.McHenry said in his polling, significantly more of these blue-collar women say they were doing better economically under Trump than Biden.The latest national New York Times/Siena surveyreinforces that finding: Among White women without a college degree, 54% said Trump’s policies had helped them personally, while a nearly identical 53% said Biden’s policies had hurt them, according to unpublished results provided by Siena. These women may feel a stronger personal connection with Harris than they did with Biden, McHenry noted, but poll results such as those make clear they don’t believe “that things are magically better because Joe Biden withdrew from the election. They are still feeling the effects of inflation; they are still not happy about the border.”College-educated White women don’t give Biden’s policies great ratings in the Times/Siena poll either. But both Mathews and Payne point out that’s almost irrelevant to the decision for most of them: Trump himself provides the motivation for their vote. “When I look at White college women, I see them as motivated by choice, abortion and defeating Donald Trump,” said Matthews. “They are negatively motivated by him; they want him gone.”In the 2022 exit polls, a solid majority of blue-collar White women also backed abortion rights across Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to results provided by the CNN polling unit. The Democrats’ problem is not that these women don’t support legal abortion; it’s that fewer of them prioritize it as much as their female counterparts who are college-educated, single or younger.“For White non-college women, even if they are offended by some of this stuff coming out of the Trump and Vance campaigns, the misogynistic comments, they are really focused on being able to feed a family of four on their income,” Matthews said. “They are cross-pressured and they don’t like what they are hearing. But they think he would do better on the economy and prices would go down, and that is the most pressing and relevant issue.”In one of her campaign’s most notable achievements, Harris has become more competitive on economic issues; even if more voters still say they trust Trump to handle the macro-economy, she’s narrowed the gap in multiple polls on questions such as holding down costs or who cares about people like me. Her recent media offensive seemed aimed, above all, at buttressing those perceptions: across the many podcasts, town halls and talk show appearances the most powerful through line in her message seemed to be to say to women: I have lived your life, so I understand what public policy must do to make it easier and more secure – with everything from a restored child tax creditto Medicare coverage for home health carefor more seniors.Supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris hold up signs during a campaign event in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, on September 13, 2024.Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersPayne said the key for Harris is to “at least draw even on ‘you can trust me to deliver for your family.’” If she can do that, Payne said, more working-class women will feel comfortable voting for “a vision of America that they want to raise their kids in. They don’t want conflict, they don’t like the polarization and division.”The toughest question for Democrats is how Harris’ gender may affect the decisions of these working-class White women across the Rust Belt. To this day, some Democrats believe one key reason Clinton narrowly lost the former blue wall states in 2016 was that too many of these women remained uneasy with a female president, particularly around issues of security.In polling this fall, Payne’s group found that Trump holds a big lead over Harris among White women who score high on what social scientists call “internalized sexism” – a tendency to defer to men – while Harris held a commanding lead among those who scored low on that measure.A recent national Gallup Pollpoints in a similar direction. White women without a college degree were far more likely to identify Trump than Harris as a strong leader and someone who would display good judgment in a crisis, according to unpublished results provided by Gallup. Not only college-educated White women, but also the equivalent White men were much more likely than the blue-collar White women to express positive views about Harris and negative ones about Trump, Gallup found.“I think there is a lot of implicit [gender] bias with” these working-class White women, Lake said. “And given the short time frame, I’m not sure we’re on top of it. They have competing notions of Trump. On the one hand, he’s chaotic, unstable, he’s definitely looking older, he is dividing people, he is causing instability in communities. But on the other hand, they think he’s a strong man and they like strong men.”How a few thousand conflicted and ambivalent working-class White women in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin sift through these competing views may decide the statesthat remain the most likely to determine the next president.","Score: -1

cnn,Bob Woodward issues a stark warning on Trump weeks from Election Day,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/bob-woodward-book-review/index.html,"Editor’s Note:The story below contains explicit language.CNN—The arrival of a newBob Woodward bookhas a well-established choreography; enterprising reporters get hold of copies of the heavily embargoed volume a week or so ahead of its publication date and mine it for the news it contains.BothCNNandThe Washington Post,where Woodward retains the honorific title of associate editor, covered the news in the latest book, “War,” last week.And news there was: At the height of the pandemic, PresidentDonald Trumpsent Russian President Vladimir Putin a secret shipment of Covid-19 testing equipment, and since he has left office, Trump has called Putin as many as seven times.Ahead of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, PresidentJoe Bidenblamed former President Barack Obama for not doing more to counter the Russian leader when he invaded Crimea in 2014, telling a friend, “That’s why we are here. We fucked it up. Barack never took Putin seriously.”Putin had a heated call with Biden in the run-up to Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, in which the Russian president threatened a nuclear war. Later, Biden’s national security team assessed there was a 50% chance Putin might use a tactical nuclear weapon during the Ukraine conflict. It is worth noting that back in March, CNN’s Jim Sciutto had similardetailed reportingabout Putin’s possible use of a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine in late 2022.As has been the case for previous Woodward books, those who don’t come out well from his reporting publicly dismiss it. The Trump campaign said: “None of these made-up stories by Bob Woodward are true.”Video Ad FeedbackHarris reacts to claim Trump secretly sent Putin individual Covid tests02:12- Source:CNNThe deluge of publicity that precedes the publication of Woodward’s book ensures that the book shoots to the top of the bestseller lists before Woodward does any media himself. Even before “War”goes on sale Tuesday, it’s already No. 5 on Amazon’s bestseller list, so it could also be on the way to being Woodward’s 16th No. 1 New York Times bestseller, an astonishing record of success.Woodward has a penchant for one-word titles for his books about Trump: “Peril,” “Rage” and “Fear.” He has also written extensively about the post-9/11 wars in books such as “Bush at War” and“Obama’s Wars.” So how does“War” stack up against those books, and what are its big themes?At the heart of “War,” Woodward reports about how Biden’s national security team handled three wars: in Afghanistan, the Ukraine conflict, and the war in Gaza, now in its second year, which has embroiled the Middle East in a widening conflict.Like Woodward’s several other books about war, the front lines of the conflicts he covers are not on the battlefields but in the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room. I reviewedWhite House visitor logsshowing that Robert Woodward (his legal name) visited the White House more than two dozen times from December 2022 to April 2024, a period that “War” covers in detail.Woodward rarely strays far from this apex of American power. As a result, “War” is not suffused with the sound of gunfire, but the ringing of cell phones as senior Biden officials get on secure conference calls.Video Ad FeedbackGangel breaks down most shocking revelations from Woodward's new book06:35- Source:CNNWoodward notes that neither Biden nor Trump spoke to him for this book, but he still got great access. It’s clear from a close reading of “War”that almost every top national security official in the Biden administration spoke with him. Those officials did so surely because they understood that if they didn’t talk to Woodward, their peers certainly would. So, if they wanted to get their version of history told, it only made sense to cooperate with the legendary reporter, who, at age 81, has more energy and puts in more shoe leather than reporters half his age.Typically, in Woodward’s books, he lets his reporting speak for itself and doesn’t make sweeping pronouncements that tell the reader about his own conclusions, but“War”is different. Woodward, who has covered every president since Nixon, writes that Trump is “not only the wrong man for the presidency, he is also unfit to lead the country. Trump was far worse than Richard Nixon, the provably criminal president. … Trump was the most reckless and impulsive president in American history.” Ouch!By contrast, the final sentence of “War”asserts, “Based on the evidence available now, I believe President Biden and this team will be largely studied in history as an example of steady and purposeful leadership.”Biden’s Afghan withdrawal fiascoYet, that conclusion of steady and purposeful leadership is quite at odds with the fiasco of thechaotic US withdrawalfrom Afghanistan in the summer of 2021, which handed the country back to the Taliban, and during which a suicide bomber killed 13 American service members and some 170 Afghans. This was an own goal scored by Biden’s decision to goagainst the advice of his top generals, who told him the withdrawal of the small contingent of 2,500 US troops then in Afghanistan would lead to the collapse of the Afghan military.Collapse it did, and now the Taliban rule over Afghanistan with aniron, misogynistic fistenabled by many billions of dollars of military equipment that the US left behind. The Taliban are also accommodating some 20 terrorist organizations,according to the United Nations.The Afghanistan withdrawal also signaled to Putin that the US was withdrawing from the world in general, which seems to have accelerated his plans to invade Ukraine. Woodward’s reporting underlines this point. He writes that top generals at the Pentagon learned that a few weeks after the Afghanistan withdrawal, “new pieces of intelligence were coming in that suggested Russia was planning a large-scale military attack on Ukraine.”Biden then dispatched CIA Director Bill Burns, who had dealt with Putin during his stint as US ambassador to Russia, to warn the Russian leader that the US knew he was planning an invasion of Ukraine and to try to dissuade him. Along with Burns on the trip to Russia was the National Security Council director for Russia, Eric Green. According to Woodward, Green “picked up a sense that the Russians were feeling kind of full of themselves after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.” Green told Woodward, “I think it reinforced Putin’s conception about how easy it would be. … Here’s a military force that has been supported by the US for decades at that stage. They just collapsed. The Americans didn’t back them up.”Biden gets it right on UkraineBy contrast, the Biden team did show real leadership when it tried to warn the world of Putin’s impending invasion of Ukraine and then, when it happened, steadily supplied the Ukrainians with weapons and substantial aid so that they have held off the Russians for more than two and a half years. This has all been achieved without any American boots on the ground, a key Biden goal for the war.In the lead-up to the invasion of Ukraine, Biden and his team warned in private discussions with the Ukrainians and NATO allies that, based on their intelligence, Putin was close to invading. They also innovated by making this intelligence public. Not surprisingly, this was met with some initial resistance from the US intelligence community, yet it was smart policy. After all, secrecy serves policy; it is not a policy goal in and of itself.On December 3, 2021, The Washington Postran a storyheadlined, “Russia planning a massive military offensive against Ukraine involving 175,000 troops, U.S. intelligence warns.” Although this declassification of intelligence didn’t, in the end, stop Putin from invading Ukraine, it likely made NATO allies and the Ukrainians better prepared for how to respond once the invasion began.Two women watch US President Joe Biden making statements on a news channel in a subway station turned into a shelter in Kyiv on March 8, 2022.Vadim Ghirda/AP/FileIf the Afghanistan withdrawal was a spectacular own goal scored by Biden himself since he was the leading proponent of the policy, the Biden administration’s response to the Ukraine invasion was about as good as it gets. Biden wanted to support the Ukrainians substantially but did not want to trigger World War III inadvertently. That policy has largely been a success. When US intelligence found that Putin was seriously contemplating using a tactical nuclear weapon, the Biden administration “mobilized every communication line, calling the Chinese, the Indians, the Israelis, the Turks — countries friendly with Russia” to get them to tell Putin to stand down. He did.One of Putin’s key goals when he invaded Ukraine was to ensure the country never joined NATO. Instead, because of the invasion, Putin made NATO Great Again. Multiple NATO countries started ramping up their own spending on defense, and the alliance added two new members, the formerly neutral states ofSwedenandFinland, Russia’s neighbor.While the war has stalemated now with a slight advantage to the Russians, who are advancing slowly in eastern Ukraine, in August, the Ukrainians seized hundreds of square miles of territoryin the Kursk regionof Russia itself, which they have retained. No matter how much Putin’s propagandists proclaim that victory is close, the Russians are estimated to have already suffered 600,000 dead and wounded, according to a Pentagon briefing last week.The Middle East regional war Biden tried to avoidA year afterHamas attacked Israel, killing some 1,200 Israelis, the Biden team has not prevented an escalating regional conflict. Instead of showing purposeful leadership, the Biden administration has repeatedly handed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a blank check, which he has used to carry out large-scale attacks not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank and Lebanon, as well as more targeted operations in Syria and Yemen.The war is Gaza has claimed the lives of 42,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, while the death toll in Lebanon is more than 1,500 since Israel launched a ground operation there in recent weeks, and a million Lebanese have fled their homes,according to the UN.President Joe Biden leaves the room at the end of a press conference following a solidarity visit to Israel on October 18, 2023, in Tel Aviv.Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, the Houthis in Yemen have effectively shut down shipping through thekey Red Sea global trade routeusing Iran-supplied missiles and drones and have also fired them at Israel. In the past six months, Iran has launched two massive attacks on Israel using ballistic missiles and drones, widening the war to the regional conflict that the Biden administration was strenuously seeking to avoid when Hamas launched its attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023.The possibility of a ceasefire with Hamas and the return of the hostages held by the terrorist groupseems quite remoteat this point since the leader of Hamas in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, and Netanyahu are unwilling to compromise, and both seem to believe that the continuation of the war benefits their interests.On Sunday, the Israeli Cabinet met to decide how to respond to the most recent Iranian missile strike on Israel two weeks ago. Biden has urged the Israelis not to strike Iranian nuclear sites. Let’s see whether they listen. The record so far has not been encouraging.Biden’s unwavering support for Netanyahu even has a name — “the bear hug”— and while the president has occasionally protested publicly about the level of casualties in Gaza, the de facto policy is strong support for Israel; for instance, the Biden administration is going forward with the sale of $18 billion of F-15 fighter jets to the country.Earlier this year, the Biden administration tried without success to get Netanyahu not to attack the densely populated Gazan city of Rafah, where an estimated 1.5 million Palestinians were sheltering, many of them evicted from their homes earlier in the conflict.Biden called Netanyahu on February 15, 2024, telling him, “We already said we are not going to support an operation absent a plan to get civilians out of harm’s way.” Netanyahu ignored this warning and went ahead with the attack on Rafah. Woodward’s assessment of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s efforts to rein in Netanyahu during this period is damning and direct: “It was obvious Blinken had no influence.”It’s mystifying why the Biden administration hasn’t used more of its considerable leverage over Netanyahu; after all, in the past year, the US has approved $17.9 billion for security assistance to Israel, according to a report by Brown University released last week; the most aid in any year that the US has ever sent to Israel. The Biden administration has halted the shipment of massive 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, but otherwise, the large flow of American weapons to the Jewish state continues.Vice President Kamala HarrisThough Vice President Kamala Harris adorns the cover of “War”— likely a marketing decision given her presidential run — she does not play a prominent role in the book compared with Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and national security adviser Jake Sullivan.Yet, when Harris appears in the book, she does give sound advice. When Biden asked her what her view was in mid-April after Iran had fired some 300 missiles and drones at Israel, almost all of which were then shot down by Israel, the US and other allies, Harris said simply, “Tell Bibi to take the win.”Vice President Kamala Harris gives remarks alongside President Joe Biden at Prince George’s Community College on August 15, 2024, in Largo, Maryland.Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesHarris also has one of the funnier lines in the book, saying Biden likes her company because “he knows that I’m the only person around who knows how to properly pronounce the wordmotherfucker.” Indeed, we learn from Woodward that “Joe from Scranton” sure does use the F-word a lot, particularly when it comes to Netanyahu, who Biden variously describes as one of “the biggest fucking assholes in the world,” “a bad fucking guy” and “a fucking liar.” And for good measure, Biden yells at Netanyahu, “Bibi, what the fuck?” after the Israelisassassinated a Hezbollah leaderliving in a densely populated area of the capital of Lebanon, also killing at least three civilians.“War” is a deeply reported account of the wars on the Biden administration’s watch. At the same time, its overall assessment that the Biden team showed purposeful leadership regarding these conflicts isn’t supported by the facts of the Afghan withdrawal, the present conflagration in the Middle East, and even Woodward’s own reporting. However, regarding Ukraine, the Biden administration has operated very deftly, keeping NATO together and expanding the alliance while avoiding any direct American involvement in the war that might have triggered an escalatory response from the Russians. Certainly, this is a real achievement that Biden can savor when he enjoys his well-earned retirement back in Delaware.It is anyone’s guess what Trump might do about Ukraine if he were to win the presidency, given the former president’s odd bromance with Putin, which even top aides such as Trump’s director of national Intelligence, Dan Coats, cannot explain. Coats told Woodward, “It’s still a mystery to me how he deals with Putin and what he says to Putin. … It’s an enigma, and it hasn’t been broken yet.”Trump has claimed he could quickly settle the Ukraine conflict, but since the Russians and Ukrainians have been at war for a decade since Putin first seized Crimea in 2014, this seems like wishful thinking.","Score: -1

cnn,Why education level has become the best predictor for how someone will vote,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/the-biggest-predictor-of-how-someone-will-vote/index.html,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.WashingtonCNN—American voters are divided in many ways – by gender, by race, by region – and any of these can be used to explain the current state of politics.More women support Democrats, agender gapthat seems likely to widen as the fall of Roe v. Wade turned the US into a country with abortion-rights states and abortion-ban states.The extent to which former President Donald Trump can siphon off support for Vice President Kamala Harris amongvoters of color, Latinos and Black men, in particular, could be consequential in states where close margins are expected.Rural voters generally side with Republicans, urban voters generally side with Democrats and whoever can get an edge in thesuburbswill win in November.But there is an even more important thing dividing voters, according to the longtime Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik, who was former President Bill Clinton’s political director and is known for incisivedeep-dive memos.The education gap grows“The biggest single, best predictor of how someone’s going to vote in American politics now is education level. That is now the new fault line in American politics,” Sosnik told David Chalian on the “CNN Political Briefing” podcast.Trump’s rise over the past three election cycles, Sosnik argued, “accelerated and completed this political realignment based on education that had been forming since the early ’70s, at the beginning of the decline in the middle class.”As the US transitions to a 21st century economy, there’s a rift between the people who attain education – “that’s become the basic Democratic Party,” he said, comparing them with people who feel left behind, “that group of voters is now the modern Republican Party base.”CNN Political BriefingThe Two Things That Will Decide The ElectionElection Day is just a little over three weeks away, and there’s still no clear leader in this race. With Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump still neck-and-neck, all eyes are on the battleground states. Doug Sosnik is a longtime Democratic strategist who’s known for his deep-dive political memos. He joins CNN Political Director David Chalian to share his insights on the current state of play and why he thinks the next 25 days are all about Harris’ ability to close the deal with voters who may not feel naturally aligned with her. He also explains why this election could yield the biggest gender gap in American political history.Oct 11, 2024 • 28 min...Apple PodcastsSpotifyTuneInRadio.comiHeart RadioPandoraAmazonRSSInequality growsThere’s data to back this up, as Sosnik has previouslywritten. In an August report on growing income inequality in the US, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis documented that for every dollar of wealth in a household headed by a college graduate, a household headed by a high school graduate has 22 cents. The figure rises to 30 cents for households headed by someone with some college, but no degree.Put another way, college graduates hold about three-quarters of the wealth in the US, but account for only about 40% of the population.There’s a direct correlation to politics. In 2020, according toCNN’s exit polls, voters with a college degree accounted for 41% of the electorate and they supported President Joe Biden 55% to Trump’s 43%. Trump got the support of about two-thirds of White voters without a college degree, but he lost White college-educated voters.Sorting states by education levelSosnik went a step further, arguing to Chalian that the seven or so battleground states that could be won by either Trump or Harris also tend to be right in the middle on education levels, “not skewing too much college-educated voters and not too much non-college. That’s the only reason they’re different than the rest of the country,” he said.TheLumina Foundationhas a report that uses census data to rank states by educational attainment, including post-high school certifications and associate degrees. It’s true that most of the battlegrounds – Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in the Rust Belt and Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona in the Sun Belt – all fall near the average. There is also one important exception. Nevada, which is a battleground state, has one of of the lowest levels of educational attainment in the US. While most of the states with the highest educational attainment are blue states in the northeast, Utah, a red state, is also near the top of the list.The real swing votersTo the extent that traditional swing voters are persuadable in this election, Sosnik argued they might be people like political independents or Nikki Haley Republicans.But there’s a second group of swing voters Sosnik argued is even more important. Those voters aren’t choosing between a candidate, but rather deciding whether to vote at all.For Trump, these are non-college-educated White voters in general, particularly men, who “if they vote, you know they’re going to vote for Trump,” he said. For Harris, they might be women who don’t normally participate in the process, but will this year, the first presidential election since the Supreme Court allowed some states to ban most or all abortions.Young voters, who are less reliable to cast ballots, also fall into this second type of swing voters, Sosnik said.Trump’s entire success in politics has been built around appealing not to independents, but to those who “aren’t traditional voters,” he said.The educational realignment could also change how we view presidential elections versus off-year midterms, he said.“Up until Trump, Democrats always did better in presidential years because infrequent voters were Democratic,” Sosnik argued. “Republicans always did better in off years because the high propensity voters were Republican. That’s completely flipped on its side now.”Listen to the podcast here.

cnn,Trump’s extreme vision for America hikes pressure on Harris,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/trump-extreme-vision-harris-pressure-analysis/index.html,"CNN—Donald Trumpis invoking a vision of an extreme new White House term that would transform America and rock the world.And Vice President Kamala Harris has only three weeks to avert it, as she struggles to restore momentum in a neck-and-neck race to Election Day.The Republican nominee is escalating the most toxic anti-immigrant rhetoric in modern US history, warning outsiderswith “bad genes”have “invaded” the country afterfalsely claimingthat Haitian migrants here legally were eating pets in Ohio. At a rally in Arizona on Sunday, Trump baselessly suggested that if Harris were elected, “the entire country will be turned into a migrant camp.” In Colorado two days earlier, he again vowed to “begin the largest deportation operation in the history of the United States,” promising, “We will close the border. We will stop the invasion of illegals into our country. We will defend our territory. We will not be conquered.”And he escalated his threats against political opponents this weekend, saying on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures”he could turn the militaryon “the enemy from within.” The ex-president, who incited violence to try to stay in power after the 2020 election, alsosaid at a rally Saturdaythat a heckler exercising the right to free speech should “get the hell knocked out of” her.In another preview of how he could use presidential power to serve his personal and political whims, Trump this weekend threatened to withhold federal disaster aid to Democratic-run California —even as he falsely accusesHarris and PresidentJoe Bidenof doing the same to hurricane-hit Republican districts. Trump also said CBS should lose its license because he faults its editorial choices over a Harris interview on “60 Minutes” that he declined to sit for. Trump’s allies, meanwhile, raised concerns about how a new administration might deal with big business bythreatening to cancel Deloitte’s federal contractsafter an employee apparently leaked Sen. JD Vance’s private messages critical of the former president.And new details are emerging of the former president’s genuflection to foreign tyrants like Vladimir Putin after the Kremlin confirmedTrump sent Covid-19 teststo a Russian authoritarian who is a sworn enemy of the United States during a pandemic he frequently downplayed.History suggests that Trump doesn’t always act on everything he says. But his past behavior suggests his threats should be taken seriously.And a Supreme Courtruling granting presidentssubstantial immunity suggests few impediments to imperial executive power.Former President Barack Obama speaks at a campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris at the University of Pittsburgh on October 10, 2024.Jeff Swensen/Getty ImagesRelated articleObama’s reemergence on the campaign trail for Harris comes as he recognizes his own legacy is at stakeTrump’s deepening extremism is increasing already massive pressure on Harris. And a phalanx of senior Democratic leaders — including former Presidents Bill Clinton andBarack Obama— are pleading with voters in swing states, especially the Black and Latino voters Harris needs, not to let Trump return.The vice president sharpened her attacks on Trump on Sunday during a rally in North Carolina, criticizing him for failing to release his medical records (just afterissuing her own medical report) and for refusing to meet her in a second debate and to be interviewed by “60 Minutes.”“He’s not being transparent with the voters. … It makes you wonder, why does his staff want him to hide away? One must question, are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable?” she asked.Supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris listen to her speak during a rally at Ripon College, in Wisconsin, on October 3.Jim Vondruska/Getty ImagesGrowing fears among DemocratsDread is growing among Democrats that the euphoria over Harris’ entry into the race in July, her successful convention in August and her debate performance the following month have not translated yet into a decisive lead over Trump.There’s no clear leader in the latest CNN average of national polls, which includes neck-and-neck surveys by CBS, ABC and NBC released Sunday. Even if Harris were leading in national surveys, there are fears that, like Hillary Clinton before her, she could win the popular vote but fall short in the Electoral College.The tightly balanced race three weeks out shows that while he’s an aberration from traditional presidential candidates, Trump is offering something millions of Americans want. Republicans argue that Harris-Biden policies caused a spike in inflation the White House tried for months to downplay. Trump cites the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan to argue the current White House is seen as weak around the world. And after failing to tackle the policy or political ramifications of immigration earlier in Biden’s term, Democrats offered Trump a huge opening on a critical issue.Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris walks to board Air Force Two as she departs for New York, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on October 7, 2024.Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersRelated articleDemocrats grow anxious as Election Day nearsThe close contestalso suggests that despite Trump’s unapologetic extremism, Democrats have failed for the third election in a row to produce a candidate and a message that can give them any reassurance about the election result. While liberals and moderates might be horrified by the strongman leadership Trump proposes, he’s winning on what voters consistently say is the top election issue: the economy. In the ABC News/Ipsos poll, for example, 59% say it’s getting worse, even though the job market is robust, inflation is far from its highs and interest rates are easing.With the nation in such a sour mood, Harris’ incumbency as vice president is a liability. And her failure,in a recent interviewwith ABC’s “The View,” to come up with even one thing she would have done differently from Biden is a misstep Trump will exploit all the way to Election Day. Harris has spelled out policies to help people buy and rent homes, to ease the cost of health care and to revive a bipartisan border bill that Trump killed. But it’s still often hard in her interviews to spot a powerful rationale for her campaign. Trump’s vow to deport migrants, torch US trade competitors with tariffs and fix a world spinning out of control looks forceful by comparison, even if extreme.Video Ad Feedback'Bad news for Democrats': Data reporter shows where GOP is making big gains04:29- Source:CNNStill, Democrats looking for reassurance might note that Trump tops out at 48% or below in most polls. This implies that his typical ceiling in national elections remains in place, while Harris may still have room to grow. In the NBC News poll, 10% of voters said they might change their minds. And what the network called a “sliver” were still unclaimed. In states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and Georgia, even late shifts in support could be decisive.The eventual makeup of the electorate will also be crucial. Will Harris’ focus on abortion rights, for instance, stir higher-than-expected turnout from women voters that could confound pollsters’ assumptions? Can she stem her opponent’s advances among Black male and Hispanic voters? Or will Trump tap a new pool of support among Americans who agree with him on many issues but rarely vote?What Harris needs to doVice President Kamala Harris speaks to the press before boarding Air Force Two at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on October 12, 2024.Brendan Smialowski/Pool/AFP/Getty ImagesDemocratic strategist Doug Sosnik believes the election is a 50-50 race and that Harris plateaued in the last 10 days as Trump gained some ground. He told CNN Political Director David Chalian on the“CNN Political Briefing”podcast that the presidency may depend on which candidate finally brands themself as a change agent.Trump’s campaign released a memo Sunday claiming that question had already been answered. “She can’t convince the voters that she is ‘the change agent’ in the race, that she will be better on the economy, inflation, immigration, crime, or improving people’s financial situation,” the memo said. “The bottom line is that voters say President Trump will do a better job.”But Sosnik said the campaign is “really going to boil down to Harris and whether she can stand up to the pressure and the scrutiny and whether she can create a permission structure for people who don’t want to vote for Trump but are concerned about Harris.” He warned: “They don’t feel like she has given them enough reason to vote for her … she is not doing that right now.”Harris’ task is complicated by the lack of opportunities to take on Trump directly. The former president, who has spent weeks lambasting her for avoiding the press, rarely strays from his comfort zone of conservative media and Fox News, where he enjoys adulation rather than cross-examination. He is dodging a second presidential debate against Harris and pulled out of a “60 Minutes” interview before critiquing the vice president’s performance on the show. And whereas in 2016, when Trump’s rallies were hard to escape on cable television, the performances now rarely get end-to-end coverage outside conservative media, meaning that many voters may not appreciate his extreme and increasingly disjointed antics.Obama seemed baffled during a campaign appearance for Harris in Pennsylvania last week at his predecessor’s enduring appeal among millions of voters. “There is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anyone but himself,” Obama said. “Donald Trump sees power as nothing more than a means to an end.”But Trump — despite his two impeachments, his criminal conviction, and his attempt to destroy democracy to stay in power — is within reach of the presidency again with a more radical agenda than before.Sen. Chris Murphy has been sounding the alarm in recent days with a string of increasingly frantic posts on X. Reacting to Trump’s description of undocumented migrants last week as “rapists” and the “worst criminals in the world,” Murphy wrote that such rhetoric portends “a dystopian country” with open-air prison camps and the rule of law suspended. “We cannot let this happen. His vision of America is not America,” the Connecticut Democrat added.His post underscored what Harris represents for those who fear the very real prospect of Trump’s return.","Score: -1

cnn,How hurricane season is affecting the way Americans follow the Trump-Harris race,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/breakthrough-polling-projects-hurricanes-trump-harris/index.html,"CNN—With the election less than a month away, the public’s attention has shifted to the candidates’ responses to hurricane season,according to The Breakthrough, a CNN polling project that tracks what average Americans are actually hearing, reading and seeing about the presidential nominees throughout the campaign. FormerPresident Donald Trump’s campaign also faced renewed focus on his legal troubles in the wake of a new filing by federal prosecutors, the survey finds.In the wake ofHurricane Helene, which has killed more than 230 people across the southeastern United States, “hurricane” was the word most frequently mentioned when respondents were asked what they’d heard about Trump. It was the second-most frequent word mentioned when they were asked about Vice President Kamala Harris, second only to “campaign.” The poll, conducted by SSRS and Verasight on behalf of a research team from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, was fielded from October 4-7, beforeHurricane Miltonmade landfall in Florida on Wednesday night.Democrats and Republicans were about equally likely to mention the hurricane when talking about Harris – although their perspectives on her response often differed sharply.Harris “was working with FEMA on providing assistance and recovery for the areas affected by Hurricane Helene,” one Democratic respondent wrote, while another credited her with having done “a great job of consoling hurricane victims in Georgia.”By contrast, a Republican respondent wrote about hearing that Harris “is only paying $750 to those whose homes are being devastated in the hurricanes, yet sending billions upon billions of dollars to Ukraine and Israel.” The $750 is an apparent reference to a payment program at the Federal Emergency Management Agencythat has been mischaracterized by Trump and othersas the only assistance FEMA is providing.Republicans were far likelier than Democrats to mention the hurricane in conjunction with Trump. When Democrats were asked what they’d recently heard about the GOP presidential nominee, they were more likely than Republicans to mention his response to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, or simply use the word “lie.”In the latest set of data, Americans also mentioned the October 5 rally Trump held in Butler, Pennsylvania – the site of the first assassination attempt against him this summer. And they referenced two other names in conjunction with him: Elon Musk, whoappeared onstage with Trump in Butler, and Jack Smith, the special counsel whoserecently unsealed legal brieflaid out the government’s sweeping case against the former president for his effort to overturn the 2020 election.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgRoughly 14% of respondents who’d heard something about Trump referenced words related to his legal issues, up from 7% in the previous wave of data and the highest share to do so since early September, when the sentencing in his New York criminal case was delayed until after the 2024 election.Asked about Harris, 8% of respondents who’d heard something about her mentioned words relating to endorsements – in this case, largely a reference to Republican former Vice President Dick Cheney, who announced his support of her last month, and his daughter Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman whorecently appeared with Harrison the campaign trail. Harris also previously saw bursts of attention after endorsements from Oprah Winfrey and Taylor Swift.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgThe sentiment behind the words Americans used to describe what they’d heard about Harris remained modestly more positive than the words they used to describe the news about Trump. This doesn’t mean that they expressed warmer feelings about Harris personally but that what they said about her tended to be framed in relatively positive terms and tone. The tone of responses relating to both candidates were overall more negative than positive.","Score: 0

cnn,Harris’ border visit and economy speech capture attention as warning signs emerge for campaign,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/06/politics/breakthrough-polling-project-harris-lie/index.html,"CNN—Kamala Harris’visit to the borderandspeechoutlining her economic vision captured the attention of a sizable share of Americans as September came to a close, according to new findings fromThe Breakthrough, a polling project that tracks how the public is following election news. But some emerging trends in the data hint at warning signs for the vice president’s campaign.The share of Americans hearing anything at all about Harris has dropped each week since her presidential debate with former PresidentDonald Trumpin early September, and during that same time, the tone Americans use in describing what they’ve heard about her has grown more negative, reaching the lowest point of her campaign in the latest results.Looking at what people say they have heard, read or seen about Harris, “lie” has emerged as a persistent top word that some Americans associate with her. In the latest data, it was the fourth-most mentioned word after “border,” “polls” and “campaign.” It ranked sixth in the previous week’s data and second the week of theABC News presidential debate, after ranking no higher than 12th in earlier rounds of the survey and no higher than 20th prior to the Democratic convention in August.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgThe survey, conducted September 27-30 by SSRS and Verasight for research teams from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, measures what Americans say they have recently heard, read or seen about Harris and Trump.The share of Americans mentioning words such as “lie” or “liar” when asked what they’ve heard about Harris remains quite small — just 6% in the latest data, compared with 15% who mentioned something related to immigration, for example — but it has grown over time, rising from 3% or less prior to the Democratic convention to peak at 9% shortly after the debate.“Kamala says nothing,” wrote one respondent included in the latest survey. “She uses a bunch of words that make no sense. She says she will close the border, but that is a lie to get elected. Everything she promises are lies.”Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a rally at the Dort Financial Center in Flint, Mich., Friday, Oct. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)Mark Schiefelbein/APRelated articleHarris tries to turn the tables on Trump by embracing the border as a key issueThe broader focus on immigration (mentioned by 15% in relation to Harris) and the economy (mentioned by 13%) in the latest data marks a notable shift in responses about Harris, following her campaign’s efforts to focus attention on the two topics with a visit to the southern border in Arizona and an economic policy speech in Pittsburgh. It marks the first time in the survey that multiple policy-related topics have landed in the top five for Harris, and the most recent data saw by far the most mentions for immigration-related words in relation to her campaign since she entered the race in late July.“I have watched her speeches and appreciated her articulate explanation of her policies and positions on various things,” another respondent wrote. “Her concern for all and ability to concretely point to solutions to problems is a sharp contrast to Donald Trump.”On Trump’s side, theassassination attemptsagainst him remain prominent in the public’s attention, while immigration has faded a bit andhis meeting last monthwith Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky garnered attention.“He met with Zelensky and was not very enthusiastic about helping Ukraine,” one respondent wrote.Responses calling the former president a liar are also persistently near the top of his list. About 8% in the latest data use the word “lie” or “liar” in relation to Trump. That figure has frequently been in the high single digits as a share of topics about Trump since the start of the survey in June, dipping below that at times, including around the first assassination attempt against the former president and the Republican National Convention.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgAlthough responses about Harris are generally still less negative in tone than those about Trump, there has been a notable decline in overall sentiment in the Harris responses, while Trump’s numbers have rebounded slightly following a post-debate drop. For Harris, the negative shift is apparent across parties, with sentiments expressed by Democrats, Republicans and independents all tilting slightly more negative in the new data than in the week prior. For Trump, though, sentiment has held steady among Republicans, while shifting slightly less negative than the previous survey among independents and Democrats.The latest poll found that just under two-thirds of Americans (64%) reported seeing, reading or hearing something about Harris, compared with 68% who said the same about Trump. It marks the fourth straight week in which more people reported hearing about Trump than they did about Harris, and it’s a notable drop from the previous week in the shares saying they’d heard about each candidate (Trump down 7 points, Harris down 5).The overall level of attention to the presidential candidates now is lower than it was at this point in previous cycles, though that may be a side effect of debate timing. In 2020, for example, more than 8 in 10 Americans reported having heard news about Trump and Joe Biden in the same week of that campaign, but there was a presidential debate held on September 29. In 2016, there was a mid-September dip in attention ahead of that year’s first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton, held on September 26.“It has been relatively quiet this week,” one respondent to the latest survey wrote when asked about Trump. “I haven’t heard of anything.”CNN’s Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report.","Score: 0

cnn,CNN Instant Poll: No clear winner in VP debate between Tim Walz and JD Vance,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/politics/election-poll-walz-vance-debate/index.html,"CNN—Registered voters who watchedTuesday’s debate between vice presidential nomineesTim Walz and JD Vance were closely divided over which candidate did the better job, according to aCNN instant poll of debate watchers conducted by SSRS, and the event left viewers with more positive views of both candidates than they held pre-debate.Among debate watchers, Walz remains the candidate who’s seen more positively and as more in touch with their needs and vision for the country. Vance, who suffers from more of an image deficit among both viewers and the public at large, boosted his standing among the debate audience, outperforming expectations and gaining ground on the share who perceive him as qualified. He was also narrowly seen as doing a better job than Walz of defending his running mate. Both men, the poll finds, are viewed by a majority of debate watchers as qualified to assume the presidency if needed. And practically none of the voters who tuned in saw the debate as a reason to change their votes.Viewers in the spin room watch the CBS News vice presidential debate on October 1 in New York.Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APRelated article36 key lines to explain the Vance-Walz vice presidential debateFollowing the debate, 51% of viewers said that Vance did the better job, with 49% picking Walz. In a survey conducted of the same voters prior to the debate, Walz held the advantage as the candidate they expected to perform more strongly, 54% to 45%.The closely divided opinions about the outcome of Tuesday’s debate stand in sharp contrast to the more decisive audience reaction following this year’s top-of-the-ticket debates. In June,two-thirds of debate watchersthought that formerPresident Donald TrumpoutperformedPresident Joe Biden, while a 63% majority who tuned in to the September debate between Trump andKamala Harrissaid thatthe vice president did the better job.Views of the vice presidential hopefuls split largely along pre-established political lines Tuesday night: 90% of debate watchers who support Trump’s candidacy said that Vance did the better job, while a slightly narrower 82% of the Harris supporters who tuned in saw Walz as the winner.The poll’s results reflect opinions of the debate only among those voters who tuned in and aren’t representative of the views of the full voting public. Debate watchers in the poll were 3 percentage points likelier to be Democratic-aligned than Republican-aligned, making for an audience that was about 5 points more Democratic-leaning than all registered voters nationally. That’s a difference from the audience for the two presidential debates this year, both of which were slightly more GOP-leaning than the potential American electorate overall. What voters who don’t tune in hear about an event in the following days can often be as impactful as immediate views of the event itself.Following the debate, 59% of debate watchers said they had a favorable view of Walz, with just 22% viewing him unfavorably – an improvement from his already positive numbers among the same voters pre-debate (46% favorable, 32% unfavorable). Debate watchers came away from the debate with roughly neutral views of Vance: 41% rated him favorably and 44% unfavorably. That’s also an improvement from their image of Vance pre-debate, when his ratings among this group were deeply underwater (30% favorable, 52% unfavorable).Among debate watchers, Walz boosted his favorability far more among women than men, while Vance’s gains were about the same among voters of both genders. About 1 in 5 Trump supporters (21%) who tuned in now say they have a favorable view of Walz, while Vance’s favorability rating with Harris’ supporters remains at just 8%.Ina CNN poll of all Americans taken prior to the debate, views of Walz were narrowly above water, with 36% of voters viewing him favorably, 32% unfavorably, and a sizable 33% saying they hadn’t heard of him or had no opinion of him. By contrast, views of Vance tilted negative, with 30% of registered voters rating him favorably, 42% unfavorably, and 27% offering no opinion.A 65% majority of debate watchers now say Walz is qualified to serve as president if necessary, with 58% saying the same of Vance. Prior to the debate, 62% of the same voters thought Walz was qualified to assume the presidency if needed and 50% that Vance was qualified to do so.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance attend a debate hosted by CBS News in New York on Tuesday.Mike Segar/ReutersRelated articleFact-checking the CBS News vice presidential debate between Vance and WalzDebate watchers said, 48% to 35%, that Walz is more in touch than Vance with the needs and problems of people like them, and by a similar margin, 48% to 39%, that Walz, rather than Vance, more closely shares their vision for America. The share of viewers who said that both vice presidential hopefuls are in touch with their problems is twice as large as the share who said that neither is, 12% to 6% – a level of positivity unusual in this year’s election cycle.There’s a significant gender gap among viewers over which candidate more closely shares their vision for America: Among female voters, Walz has the clear advantage, with half saying he does compared with the 36% who see Vance’s vision as closer to theirs. Male voters split more evenly, 47% Walz to 43% Vance.Viewers said by a narrow margin, 37% to 33%, that Vance did a better job than Walz in defending his running mate, with 27% saying that each candidate did an equally good job, and 3% that neither did. Seven in 10 Trump supporters said Vance did the better job defending his running mate, while 57% of Harris backers said Walz did best on that.A negligible 1% of voters who tuned into the debate said it had changed their mind about whom to vote for, with Harris and Trump supporters equally unlikely to view the event as decisive.The CNN poll was conducted by text message with 574 registered US voters who said they watched the debate Tuesday, and the poll findings are representative of the views of debate watchers only.

That’s a shift from late August and early September, when roughly equal shares recalled hearing news about each of the candidates.Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to mention the word “assassination” and other phrases surrounding the attempt on Trump’s life, such as references to the golf course where the attempt took place.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.org“Donald Trump has been out on the campaign trail and it’s getting dangerous for him. He had a second attempt on his life recently at a golf course,” one respondent wrote.Democrats were more likely to still focus on theSeptember presidential debate, bringing up words like “lie” and references to Trump falsely claiming that migrants in Ohio were eating pets. “He continues to peddle the Springfield story about Haitian immigrants eating local pets,” wrote another respondent. “He is using anti-Semitic tropes in his speeches. He continues to spread mistruths about his performance in the debate.”Political independents mentioned both sets of topics, the survey found, and Americans across the aisle were about equally likely to mention words pointing more broadly to the presidential race, such as “campaign” or “election.”Some of the disparity between Democrats and Republicans may stem from a difference in the media sources consumed. But it may also reflect differences in the news stories that resonate more with each group — as well the way partisans on each side are likely to describe those stories when asked, which often reflects their own political sentiments.Asked what they’d seen, read or heard about Harris, meanwhile, Americans’ responses included the word “debate” — a reference both to her performance in her first presidential debate and her stated willingness for a rematch against Trump — as well asher interview with Oprah Winfrey.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgThe sentiment behind the words Americans used to describe what they’d heard about Harris remained more positive than the words they used to describe the news about Trump.

Trump faces limited paths to victory should he fail to hold North Carolina – the state where he earned his slimmest margin of victory in 2020 – and a win inNebraska’s 2nd Districtwould open up a path for Harris through the northern “blue wall” states even if she fails to carry any of the Sun Belt battlegrounds.In North Carolina, Harris and Trump stand at 48% each among likely voters. In Nebraska’s 2nd District, theso-called blue dotencompassing Omaha, Harris has 53% to Trump’s 42%, the poll finds.North Carolina, which narrowly supported Barack Obama in 2008 and has gone red in the past three presidential elections, is a state Democrats hope to make competitive again this year.

More than 7 in 10 among both Harris and Trump backers say their choice is a mark of support for their chosen candidate, not just a vote against their opponent. But 12% of likely voters in the state say they could still change their minds about the candidate they’re supporting – more than enough to make a difference in a deadlocked race.Trump currently leads Harris among White likely voters in North Carolina, 58% to 39%, a narrower margin than his edge over Biden among White voters who turned out in the 2020 election,according to CNN exit polls. White likely voters with college degrees currently favor Harris over Trump by a wide margin, which would mark a shift from a narrow divide among this group four years ago.Harris leads Trump, 79% to 11%, among Black likely voters, a group that in 2020 made up roughly one-quarter of the state’s electorate. While Harris’ standing among Black likely voters in the poll is currently weaker than the share Biden ended up winning in 2020, that does not reflect significantly increased support for Trump – rather, about one-tenth of Black likely voters currently say they’re supporting a third-party candidate or are unsure of their choice.Trump addresses supporters at a campaign rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, on September 21, 2024.Brian Snyder/ReutersMale voters in North Carolina break narrowly toward Trump (51% to 45%) with Harris holding a slight advantage among female voters (50% to 46%), but the gender gap is smaller than that seen in CNN’s most recent national survey.Photo Illustration by CNNRelated article‘I’m a black NAZI!’: NC GOP nominee for governor made dozens of disturbing comments on porn forumDown ballot, Harris is significantly outperformed by DemocratJosh Stein, who leads Robinson, the lieutenant governor, 53% to 36%, among likely voters in the North Carolina governor’s race.Robinson, who has faced a wave of scandal after CNN uncovered inflammatory comments he madeon a porn website, is viewed unfavorably by a majority of the state’s likely voters (27% view him favorably, 53% unfavorably, 20% have no opinion).

They’re evenly split on whether Harris or Trump more closely shares their view on what the country’s biggest problems are, and closely divided on which candidate would bring needed change (44% Trump, 42% Harris) or has clear policy plans to solve the country’s problems (42% Trump, 39% Harris).A view of voting booths at a polling station for the New York U.S. Presidential Primary election in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, U.S., April 2, 2024.

Fewer see Harris’ policies as dangerously extreme (35%).Trump holds an 8-point advantage over Harris on trust to handle the economy among North Carolina’s likely voters, who also side with him on issues relating to crime and safety (by 7 percentage points) and immigration (by 11 points), but give Harris the edge on protecting democracy (by 4 points) and on handling abortion and reproductive rights (by 11 points). As in other battleground states, the economy is cited as the top issue in the presidential race by a plurality of voters.In Nebraska’s 2nd District, Trump sees more erosion on the issues on which he’s traditionally posted his strongest numbers: likely voters there are closely split between him and Harris on both the economy and immigration, and give Harris the lead on handling crime and safety (by 6 points), democracy (by 14 points) and abortion and reproductive rights (by 21 points).Nearly six in 10 likely voters in the district call Trump too extreme (57%), and about half (51%) say he’s extreme enough to pose a threat.

But just 41% in North Carolina say they’re very confident, rising to a 59% majority in Nebraska’s 2nd District.The Nebraska seat also sees a far smaller partisan divide in election confidence: while Harris supporters there are 33 points more likely than Trump supporters to express high confidence in their state’s election system, that expands to a 52-point gap between each candidate’s supporters in North Carolina.Interviews were conducted September 20-25, 2024, online and by telephone with registered voters, including 931 voters in North Carolina and 749 in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.

cnn,"Harris still lags behind Biden’s 2020 margins among Black voters, but latest CNN poll suggests she has room to grow support",https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/26/politics/black-voters-poll-harris-trump/index.html,"CNN—KamalaHarris leadsDonald Trumpby a wide margin among Black likely voters, according to anew CNN poll conducted by SSRS, but still falls short ofJoe Biden’s winning 2020 margins with this group. Yet the poll suggests that Black likely voters currently supporting Trump or third-party candidates are not as locked into their choices as those Black likely voters who back the vice president.CNN’s latest poll finds Harris leading Trump by 63 points among Black likely voters, 79% to 16%. That’s a considerable improvement over Biden’s 46-point advantage over Trump among registered voters in CNN’s June poll, which was its last with the president at the top of the ticket. But that advantage falls short of the Biden-Harris campaign’s 75-point margin among Black voters, according toexit polls from 2020.Since Harris’ entrance into the race, enthusiasm among Black voters about the election appears to have grown. In the latest poll, 79% of Black registered voters say they would definitely vote, up from 68% in the June poll. For voters overall, that stood at 82% in the latest poll, about the same as in June. Black voters now are just as likely as other voters to say it is extremely important that they, personally, vote (both at 63%), while in June, Black registered voters were less likely to say the same (57% among Black voters, 66% overall).Harris’ improvement over Biden’s margins from earlier this year comes as the poll finds broad support for her from the 40% of Black likely voters who view Biden’s presidency as a failure – Harris leads Trump 65% to 31% among these voters.The poll suggests Trump’s improvements among Black voters relative to 2020 are driven largely by Black voters under the age of 60. Harris leads among Black voters aged 60 and over by 87 points, almost identical to Biden’s 85-point margin in 2020, according to exit polls for the same group. This shrinks to a 55-point lead for Harris among Black voters younger than 60 (Biden won this group by 71 points in 2020, according to exit polls). Trump performs best among Black likely voters younger than 40, with 22% support.President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign rally at Girard College on May 29, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/FileStill, CNN’s poll suggests that Harris has the potential to improve her margins. Her supporters are broadly locked in and unlikely to shift in the race – 92% of Black likely voters who support Harris say their minds are already made up. But among those backing other candidates, a third say they may yet change their mind.Harris is also generally viewed more favorably among Black registered voters compared with registered voters overall, even after accounting for Black voters’ overwhelming Democratic lean. Nearly 8 in 10 Black voters view Harris favorably, and Black Democrats view Harris slightly more positively than others in the party, while Black voters outside the Democratic Party offer far more positive views of her than do independents or Republicans of other races.Black voters who don’t consider themselves Democrats are more likely than non-Democrats of other racial backgrounds to say that Harris has improved their view of the Democratic Party; that they would be proud or excited if she wins the election; and that her views are generally mainstream, with Black Democratic voters offering similar or modestly more positive views than others in their party. Among non-Democrats, Black voters also rate Harris as more aligned with their vision of a president than do other voters across all the attributes tested in the poll, including temperament, ability to understand the problems of people like themselves and leadership skills.That carries over to views of Trump too. Non-Democratic Black voters are more likely to view Trump’s presidency as a failure than other voters who share their partisan perspective and are less likely to trust Trump over Harris on handling each of the issues tested in the poll, including the economy and immigration.While Black likely voters are largely focused on the same issues as the broader electorate, the CNN polling does find some differences among Democrats. Black likely voters are just as likely as all other groups to consider the economy their top issue (41%). Democratic Black likely voters, however, are twice as likely as Democratic likely voters overall to consider the economy their top issue (42%, compared with 19%). Democratic Black likely voters are also less apt than Democratic likely voters overall to say that protecting democracy or abortion and reproductive rights are their top issue.When asked which economic issue is most important to them, Black voters across the political spectrum are generally aligned with the overall electorate and put inflation at the top of the list. But Black likely voters are more likely than other voters to name jobs and wages as the top economic issue and less likely to say federal spending.Nearly 9 in 10 Black registered voters say the political system in the United States is in need of a major overhaul or major reforms, and a large majority (85%) say that the federal government does not do enough for Black Americans. Roughly half of Black voters (47%) say that the federal government does both too much for White Americans and too little for Black Americans. Still, Black registered voters are more likely than the broader electorate to say that they are satisfied with the influence people like themselves have on the political process (52%, compared with 38% overall).The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS online and by telephone September 19-22, 2024, among 2,074 registered voters nationwide drawn from a probability-based panel. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election. The survey included an oversample of Black registered voters to reach a total of 579; this group has been weighted to its proper size within the population for all survey results. Results for the full sample of registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.0 percentage points; it is the same among likely voters and larger for subgroups. Results among Black registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 7.8 percentage points; among Black likely voters, it is plus or minus 7.7 percentage points.CNN’s Jennifer Agiesta and Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report.","Score: -1

cnn,Trump wants to renegotiate his own trade deal with Mexico and Canada,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/usmca-trump-renegotiate/index.html,"WashingtonCNN—Former President Donald Trump is once again pledging to save American manufacturing and bring back jobs by rewriting a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.But this time, instead of replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as NAFTA, which he has often described as the “worst trade deal ever made,” he wants to renegotiate his own trade deal.Trump signed onto theUS-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, in 2018. It took effect in January 2020 and replaced NAFTA.In 2018, Trumpsaidthe USMCA would be “the most modern, up-to-date, and balanced trade agreement in the history of our country, with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed.”But now, he thinks it can be improved.“Upon taking office, I will formally notify Mexico and Canada of my intention to invoke the six-year renegotiation provision of the USMCA that I put in,” Trump said last week during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.The USMCA includes a clause that requires a review by the three signatory countries at the six-year anniversary.When asked by Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo in an interview that aired Sunday about his plan to renegotiate the USMCA, Trump said it would not undermine the deal he put together.“I want to make it a much better deal. I want to take advantage, now, of the car industry,” he said.Harris also wants to review the USMCAVice President Kamala Harris has also said she would use the USMCA review process.Harris, who is now the Democratic presidential nominee, was one of 10 US senators who voted against USMCA at the time.“I knew it was not sufficient to protect our country and its workers,” she said in a statement last week.Following the Senate vote in 2020, Harrissaidshe was concerned the USMCA’s environmental provisions did not go far enough to address climate change.Here’s what’s in the USMCAMuch of USMCAsimply updated the 25-year-old NAFTA.One of the biggest changes was a new incentive to build cars and trucks in North America. USMCA requires 75% of a vehicle’s parts to be made in one of the three countries – up from the previous 62.5% rule – in order to remain free from tariffs when moving across borders.It also required more vehicle parts to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour.The trade deal created sweeping new benefits for the technology sector, in a chapter on digital trade that wasn’t part of the original NAFTA.Strong labor rules and environmental protections were also included.","Score: 0

cnn,Trump campaign tries to push immigration issue over Bill Clinton’s comments on Laken Riley,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/bill-clinton-laken-riley-campaign/index.html,"CNN—Former President Donald Trump’s campaign is highlighting former President Bill Clinton’s comment Sunday that Georgia nursing student Laken Riley’s death “probably wouldn’t have happened” if migrants, including her alleged killer, had “all been properly vetted.”Clinton’s remark came as he lambasted Trump for scuttling a bipartisan border security bill earlier this year. The bill sputtered in January when Trump’s opposition to it led Republican support to erode. Vice President Kamala Harris, who islooking to blunt Trump’s attacks on immigration, has vowed to revive that bill and sign it into law if she wins the White House.Clinton said the bill would have led to “total vetting before people got in” at the US-Mexico border.“Now, Trump killed the bill,” he said.He then pointed to Riley, a 22-year-old Augusta University nursing student who was killed while jogging in February. The suspect,Jose Antonio Ibarra, an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela, was arrested in 2022 after entering the United States illegally, according to a statement from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but was released for further processing.“You got a case in Georgia not very long ago – didn’t you, they made an ad about it – a young woman who had been killed by an immigrant. Yeah, well, if they’d all been properly vetted that probably wouldn’t have happened,” Clinton said. “But if they are all properly vetted, that doesn’t happen, and America is not having enough babies to keep our population up, so we need immigrants that have been vetted to do work.”But Trump’s campaign cast Clinton’s comments as an indictment of President Joe Biden and Harris’ handling of border security, noting that Riley’s alleged killer had entered the United States in 2022, long before that bill had been drafted.“Kamala Harris claimed the border was ‘secure’ just days after Laken Riley’s illegal immigrant killer Jose Ibarra crossed into the nation. Ibarra was caught at the border and then released into the country by Kamala Harris,” Trump’s campaign said in a statement. “President Trump will secure the border and stop catch-and-release. This is why he was just endorsed by the Border Patrol Union.”The Trump War Roomaccount on X posteda video of Clinton’s remarks on Monday, which the Harris campaign said was “deceptively edited.”“Clinton said Trump killed a bipartisan border security bill that VP Harris supported which would strengthen vetting for people entering the country,” said Ian Sams, a spokesman for the campaign,in a separate post on X.The back-and-forth demonstrated how Democrats have tried to address what polls have shown is among Trump’s most potent issues – and how the former president has pushed back, accusing Biden and Harris of taking action far too late and only as the presidential election loomed.Riley’s killing and the suspect’s immigration status renewed debate on the country’s immigration policies at the highest level. Biden held up a pin with Riley’s name on it atthe State of the Union addressin March.Ibarra was indicted in May on charges of murder and aggravated assault with intent to rape, as well as for an earlier incident in which he allegedly peeped into the window of a student. He has pleaded not guilty in the case.","Score: 1

According to the campaign, the loans would be provided through a new partnership between the Small Business Administration and some lenders and banks.Harris is also calling for creating and investing in programs that help expand pathways for job opportunities for Black men, including promoting apprenticeships, strengthening the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and investing in more Black male teachers. On the campaign trail, Harris has said she will cut college degree requirements for certain federal jobs if elected president.The plan will also support a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets and a National Health Equity Initiativethat focuses on addressing health challenges that disproportionately impact Black men.

The vice president has often reiterated that she believes marijuana should legalized in the US.The campaign will tout the agenda during several upcoming events, including “Black Men Huddle Up” events, an Economic Freedom Talk series and paid media outreach as they try to draw a contrast with former President Donald Trump.“Donald Trump’s outreach is gold sneakers, T shirts of mug shots and insults and putting other communities down.

cnn,The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/politics/senate-race-rankings-october-2024/index.html,"CNN—With just over a month until Election Day, the same competitive races continue to dominate the Senate landscape, but there are a few significant changes to the order of CNN’s ranking of the seats most likely to flip.And in the final weeks, the degree to which these 10 races – which are mostly playing out in statesDonald Trumpeither won or narrowly lost in 2020 – move in the same direction as the presidential contest will likely determine which party wins control of the Senate.Republican Senate candidate for Montana Tim Sheehy walks up to the stage during a rally for Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump at the Brick Breeden Fieldhouse at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana, on August 9, 2024.Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images/FileRelated articleHow the Senate GOP’s potential majority maker is staying ‘shielded’ in push to oust Tester in MontanaRepublicans – who are virtually a lock to pick up the West Virginia seat and would need to either win the White House or pick up one more seat for the majority – have an incentive to nationalize many of their targeted races. Well-funded Democratic incumbents, for the most part, are touting statewide and local accomplishments and their support for abortion rights.Two states that are part of the Democratic “blue wall” – and also key White House battlegrounds – move up on this month’s rankings, which are based on reporting, as well as fundraising, polling and advertising data. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are now in the middle of the pack of flippable seats, along with Michigan, which remains at No. 4.The oddity of this year’s fight for the Senate is that Democrats have consistently led in the public polling of key races, but it’s Republicans who are poised to gain seats and, potentially, control of the chamber.That’s a reflection of the Senate map – but also increasingly some post-Labor Day tightening as GOP spending picks up and voters get to know their candidates. Still, no public general election polling that meets CNN standards has shown the Republican nominee ahead in any of the seats that Democrats are defending, save for West Virginia.And two GOP targets – Arizona and Nevada – are moving down the list because Republicans have not kept the races as competitive as elsewhere.Earlier this year, those two states were Nos. 4 and 5. Now, they’re at 7 and 8.Florida Sen. Rick Scott, left, and Texas Sen.

DSCC Chairman Gary Peters has insisted that this is extra spending that won’t take money away from their defensive priorities. Texas remains at No. 9 on CNN’s ranking, while Florida fell off the list earlier this year in favor of the race in deep-blue Maryland.Nebraska is a new state generating political buzz, but it hasn’t earned a place on the ranking. Still, independent Dan Osborn’s challenge to GOP Sen. Deb Fischer has prompted the National Republican Senatorial Committee to start spending here, and elections analysts have moved the race out of the solid Republican category.There remain lots of unknowns in Nebraska, but we’ll be watching to see how that race – and the 10 others – develop over the next month.1. West VirginiaSen. Joe ManchinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/FileWest Virginia is essentially out of reach for Democrats, who had little chance of holding this seat without Sen. Joe Manchin running for reelection. Manchin, now an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is likely to be succeeded by Republican Jim Justice, the state’s two-term governor.Justice has had his share of negative headlines, but in a state poised to back Trump by a significant margin, it’s hard to see a world in which Republicans don’t pick up this open seat.2. MontanaSen. Jon TesterAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileDemocrat Jon Tester, who’s running for a fourth term in a state Trump has twice carried by double digits, remains the most vulnerable Senate incumbent this year. Republicans feel confident their nominee,Tim Sheehy, has an edge – and both Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales and the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter have shifted their rating of the once toss-up race toward the GOP.Democrats still see a path to victory for Tester, who has a proven history of defying the partisan lean of his state by communicating both what he’s done for Montanans and painting a contrast with his opponents.Democrats are trying that playbook against Sheehy, trying to define the wealthy businessman and retired Navy SEAL, who moved to Montana in 2014, as an out-of-state carpetbagger who cannot be trusted. Recentlyunearthed audio recordingsof Sheehy using racist stereotypes to refer to Native Americans has played into that message, with Democrats arguing that he’s alienating a crucial demographic in the state. In a debate earlier this week, Sheehy acknowledged his comments were “insensitive,” saying, “I come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color sometimes.”Tester’s campaign is now leaning into abortion rights on the airwaves – an issue that’s on the ballot in Montana this year. Arecent adfeatures a self-described “life-long” Republican woman arguing that Sheehy “wants to take away personal freedoms.”But Republicans are invoking transgender issues in an attempt to cast Tester as a liberal who’s been changed by his years in Washington, while Sheehy istrying to tie Tester to KamalaHarris– especially on immigration. Tester – who has not endorsed in the presidential race – tried to meet those attacks during their debate by pointing out that Sheehy would not have supported this year’s bipartisan border bill that Republicans blocked.3. OhioSen. Sherrod BrownBonnie Cash/Getty Images/FileDemocratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing his toughest reelection in a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 points. Public polling still shows the three-term senator ahead of GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, although that is expected to tighten as more Republican voters come home to Moreno. Brown was at 47% to Moreno’s 43% in a late SeptemberNew York Times/Siena College pollamong likely Ohio voters – not far outside the margin of error. But the reassuring news for Democrats: Brown was winning 10% of Trump voters.Democrats have seized on Moreno’s recent comments at a town hall suggesting that some suburban women were single-issue voters when it comes to abortion and questioning why women over 50 would care about the topic. Brown pointed to the remarks as evidence that his opponent is out of step with the 57% of Ohio voters who last year approved a ballot measure protecting reproductive rights. WinSenate, a Democratic outside group, also launcheda new adwith a woman talking about the emergency abortion she underwent at 25 for an ectopic pregnancy, saying, “Our lives don’t belong in Bernie Moreno’s hands.”(Moreno’s campaign said in a statement that he was “clearly making a tongue-in-cheek joke about how Sherrod Brown and members of the leftwing media like to pretend that the only issue that matters to women voters is abortion,” and that Moreno believes women “care just as much about the economy, rising prices, crime and our open southern border as male voters do.”)The Senate contest in Ohio ranked as the most expensive congressional race on record, as of October 3, with total ad spending from both parties this cycle, including future reservations, exceeding $446 million, according to AdImpact.

Debbie Stabenow, but the absence of an incumbent and the competitiveness of the presidential race in the Wolverine State makes it one that could come down to the wire.Slotkin, a third-term congresswoman, led Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers 47% to 42% among likely voters in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll, with Slotkin drawing 6% of likely voters who also said they would vote for Trump. Slotkin has a strong fundraising record – her campaign announced raising $18 million in the third quarter – but Republicans are pouring more money into this state, with the Senate Leadership Fund recently announcing a $22.5 million investment.Slotkin has been runningads on abortion– an issue that has helped propel recent Democratic victories in the state. Herspotsclaim that Rogers’ past support for abortion restrictions makes him untrustworthy on the issue now. “I’m scared that Mike Rogers will continue to take away my rights,” says one woman in a spot who says she needed an abortion to save her life.Rogers has been responding on air, speaking directly to camera while holding hands with his wife inone new spot,saying he respects Michigan voters’ decision on abortion rights and “won’t do anything to change it” in the Senate.Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, scored the endorsement of the state Farm Bureau’s PAC, which had previously backed Stabenow (the chair of the Senate Agriculture panel). Rogers, whom Democrats have attacked for living in Florida after he left Congress a decade ago, is runningspotsthat tout his Michigan roots and public service. Rogers and Republicans are alsoattacking Slotkinandthe Biden administrationover plans to support the building of electric vehicles, using the misleading term “mandate.”5. PennsylvaniaSen. Bob CaseyAndrew Harnik/Getty ImagesDemocratic Sen. Bob Casey’s race against Republican challenger Dave McCormick moves two spots up on the list in light of heavy GOP outside spending, some tighter polling and the competitiveness of the presidential race in a state that is part of Democrats’ so-called blue wall of must-win states.September polling from Marist, Quinnipiac University, the New York Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer, Franklin & Marshall, CBS News/YouGov and Fox News all gave Casey anywhere from a 5- to 9-point lead among likely voters. Polls from CNN and The Washington Post around the same time, however, showed no clear leader.The two candidates, who met on the debate stage for the first time Thursday night, have been hitting the airwaves with competing messages, as have their allied outside groups. Democrats are going after McCormick onabortion,includingonead that features footage of him referring to himself as “pro-life.” The Senate Leadership Fund, which is adding $28 million to GOP sending here, and the pro-McCormickKeystone Renewal PAChave been attacking Casey over inflation andimmigration.McCormick’s tenure as the CEO of FreeMarkets – a Pittsburgh-based software company – has also been featured in ads on both sides.The Democratic group WinSenateis accusing him ofoutsourcing jobsand pointing to his management of the company to argue that “Connecticut Dave”  – he owns a home in the Nutmeg State – “wants to buy our Senate seat.” McCormick is running ads featuringformer FreeMarkets employeespraising him and touting the company’s hiring policies.6. WisconsinSen. Tammy BaldwinMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesWisconsin also moves up two spots on the list amid signs that some Republicans could be drifting home toward their party’s nominee, Eric Hovde, in his challenge to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.The two-term senator maintained a modest edge over Hovde in aMarquette University Law School pollreleased this week – 51% to 45% among likely voters when third-party candidates are included and 53% to 46% in a head-to-head matchup. Baldwin had a similar 7-point lead in aNew York Times/Siena College surveyof the two-person race taken around the same time.While Baldwin has repeatedly outraised Hovde, the Senate Leadership Fund is also pouring funds – $17 million – into the Badger State, and Hovde has plenty of his own money to pay for ads at the lower candidate rate if he chooses. (We’ll be eying his third-quarter fundraising filing for details about how much the Sunwest Bank CEO had loaned his campaign through September.) Ads from Hovde – whose campaign recently underwent a shakeup – havesought to tie Baldwinto Harris, attacking her over border security, fentanyl andtransgender rights.But Baldwin, who’s made an effort tovisit the red, rural parts of Wisconsin, has a well-defined brand. She picked up theendorsementof the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation this week – a notable get for a Democrat running statewide. Much of Democratic advertising has played up Hovde’s past controversial comments and sought to cast him as a California carpetbagger – he owns property in Laguna Beach, even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin and his family’s company is a prominent state brand.7. ArizonaSen. Kyrsten SinemaAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileArizona is a conservative-leaning purple state, where Republicans should ordinarily be able to pick off a Senate seat – especially an open one. But in the race to replace retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, Republican candidate Kari Lake seems to have hit a ceiling.The 2022 gubernatorial nominee is well known in the state, but not necessarily for the right reasons. She still refuses to accept her loss for governor and, despite tethering herself to Trump, is underperforming his polling numbers.Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego led Lake by 10 points among likely voters in aMarist polland 13 points in aFox News survey, both from mid-September. Lake was polling behind Trump in both surveys by 6 points and 8 points respectively.Lake and the NRSC areblaming Gallegofor inflation and immigration – pointing to his support for what they’re calling the “Kamala Inflation Act.” (Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.) And while the Senate Leadership Fund hasn’t spent here, a Club for Growth-affiliated group is also airingattackson the congressman. Gallego, a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was on the airwaves for months introducing himself to voters statewide as a Marine veteran and istouting his supportfrom law enforcement andRepublican voters. He announced raising $21.7 million in the third quarter.8. NevadaSen. Jacky RosenAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileNevada moves down two spots on the list as Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen appears to be in a stronger position against Republican opponent Sam Brown in a state where Democratic prospects seem to have picked up since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.Rosen, who appeared at a Harris rally in Las Vegas earlier this week, led Brown by 10 points in aCNN pollin late August. Like Lake in Arizona, Brown – an Army veteran who first ran for office in Texas and lost the GOP primary for Nevada’s other Senate seat last year – also appears to be running up against a ceiling.Rosen and Democrats are hitting Brownover his previous stances on abortion– which is on the ballot this year in Nevada. Brown, who says he supports current state law legalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks, has said he’d “close the door” on backing a national abortion ban.Rosen has had a fundraising edge over her opponent, and this week, national Republicans canceled their remaining independent expenditures in the state in favor of running hybrid ads with Brown, which allows them to benefit from the lower candidate rate in the ultra-pricey Las Vegas media market — a strategy they’ve employed in races across the country to try to compete with well-funded Democratic candidates on the airwaves.9. TexasSen. Ted CruzTierney L. Cross/Getty Images/FileNational Democrats’ decision toinvest TV resourcesin Texas was the first major signal the party is putting money where its mouth is on the competitiveness of the Lone Star State this year. Democrats see Republican Sen. Ted Cruz as unpopular and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred, as the man to beat him, even in a state that is still comfortably red at the presidential level.The first hybridadbetween Allred and the DSCC features Kate Cox, the woman who had to leave the state to seek an abortion after her fetus had been diagnosed with a deadly condition, and Amanda Zurawski, who sued the state after she was denied an abortion when experiencing complications. “If you’re experiencing pregnancy complications in Texas, you’re in danger,” Zurawski says in the ad, “and it’s Ted Cruz and the anti-abortion extremists’ fault.”Allred has also tried to flip the script on Republicans byaccusing Cruzof “doing nothing to secure the border.” Cruz, in turn, isattacking Allredover a vote related to the inclusion of transgender athletes in women’s sports. “Boys and girls are different,” is how anotheradfrom the Republican opens. “This election is about keeping Texas Texas,” Cruz has said.Cruz only beat Democrat Beto O’Rourke by 3 points in 2018. But Democrats hope that Allred, a former NFL player who flipped a Dallas-area House seat the same year, is a more formidable challenger and can turn out more minority voters. (Allred would be the state’s first Black senator if he wins.)Even Republicans acknowledge that Allred is running a good race, and the NRSC is investing here to help Cruz and the state party. Still, Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, so this remains an uphill battle for Allred.10. MarylandSen. Ben CardinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/GettyImages/FileThe race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin remains in tenth place this month as Angela Alsobrooks fights to keep this seat in party hands. Joe Biden won Maryland by 33 points in 2020, but Republican nominee Larry Hogan – a popular former two-term governor – has a supportive super PAC committing $18 million to tout hisindependence.Alsobrooks, the Prince George’s County executive, led Hogan by 11 points in a recentWashington Post/University of Maryland poll. She’s become better known statewide and has made gains among voters who say they care about Democrats maintaining control of the Senate. The argument that Hogan would be another vote for Senate Republicans has been Democrats’central pitchin deep-blue Maryland, especially onabortion rightsand Trump.Voters in the Post survey were split over whether Hogan would back his party’s leaders in the Senate. He’s winning nearly half of independents, as well as 18% of Democrats. And as he tries to combat Democratic attacks over abortion rights, he’s run ads about being“the ultimate girl dad”and “one of the few Republicans who never caved” to Trump. Hogan rejected the former president’s endorsement earlier this year, but Democrats quickly seized on Trump saying that he’d like to see Hogan win.Maryland’s Future, the super PAC backing Hogan, is trying to localize the race byattacking Alsobrooksfor improperly taking advantage of tax breaks she did not qualify for, as firstreported by CNN. (Her senior adviser told CNN that she was unaware of the problem and that her attorneys are working with both the District of Columbia and Prince George’s County to resolve the issue.)CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report.","Score: 0

cnn,These are the states where abortion rights will – or could – be on the ballot in November,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/28/politics/state-abortion-ballot-measure-vote-dg/index.html,"CNN—This November, voters in at least 10 states will take to the polls to determine the future of abortion access in their state, after a nationwide effort by organizers to secure a wave of ballot measures aimed at restoring or protecting the right to an abortion — and some aimed at restricting it.Abortion rights advocates hope the effort will restore the issue of reproductive health access to the people, after the Supreme Court’sDobbs decisionoverturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the national right to an abortion.Most of the proposed ballot measures aim to enshrine the right to an abortion in state constitutions. They follow a series of restrictivetrigger lawsthat went into effect following the Dobbs decision, along with abortion policies that were handed down by politicians or decided by state supreme courts since the decision.Anti-abortion organizers backed a handful of initiatives aimed at restricting abortion access, thoughsimilar restrictive measures have failedin the few states where votes have been held in the past couple of years.Abortion measures on the ballot in NovemberTen states — Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and South Dakota — have already secured abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. All eyes are on Florida, which has served as a critical access point for people seeking services in a region of the country that is fast becoming anabortion care desert. A six-week abortion banreplaced the state’s 15-week banon May 1.Nebraska Secretary of State Robert Evnen announced in August that for the first time in the state’s history, two conflicting petition efforts made the same ballot.Now voters in Nebraska will voteon whether abortion rights will be enshrined in the constitution or whether the state’s current 12-week ban will be preserved.In this May 2023 photo, hundreds of people gather at the Nebraska Capitol to protest against a proposed abortion ban.Margery Beck/APRelated articleNebraska ballot can include competing measures to expand or limit abortion rights, high court rulesAfter organizers secured the New York Equal Rights Amendment on the 2024 ballot, it was briefly struck from the ballot by a state judge. State Attorney General Letitia James appealed that decision, and a state appeals court restored the measure to the ballot in June.A measure in Missouri that seeks to broadly protect reproductive care has made it onto the ballot, while an opposing measure to permanently ban abortion never made it out of the state’s legislative session.States with potential abortion ballot measuresOrganizers in states across the country have continued to work to secure funding, gather signatures and jump through the legal hoops necessary to secure abortion measures on the 2024 ballot.In most states, the process entails collecting a certain number of signatures by a designated deadline, while others require the additional step of having the ballot language approved by a state court, according to campaign organizers. The abortion rights measures are largely backed by coalitions of reproductive health advocates, many of which have fundraised to secure the money to support the campaigns.Organizers in Arkansas collected and submitted signatures for a proposed abortion rights measure, but the Secretary of State rejected their petition, saying the organizers did not correctly submit paperwork regarding paid canvassers. The state’s supreme court sided with the secretary, ensuring the measure will not be on the ballot this November.Lawmaker proposed measures in Iowa and Missouri to restrict or exclude the right to abortion in state constitutions did not make it out of legislative sessions. Lawmakers in Pennsylvania proposed a measure barring the use of public funding for abortions, which is unlikely to pass the state legislature.States that have voted on abortion post-DobbsSeven states have already seen a vote on abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and reproductive health advocates have been heartened by the overwhelming support for abortion access among voters. Every measure aimed at protecting abortion access has passed, while all measures to restrict it have failed.While support for abortion access is considered a given in states like California, organizers say these votes offer an important layer of legal protection for patients and providers – and send a message to elected officials about what voters want.CNN’s Molly English contributed to this report.","Score: -1

- The article predominantly highlights efforts by abortion rights advocates and the measures aimed at protecting abortion access, which may suggest a slight bias towards pro-abortion rights perspectives.
- It mentions the failure of restrictive measures and the success of protective measures, which could be interpreted as emphasizing the pro-abortion rights viewpoint.

cnn,What happens if there’s a tie in 2024? Be ready for a ‘contingent election’,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/politics/tie-presidential-election-what-matters/index.html,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.CNN—When Robert F. Kennedy Jr.suspended his presidential campaign, he did it in the most complicated way.Get your head around this: Kennedy will take himself off the ballot in certain key states, but he is encouraging supporters to vote for him in safe red and blue states so that he can feature in a “contingent election” if former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris tie.In the battleground states, Kennedy said he’s supporting Trump.Could Kennedy actually feature in a “contingent election?” Short answer: No. He could not take part unless he won electoral votes, something that does not seem to be mathematically possible. Perhaps he’s envisioning an elector going rogue and supporting him in defiance of voters, but Kennedy did not share details of his thinking.For the facts about contingent elections, read on.With two presidential candidates fighting over a mere 538 Electoral College votes, a tie scenario is more than possible. It’s actually kind of surprising there has only been one tied election so far, in 1800, between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.That tie was the result of a failure of coordination by Democratic-Republicans, but it led to the nation’s first “contingent election,” decided in the House of Representatives.Could a tie actually happen this year?Yes. While a tie is not a likely outcome, it is something to be ready for. Here is one plausible scenario for the 2024 election:If Harris wins Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada and a single electoral vote in Nebraska, all of which Joe Biden won in 2020, but she loses Pennsylvania and Georgia, there’s a tie, 269-269.The website270 to Winalso has more tied-election scenarios.Unlike every other state, Maine and Nebraska award two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner of each congressional district. Those individual, competitive electoral votes in Maine and Nebraska become hugely consequential in potential tie scenarios.Make your own 269-269 scenario withCNN’s interactive election map.What happens if there’s a tie?If there’s a 269-269 tie, or if a third party or independent candidate wins electoral votes and keeps a candidate from reaching an Electoral College majority of 270, the next step is the same. It’s called a “contingent election.”According to the12th Amendment, enacted in the wake of that divisive 1800 election, if no candidate gets a majority of the Electoral College votes, the new Congress, which would have just been sworn in on January 3, chooses the president. The Senate would choose the vice president.When would a ‘contingent election’ occur?According to an analysis by theCongressional Research Service, a contingent election would occur on January 6, immediately after members of Congress met to count electoral votes and determined that no candidate had a majority.There is a lot of information from that CRS report in this story. While it dates back to 2017, it’s still a valuable resource.How would the process work?The nation would clearly be divided. Lawmakers could be torn between supporting their preferred candidate and the one their state’s voters preferred.In a contingent election, the House selects the president and the Senate selects the vice president. House members can only choose from among the top three finishers in the Electoral College for president, and senators can choose from among the top two finishers for vice president. Kennedy would presumably need to win electoral votes – win a state or a congressional district in Nebraska or Maine – in order to be an option in a contingent election. There’s no chance of that happening at the moment.Rather than voting as individuals, each state delegation in the House would get one vote, although how the state delegations select their preferred candidate is not spelled out.A simple majority, 26 state delegation votes, would appoint the new president.If state delegations in the House did not select a president by Inauguration Day, January 20, the new vice president selected by the Senatewould become temporary president. It is possible the Senate could select a vice president when the House is deadlocked, because in the Senate each senator would get one vote.If the Senate had not selected a vice president by January 20, the presidential succession plan in the 20th Amendment temporarily takes effect. First in line after the vice president is the speaker of the House, currently Mike Johnson, although it could be a different Republican or a Democrat if Democrats win a majority in the House this November.Does either side have an advantage?If the Electoral College already benefits smaller and more rural states, the contingent election process – in which each state, regardless of population, has an equal vote – gives them a huge advantage.California and Texas get the same say as Delaware and Wyoming in a contingent election. Plus, Washington, DC, which gets three votes in the Electoral College, would be cut out of the contingent election.There’s nothing to require state delegations to honor the winner of their state’s vote. And in closely divided states, the results in single seats, perhaps determined by gerrymandered congressional maps, could swing a delegation’s vote.CNNRelated articleWhat to expect in the sprint to Election Day – and beyondHeading into the 2024 election, Republican lawmakers held a majority in 26 states, compared with Democrats, who held the majority in 22, with ties in Minnesota and North Carolina. Republicans in North Carolina have changed the state’s congressional map, however, and it is likely to have a majority-Republican congressional delegation in January. Republicans are likely to maintain their advantage next year, especially if voters are so split that they deliver a national tie at the top of the ticket.In Arizona, for instance, who is to say that a potential majority of Republican members of Congresswould vote for the Democratic candidate, even if Harris pulled out a narrow win there?Would Alaska’s Democratic member of Congress, assuming she wins reelection, vote for the Democrat for president even though her state is likely to go for Trump in November?Why does this bizarre tie-break system exist?It’s actually meant to be an improvement. The way the Electoral College was first assembled, electors voted for two candidates. Whoever got the most votes was president and whoever got the second-most votes was vice president.By the time political parties were forming – Federalists and Democratic-Republicans in 1800 – electors needed to coordinate to cast more votes for their presidential pick than their vice presidential pick.In the1800 election, a rematch of 1796, Jefferson’s Democratic-Republicans beat incumbent President and Federalist John Adams.But the Democratic-Republicans were poorly coordinated or bad at counting and foolishly cast equal numbers of votes for their presidential pick, Jefferson, and his running mate, Burr.Out of pique, when the early version of the contingent election rolled around, the Federalists, who still controlled the House at that time, backed Burr. Despite the intervention of Alexander Hamilton, a noted Federalist, it took 36 rounds of voting to finally elect Jefferson.By 1804, the 12th Amendment was being ratified.Has a contingent election happened in the years since the tied election of 1800?Yes.In 1824, multiple candidates got votes in the Electoral College but none of them received a majority, triggering a contingent election.Amazingly, from today’s perspective, all of the candidates who got Electoral College votes that year were from the same Democratic-Republican political party, although they were split into regional sects.Andrew Jackson won 40% of the popular vote and got the most votes in the Electoral College with 99 of the 131needed for victory. But the House ultimately picked his top rival, John Quincy Adams, whose father lost that 1800 election.Jackson would have his revenge with a victory four years later, and John Quincy Adams would round out his career as the only former president to be elected to Congress, the body that made him president.Another contingent election occurred with the 1836 race, but just for vice president. Virginia’s electors did not like Robert M. Johnson, the running mate of election winner Martin Van Buren, and withheld their votes for him in the Electoral College. The Senate later elevated Johnson to the vice presidency in a contingent election.What about the disputed election of 1876?In 1876, when there was a contested outcome, the contingent election system was bypassed.That year, at the height of Reconstruction, the issue was not that no person got a majority in the Electoral College, but rather that three Southern states – Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina – sent multiple slates of electoral votes to Washington, DC, after the state elections were disputed. And in Oregon, there was a dispute over one elector.Congress created a special bipartisan commission, with one more Republican than Democrats, to determine which candidate should get the 20 disputed electoral votes. They ultimately gave the votes to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes even though Democrat Samuel Tilden got more popular votes.Hayes thenlargely ended Reconstruction, perhaps as part of a secret deal that gave him the White House.This story has been updated with additional developments.","Score: 0

The October 1vice presidential debatebetween Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrat, and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican, was likely the last meeting between the Democratic campaign led by Vice President Kamala Harris and the Republican campaign led by former President Donald Trump.While the scene is set for what pollsters expect could be an extremely close election,there will be unexpected developments between now and Election Day on November 5.Nobody expected President Joe Biden’scampaign to implodeafter theshock of his performance at CNN’s debate in late June. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Harris as his replacement.Nobody expected anassassination attempt against Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience.So we don’t know specifically what will happen between now andElection Day, or what could come after, when the country’s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect:Voting is well underwayCNNRelated articleYour personalized voter handbook for the presidential electionWhile Election Day isn’t until November 5, most states allow some kind of early voting, either by mail or in person, and that process kicks into overdrive in October.Most Americans, nearly 70%, voted early or by mail in 2020, according tocensus figures, although that figure was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.The campaigns will be focused on getting out the vote in the few key battleground states they think are up for grabs. In 2020, Biden won five states that Trump won in 2016. Those states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – could again be the focus in 2024 when Harris, who turns 60 in October, takes on Trump.It’s important to be sure you’re registered to vote as soon as possible, which can usually be done online. Twenty-three states and Washington, DC, allow Election Day voter registration.Election Day and beyondUS law requires federal elections to take place on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that’s November 5.People who don’t vote early will hit their local voting location. Polls will close at different times around the country. Due to the rise of voting by mail, if key states are close, like they were in 2020, we probably won’t know the winner on Election Day.Regardless, expect lawsuits in certain states and the potential for recounts in others. Election Day is far from the end of the election.Separately,Trump’s sentencingon 34 counts of falsifying business records is now scheduled for November 26.Also this month: Biden turns 82.December: Electoral votes are castAfter questions about the election are settled, states confirm, or ascertain, their statewide results. Electors gather in their respective state capitols to cast electoral votes for their statewide winner.Nebraska and Maine also allocate some electoral votes by congressional district, and these could be pivotal in a close race.January: Someone will solemnly swearThe new Congress takes the oath of office on January 3. It’s this new Congress that, in the unlikely event ofan Electoral College tie, would settle the election. Each state would get one vote for president in the House of Representatives.In any event, lawmakers gather on January 6, as everyone should remember from 2020, to count electoral votes. Harris will preside.

cnn,Milwaukee’s Black voters expose cracks in Democratic foundation for Harris,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/11/politics/milwaukee-black-voters-kamala-harris/index.html,"Milwaukee, WisconsinCNN—Devonta Johnson is going door to door, clipboard in hand, wearing a bright yellow vest and a seemingly permanent smile.“How do you feel about Kamala Harris?” Johnson asks when a woman answers the door and steps out onto the porch.“I think she is great,” the woman says, and Johnson’s smile gets even bigger.“How do you feel about Trump?” he asks.“Not so great,” is the quick response.The conversation lasts another minute or so, as Johnson runs through early voting opportunities and asks for a phone number so he can check back and make sure supporting Harris translates into voting for her. Then a pleasant goodbye, and Johnson turns back to the sidewalk and heads to the next knock.Johnson and his colleagues from Black Leaders Organizing for Communities walk these streets year-round. But their steps are now a bit quicker and the falling leaves add a little color and crunching sound. The Halloween decorations on the lawn tell us the calendar is moving. So does the new script the canvassers are carrying.“I just wanted to remind you that early voting starts on October 22,” one says to a man who steps out to talk.It is turnout time, and any path to a Democratic victory in Wisconsin – which flipped from Trump to Joe Biden four years ago – begins in these overwhelmingly Black neighborhoods on Milwaukee’s north side.“There’s a lot of momentum,” says Angela Lang, a veteran organizer who is the BLOC executive director. “Generally speaking, people feel pretty good about where we are at.”The energy and activism among Black women is obvious. Plus, Lang says, her conversations with other organizers suggest perhaps a few surprises in the Wisconsin count.“You can’t win a statewide election here without going through the heart of Milwaukee and in some cases that runs through this office and the work that our team does,” Lang said in an interview. “But we are also seeing folks in heavily red areas that are getting together with other women at coffee shops without their husbands knowing, for example, and starting to have those conversations.”Veteran organizer Angela Lang, the founder and executive director of BLOC (Black Leaders Organizing for Communities), speaks to canvassers about the state of the presidential race.CNNWe first visited Lang and BLOC a year ago, in the early weeks of our CNN project –“All Over The Map”– to track the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are members of crucial voting blocs.It is obvious that Harris is in better shape now than Biden was during that first visit last October.Back then, even Johnson, then 21, said he was not sure who he would vote for, describing Biden and Trump as too old and disconnected from his generation. Now, he is as excited to vote for Harris as he is to knock doors organizing for her and other Democrats.“At the time, I was like kind of iffy, feeling like everybody else, kind of undecided,” Johnson said of his choices before Harris got in the race. “But now that Kamala got the ball and she rollin’ with it, I feel like oh yeah. … She’s making a good image for herself and for the Democrats.”A year ago, Lang was blunt about Biden’s struggles in Milwaukee’s Black neighborhoods. Now she says there is energy around Harris and myriad efforts to find creative ways to generate high turnout.“It’s extremely different,” Lang said.Cracks in the Democratic coalitionYet she candidly discussed cracks and concerns in the Democratic foundation, which were on clear display as we walked with the canvassers and sat in on the meeting in which they share notes about what they call being “on doors.”Some who answer don’t plan to vote.“Because they say it isn’t going to change anything,” one of the canvassers said at the meeting.Young Black voters are harder to motivate.“We still got a job to do,” one of the canvassers told her colleagues. “They have a lot of questions that’s not answered.”But by far the biggest worry is Black men.Two things come up the most.“People are, like, ‘I think I had more money in my pocket when Trump was in office because of the stimulus checks during the pandemic,’” Lang said.She tells canvassers to point out Congress passed that funding and that Trump initially opposed the idea, though he in the end had his signature printed on the checks.The second concern is about how Harris got her start in politics: as a county prosecutor and later as California’s attorney general.“It makes sense why people may have a little bit of a pause,” Lang said of the vice president’s background in law enforcement. “I myself did as well.”Now she tells canvassers that a key Harris priority as a prosecutor were programs designed to reduce recidivism.‘They look at a man as being a leader’Undecided Wisconsin voter Brian McMutuary lists the rising cost of living as one of his main concerns.Jacqueline Kalil/CNNBrian McMutuary says he is open to listening in the final days. He was a lifelong Democrat until he voted for Trump in 2020.He disagrees with Trump on abortion rights and immigration. But he likes the former president’s take on cryptocurrency and remembers being better off when Trump was president.“When I go to the grocery store, I get what I need, not so much what I want or what the kids want,” McMutuary said in an interview in Menomonee Falls, a Milwaukee suburb. “We need to make it each week. We have a budget, you know. It is tight.”McMutuary also says he worries Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping would not treat Harris as an equal.“They look at a man as being a leader,” he said.He said he had no problem with a woman president.“Nope, not at all,” McMutuary said. “It’s about doing the right thing for the country.”Eric Jones says he has heard that and more as he makes the rounds getting coffee, going to the barbershop or in his real estate business.“If I were a gambling man, I would probably put my money on Harris,” Jones told us in an interview at Confectionately Yours, a new Black-owned coffee shop and bakery on Milwaukee’s Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.Milwaukee-based entrepreneur Eric Jones describes the change in ""energy"" and voter enthusiasm since Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee.Jacqueline Kalil/CNN“Things are getting better,” Jones said. “The numbers are better. The energy is different. It’s a lot different from when we were here last time, especially in terms of the election.”Still, he sees the same cracks and doubts relayed by the BLOC community organizers, especially among Black men.“They’ll say, ‘I had more money when he was the president,’’’ Jones said.Harris’ work as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general might help woo suburban voters but, at a minimum, raises questions here.“Law enforcement has not been kind to Black people historically,” Jones said. “District attorneys have not been kind to Black people historically.”Jones also says abortion and transgender rights have come up in some recent debates at stops in the community.“The good old party feels they have a monopoly on the Christian vote,” Jones said. “The Democratic Party feels they have a monopoly over the Black vote. The problem is there are a lot of Blacks that are Christians and the Black church is one of the strongest institutions in the Black community, right?”“So you have this tug of war in a city that I’m pretty sure the Black folk will decide who wins that city, and more than likely, the presidency.”","Score: -1

cnn,"Michigan young voters enthused for Harris, but their level of support is still a big question",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/politics/michigan-students-kamala-harris-israel-hamas/index.html,"Ann Arbor, MichiganCNN—The campus art museum doubles as a voting hub. There are voter registration tables seemingly everywhere. Even the sleeves at the campus coffee shop have a message: “Wolverines: Let’s Vote Early.”So Jade Gray bristles a bit at this hypothetical: What if Kamala Harris comes up just short in battleground Michigan?“If she comes up short in Michigan, I don’t think it’s because of young voters,” said Gray, a former co-president of the University of Michigan College Democrats who graduated in May. “I think it’s probably because we waited too long to make a switch of the candidate.”Voters aged 18-29 area vital pieceof the Democratic coalition. They were crucial toJoe Biden’s2020 Michigan win and in the dramatic state-level gains the party made in 2022. But young voters’ level of support is a big question for 2024 because of anger and disappointment with how the Biden-Harris administration has handledthe Israel-Hamas conflict.“I don’t think there is any blame to put on young people or people of color or Muslim voters in this election cycle, and I quite frankly don’t really want to hear about that,” Gray said in an interview. “I think that you got to put that on campaigns, and you have to put that on the elected officials that are running for office. I sure hope she doesn’t come up short in Michigan, because I don’t really want to be talking to people about how young people should have done more when I feel like we’re doing a lot.”The conversation with Gray and Anushka Jalisatgi, also co-president of the College Democrats last school year, was our third in 11 months. Both are part of a CNN project, calledAll Over the Map, designed to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are part of crucial voting blocs.In the twoprior conversations, both said Biden’s age was a concern for many young voters who felt little connection to the octogenarian president. Now, with Harris as the Democratic nominee, the energy and enthusiasm difference is obvious.Gray now works as a digital organizer for a progressive group.“I have noticed a significant shift in activity, across the board,” Gray said.Jalisatgi is back on campus as a first-year law student, and just switched her voter registration to Michigan.“A lot of my out-of-state friends are switching their registration to Michigan because it is a battleground state,” Jalisatgi said.The voting hub at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.CNNAnd while Gray and Jalisatgi have moved on, the College Democrats are in high gear for election crunch time. A Harris campaign official stopped by a meeting during our latest visit and a crowded room of students spent time phone banking after getting a pep talk from the state’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer.“The work that you are doing is so important and I am energized by what I see happening with all these Dem clubs on campuses. You are kicking a**. So, we just got to keep rolling through,” Whitmer said over a video link.Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell stopped by in person, and warned against overconfidence.“I’m going to look you all in the eye and tell you, neither candidate is winning in Michigan right now.”No encampment on campus, but tensions still high over Israel-Hamas conflictThe almost everywhere-you-look focus on registration and early voting at the Ann Arbor campus is remarkable.One registration table we stopped by on our latest visit was in a familiar spot: on the same campus path where students last semester built an encampment to air their grievances at Israel, at the Biden administration and at school officials they were pushing to divest from companies that do business with Israel.The school will not allow a new encampment, so it is harder to gauge how much the raw anger of last semester has carried over to the new school year – and into voting decisions.“A lot of that energy, because it can’t happen in a physical space – it’s still occupying a lot of online space,” Gray said.Jalisatgi sees it directed less at Harris and more at university officials.“People still very much care that this is ongoing and that the university is complicit in contributing to it,” Jalisatgi said. “I’m seeing universities putting out a lot of new free speech guidelines, new regulations for how they want to curb free speech or how they want to regulate it.”University of Michigan student Max Scheske walks with John King on campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan.CNNThe Ann Arbor College Republicans would not let CNN into a meeting they held during our recent visit.Member Max Scheske, a junior, said attendance and energy are up some as the election draws close. But he also said the group was pretty evenly divided when it comes to enthusiasm forDonald Trump.“We certainly do have our, you know, ‘Trump is basically Jesus’ wing of the club,” Scheske said. “But we do have a very sizeable, you know, very critical of Trump.”Scheske describes himself as libertarian and Trump as a populist. “So, he is kind of hit or miss with me,” Scheske said.There are Harris yard signs and posters and placards all around Ann Arbor. Signs of Trump support are much harder to find. On campus, Scheske said Trump’s unequivocal support for Israel makes it harder to win over Democrats critical of the Biden-Harris administration’s defense of the Jewish state.“If it was up to me, he would not have been the Republican nominee,” Scheske said.‘We feel a sense of betrayal’The biggest risk for Harris is that young voters stay home, skip the presidential line on the ballot, or vote third party.In May, Wayne State student Summer Matkin was leaning third party. Biden was the Democratic nominee then, and she had concerns both about his age and the Israel-Hamas conflict.Now, she calls Harris “the safest option” even though she is frustrated the bloodshed in the Middle East continues.There were signs of trouble for Harris, though, when we stopped by a meeting of the Wayne State Syrian Students Association.The roughly 20 students in the room did not want to be quoted by name or have their faces captured on camera. But when asked if they would have a hard time voting for Harris, nearly every hand in the room went up.Wayne State student Wahbeh Nuseibeh talks with John King in Dearborn, Michigan.CNNLikewise, Wahbeh Nuseibeh, a 26-year-old Wayne State student, said he would not vote for Harris in 2024 after voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020.“We feel a sense of betrayal,” said Nuseibeh, who is Palestinian.“I’m not voting for Kamala Harris. I cannot in good conscience,” he said. In his view, his tax dollars pay for bombs shipped to Israel “to kill my friends and family overseas.”Nuseibeh will likely choose a third-party option.“Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy and a threat to our society,” he said in an interview at a Yemeni coffee shop in majority Arab American Dearborn just outside Detroit.Maya Siegmann will cast her vote for Harris, though she found the vice president’s debate answers far too vague.“She didn’t directly answer most of the questions and seemed to go around them or could not give a real answer,” Siegmann said. “And when the topic of the Israel-Hamas war came up, there wasn’t really a solid response as to how she would solve it.”Siegmann is active in the Hillel campus Jewish organization at Wayne State and just got back from a summer in Israel. There, she said, she was asked a lot about public opinion in the United States.“The response was basically that the propaganda war, the social media war, the news war that Hamas and Israel are fighting, Hamas is winning right now,” Siegmann said.Wayne State student Maya Siegmann talks with John King on campus in Detroit, Michigan.CNNLast year was tense on campus and as both the October 7 anniversary of Hamas’ attack on Israel and then the US election draw near, Siegmann said she is mindful that emotions could get high again. She is a proud Jew and fervent supporter of Israel, but she is also critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his conduct of the war.But she says such nuance can get quickly lost when passions get high.“I worry that when it does come up, because we have different classes, like policy classes, that it will be an argument and less a discussion.”The campus has a large Arab and Muslim population, and Siegmann said this semester she is making more of an effort to get to know classmates better.“These are people I am going to be with until I complete my degree or degrees,” she said. “So I want to kind of form that solid groundwork so that I can build off that.”","Score: -1

cnn,Economic worries boost Trump’s Hispanic support in battleground Nevada,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/nevada-hispanic-voters-trump-harris/index.html,"Henderson, NevadaCNN—The sounds of blasting and bulldozing in the hills overlooking Las Vegas are proof change is a constant here, with the new $5 million homes evidence of the vibrant, upscale demand.It is progress, longtime Las Vegas real estate agent Zoila Sanchez says, as she points out new construction from the patio of her own home in suburban Henderson. But it is also a reminder of a major economic and political issue here.Rents are on the rise, and starter homes are scarce. The wealthy can find what they want – or build it – but working-class families face a housing crunch.“Prices are extremely high – the highest they’ve ever been,” Sanchez said in an interview. “And with interest rates being really high, the affordability is not there for a lot of people.”Sanchez says a Federal Reserve interest rate cut would help, and she is counting on one soon not only to help her business and local families but also her candidate for president: Kamala Harris.“She’s a very smart lady,” Sanchez said of the vice president. “She talks to me. She just says everything that I need to hear.”That’s coming from a self-described Reagan Republican who hopes to one day soon vote GOP for president again. But not with Donald Trump atop the ticket.“I’ve never liked anything about him,” Sanchez said of the former president. “Nothing. The way he speaks. What he represents.  … You know, that we immigrants are the worst. That we are coming from mental institutions and jails and everything else. Which is not true.”Las Vegas-based real estate agent Zoila Sanchez photographed outside of her home in Henderson, Nevada.Jacqueline Kalil/CNNTrump narrowly lost Nevada in both 2016 and 2020. Sanchez concedes she hears more support for him this time among Latino voters, especially men.“I want to understand it,” she said. “And I can’t. I realty can’t. … I think it is kind of a macho thing.”When we first met last December, Sanchez was ready to vote a second time for Joe Biden, mostly because of her animus toward Trump. Now, she says she is excited to vote for Harris. “If we get to elect the first women president, I mean, I just get chills to witness history,” she said.Sanchez is confident, insisting the energy she sees for Harris outweighs the increased Trump talk among fellow Hispanics.“I know that Hispanics have made a difference in a lot of elections, and I can see it right now,” Sanchez said.Hispanic voters up for grabsRogelio Regalado and Rafael Cerros Jr. are not so sure.Close friends, Regalado and Cerros took a risk in 2020 – in the middle of the pandemic – and launched a local radio station, Fiesta 98.1. Their little startup is now No. 2 in a competitive Vegas Spanish language market.Cerros works the business side and says he is undecided in the presidential race at the moment.Regalado is the afternoon drive-time host, from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays, and describes himself as leaning Harris but eager to see her work harder for the Hispanic vote.“I feel the Democrats take the Hispanic vote for granted here in Vegas or in Nevada,” Cerros said. “We are one-third of the population. Last time I checked, it’s like 23% of voter registration.”The station has a weekend political show, and the campaign sometimes also comes up during the week when listeners call in to discuss music or compete for prizes. Plus the station is often represented at local events.Fiesta 98.1 co-owner and radio personality Rogelio Regalado prepares to go on air.Jacqueline Kalil/CNNFiesta 98.1 founding partner Rafael Cerros Jr. stands outside of the radio station’s offices in downtown Las Vegas.Jacqueline Kalil/CNN“I see people on social media, Hispanics, sharing that post ‘I’m not with Her.’ I’m, like, wow,” Regalado said.Cerros added: “A lot of people are calling me, or calling us – Latinos, you know, talking about voting for Trump.”Both said the economy is by far the biggest reason people they know who were solid Democrats are at least open to supporting Trump.“It is 100% that,” Cerros said.Nevada was crushed during the Covid pandemic because it is so reliant on tourism. The state had the highest pandemic unemployment rate, at one point just shy of 31% – more than twice the national average. The statistics now are clear: the jobs are back, and then some. But the bruises linger, and working families trying to put the pandemic stress behind them have faced housing and inflation pressures.“We have seen the record numbers at the casinos,” Regalado said. “But some businesses are struggling still.”Cerros said Fiesta 98.1’s advertisers are mostly small, Latino-owned businesses. “A lot of small businesses are struggling,” he said. “It’s not 100% yet, to where it was. Especially with inflation.”A Muslim voter who agrees with Harris on most issues is eyeing third-party optionZena Hajji presents a different problem for Harris.Muslims are just a tiny slice of Nevada’s population, but every vote and constituency matter in a battleground settled by 33,596 votes four years ago.“A lot of Muslims are angry they are being somehow — and I would say, unfortunately — partner to the issues that are happening abroad,” Hajji said in an interview at her Henderson home.“I don’t want my tax dollars to be able to hurt people, especially when I work so hard to focus on helping people here,” Hajji said.Zena Hajji opens a jar of her mother’s homemade pickled olives at their home in Henderson, Nevada.Jacqueline Kalil/CNNThe 21-year-old Democrat, who’s a proud daughter of Moroccan immigrants, stands with Harris on just about every issue. But the Biden administration’s support of Israel as the conflict with Hamas drags on leaves Hajji pondering a third-party vote or just skipping the presidential line on the ballot.“Why would you keep voting for a group of people that promises no more bombs, no more pain, peace in the Middle East,” Hajji said, noting that those vows haven’t held up. She said Harris is more explicit than Biden in calling for an end to the killing of Palestinian civilians, but that words are not enough.“We just need a ceasefire,” she said. “That’s it. We just need it to stop. … We are tired. We are very, very tired. And we don’t know what to do with our votes right now.”Leaning Harris but looking for more specificsAntonio Munoz is a man of contagious optimism. A veteran, retired police officer and now the owner of the 911 Taco Bar in El Mercado, a former JC Penny department store that now houses dozens of Hispanic small businesses.When we first met last December, he was undecided in the presidential race and unhappy with the prospect of a Biden-Trump rematch. In that meeting, he bet neither Trump nor Biden would be on the ballot in the end. He was half right.Leaning Harris is where Munoz is now – intrigued and excited but also still frustrated he cannot find more specifics about her promise to help small businesses like his.“I’ve been checking her website and you read it, but it’s not specific,” Munoz said. “We do need to move forward. We need a different plan to get over the hump with this inflation that has caused severe damage to a lot of businesses. … She needs to be more direct.”A scorching summer was the latest challenge, stifling the catering business critical to Munoz’s bottom line.“We had over 30 days of 110 degrees,” Munoz said. “So we had a lot of cancellations because people didn’t want to be outside.”Antonio Munoz, owner of 911 Taco Bar, checks in on his staff during the lunch hour rush.Jacqueline Kalil/CNNNow he sees a competitive election as a pause button.“Because people are afraid to go out and spend,” he said. “They don’t know what to expect when it comes around to a new administration.”Evidence of new energy for Harris begins at home for Munoz. He says his wife is excited, and that he shares her view that there is inspiration in the vice president’s story.“She came up with immigrant parents, which to me, it’s amazing for someone like that to come up and be able to be president,” Munoz said. “It’s a hit for people.”He also has no patience when Trump slams immigrants or berates the country he wants to lead.“One of the things that hurts me the most is for him to talk down America,” Munoz said. “America is a world leader. We have always been. … We’re the best. No matter who is there. The people make it the best.”But Munoz said many friends and others he encounters at community events are nostalgic for the pre-Covid economy and think that Trump is a better choice for their bottom line. Nevada also elected a Republican governor in 2022, and Munoz believes that makes it more hospitable climate for Trump this year.“He has grown,” Munoz said of the former president’s support among Hispanics. “I have friends that were Democrats who have turned the page. They feel that the country is not going in the right direction.”Harris, though, is more competitive than Biden would have been and Munoz predicts a Nevada nailbiter.“It’s a 50-50 tossup,” he said. “They need to be out here with a direct message and talking to the voters out here. I really think it is 50-50 right now. It is tight.”","Score: -1

cnn,Why Iowa Republicans who once opposed Trump are ready to vote for him,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/18/politics/iowa-republicans-trump-2024/index.html,"Kellerton, IowaCNN—Shanen Ebersole is voting for Donald Trump. With plenty of reservations, but zero hesitation.“It’s definitely a vote for Trump,” Ebersole said. “I’m happy doing that with the choices that we have. I don’t think there is any way I could vote any other direction.”Ebersole was a Nikki Haley supporter when we first met before the Iowa caucuses. Trump won 59% of the caucus vote in conservative Ringgold County; Ebersole was one of just 16 votes for the former South Carolina governor.Once Trump locked up the GOP nomination, Ebersole thought a bit about voting third party. But her maverick streak has limits. Her family and her farm come first, so she came home to Trump.“Because we have to put the American people first,” she said in an interview along the fence line of the Ebersole cattle farm. “I think that the policies that have been in place in the Harris-Biden administration — they hurt this. They hurt our land and they hurt the people of middle America the most.”Ebersole is part of ourAll Over the Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are members of critical voting blocs or areas in those states.John King talks to Iowa voter Shanen Ebersole on her cattle ranch in Kellerton, Iowa.CNNIowa was an early 2024 battleground — the first test of whether Trump’s grip on the GOP had been loosened by his 2020 loss, his conduct on January 6, 2021, or any of the myriad criminal and civil legal proceedings he has faced since leaving the White House.Trump won the caucuses with 51%— the beginning of a march to the nomination that proved his grip on the party remains quite firm but also exposed important weaknesses.One was among Republican women like Ebersole — those who supported Haley or other GOP contenders because they object to Trump’s combative and often caustic tone and, in many cases, see him as wandering too far from the conservative principles that drew them to the Republican Party.Iowa, of course, is not considered a battleground in the general election this year. Ebersole’s “pretty simple” decision to support Trump despite her reservations helps explain why.In the 12 presidential elections dating back to 1976, Iowa was evenly split in its choice for president. But Republicans have dominated of late. Trump won in both 2016 and 2020. Both of the state’s US senators are Republican, as are six of Iowa’s seven statewide constitutional offices.Voters who say life was better under Trump fear Democrats have shifted too far leftEbersole shared a view quite common here: that the Democratic Party is trending more liberal, more coastal, and more in favor of government mandates in climate and land policies.“I’m not saying that there are not things we can do to improve,” Ebersole said. “But if you talk to a lot of us, we’re already doing things. There’s a huge regenerative movement here in the Americas by choice, not my mandate. I think that is the main thing that matters in politics — that we get to choose. We’re not being mandated to choose. … We just want to live in the middle of nowhere and raise cows and feed our neighbors across the country.”Ebersole said Trump’s trade policies were better for her business.“It was much harder to import beef,” she said. “Now most meat that you eat, on the American grocery store shelves, isn’t American beef, and that really concerns me﻿.” She sees Vice President Kamala Harris as more liberal — and more likely to favor activist government — than President Joe Biden.“She is willing to push her agendas on those of us who live a totally different life,” Ebersole said, tying Harris to California’s policies. “Our California rancher friends are completely decimated by the policies and the government. Not by their weather conditions, not by any of those things, but by the government policies.”Harris was the California attorney general from 2011-2017 and has worked in Washington since becoming a senator and now vice president.The conversation is different here than in the swing states. On recent visits toArizonaandPennsylvania, for example, some of our Republican voters who are not Trump fans said they would give Harris a chance to make her case. But in Iowa, the Republicans in our group were harshly critical of the vice president and more comfortable with coming home to the GOP despite issues they may have with Trump and his most vocal MAGA allies.“Most of the people that vote for Trump are just quiet people who want to live our own lives in our own place,” Ebersole said. “We’re willing to tell those people to quiet down a bit.”It may seem an odd time to visit Iowa, given its status as a solid red state, when considering each candidate’s strategy to win 270 electoral votes. But we wanted to better understand why those who were so critical of Trump at the beginning of the campaign cycle are so comfortable supporting him now. We wanted a firsthand look at how our Iowa group — the first one we visited in August 2023 — views the race now that Harris has replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket and chosen a Midwest governor, Tim Walz of Minnesota, to be her running mate.“He’s trying to figure out how to deal with her,” Chris Mudd, a businessman from Cedar Falls, said of Trump, whom he ardently supports. “I think he spends too much time bashing and complaining. … I think he’ll catch his stride. I think he will get back on his horse.”John King talks with Iowa voter Chris Mudd in Cedar Falls.CNNMudd owns Midwest Solar, and business is strong in part because of Biden administration clean energy tax incentives.But Mudd would gladly give up that help in exchange for Trump’s policies on regulation and immigration.“If all I was selling was government incentives, I don’t think business would be very good,” Mudd said in an interview at his home. “But that’s not what we’re selling. We’re selling the power to help people save money.”Mudd also believes Trump is more tested on the world stage.“I think about what’s happening in the Middle East,” Mudd said. “Who would I want to negotiate that peace? Kamala or Donald Trump? And for me, it’s simple.”Mudd believes the media is too soft on Harris, and he echoes Trump and his MAGA media allies in complaining the vice president rarely takes questions from reporters. He also echoes another line coming from Trump, suggesting there is no way Harris can win an honest election.“There were shenanigans,” Mudd said when asked what he would think if Harris wins the White House. “I don’t think she has a chance to win in a fair fight. … I just don’t believe it is possible. I really don’t. … Many like me would think the same thing: If Kamala Harris gets 81 million votes, something really went haywire.”Previously leaning toward Biden in a 2020 rematch, but now for TrumpBetsy Sarcone considers such talk a waste of time.“I don’t buy the stolen election,” said Sarcone, a mother of three who lives in the Des Moines suburbs. “If she wins, she wins. I am not getting on that bandwagon.”But the fact that Sarcone plans to vote for Trump is a big change from our first conversation just over a year ago.Then, she said it was time for the Republican Party to find new leadership and that if the 2024 election ended up as a 2020 rematch, she would vote for Biden.John King sits with Iowa voter Betsy Sarcone and her family in West Des Moines, Iowa.CNNBut Sarcone said grocery prices are still too high, her real estate business too slow.“I would describe myself as being resigned to voting for Donald Trump,” Sarcone said. “I just can’t vote for the status quo and I was absolutely better off during Donald Trump’s presidency than I am today.”Sarcone has a dim view of Harris.“She’s already been in office,” she said. “She could have done something about the economy. She could have done something about the border.”Like the others in our Iowa group, Sarcone places Harris to the left of Biden.“I’d say far left,” she said. “I’d say woke.”Sarcone sees Trump as rattled by the switch to Harris.“I think he is handling it wrong,” she said. “I wish that he would stick to the issues and cut the side conversations that are not relevant.”John King and Iowa voter Priscilla Forsyth at a baseball game in Sioux City, Iowa.CNNSioux City attorney Priscilla Forsyth, too, sees Trump as off his game now that Harris is his opponent.“She’s pulling his chain,” Forsyth said. “I don’t think he knows what to think.”When we first met Forsyth last August, she was impressed with another GOP candidate, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Soon, though, she would label him shallow and childish and shift her allegiance to Haley.Now, though, Forsyth sees Harris as “radical” and has no qualms about voting for Trump.“I see Kamala and I see Walz as being so far left it concerns me,” Forsyth said in an interview.“I’m comfortable with Trump. We had four years of Trump. We know what Trump is. We know what to expect. We all survived. … I’m not voting for him to be my valentine. I’m not voting for him to be my best friend. I think he did an OK job running the country.”","Score: 1

cnn,Fact check: Vance falsely claims Trump did not ‘go after his political opponents’ as president,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/fact-check-vance-trump-political-opponents/index.html,"WashingtonCNN—Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, falsely claimed Sunday that former President Donald Trump “didn’t go after his political opponents” during his presidency – an assertion that is contradicted by a mountain of evidence.Vance, who saidFridaythat the attorney general would be the most important government official other than the president in a second Trump administration, wasaskedby ABC News host Martha Raddatz in an interview on Sunday if Trump would go after his political opponents. Vance said no, thenadded, “Martha, he was president for four years and he didn’t go after his political opponents.”Facts First:Vance’s claim is false. As president, Trump publicly and privately pressured the Justice Department, and others in his administration, to investigate or prosecute numerous political opponents.Trump madeextensive behind-the-scenes effortsto get his political opponents charged with crimes. But you don’t have to rely on investigative reporting or the memoirs of former administration officials to know that Trump went after political opponents as president.He often went after them in public, too.As CNN reporter Marshall Cohen hasnoted, there is a long list of political opponents whom Trump publicly called for the Justice Department and others to investigate or prosecute. The list includes not only 2016 election opponentHillary Clintonand 2020 election opponentJoe Bidenbut alsoBiden’s son Hunter Biden,Democratic former Secretary of State John Kerry,Trump’s former national security advisor turned critic John Bolton,Democratic former President Barack Obama,unspecified Obama administration officials,the anonymous author of a New York Times op-ed by a Trump administration official critical of Trump,MSNBC host and Trump critic Joe Scarborough,former FBI director turned Trump critic James Comey,other former FBI officials,former British spy Christopher Steele(the author of a controversial dossier of allegations against Trump), and various congressional Democrats – includingformer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,Rep. Adam Schiff of California,Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota,Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, andSen. Mark Warner of Virginia.Asked for comment for this article on Monday, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk accused the media of having a biased “double standard” and said “it is indisputable that under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s DOJ, the Republican nominee for president was targeted and indicted, while under President Trump, nothing like that ever transpired against either of the Democrats he faced off with in 2016 or 2020.”But that wasn’t for a lack of Trump trying.Trump repeatedly pressured the Justice Department as president to prosecute both Clinton and Biden, in addition totrying to get foreign countries to investigate Biden. That the Trump-era Justice Department declined to charge Clinton and Biden doesn’t mean it’s true that Trump didn’t “go after” them or others. (In fact, Trumpliterally saidin 2017 that he wanted the department to be “going after” Clinton.)John Kelly, whom Trump appointed as Secretary of Homeland Security and then White House chief of staff,told The New York Times in 2023of Trump: “He was always telling me that we need to use the FBI and IRS to go after people – it was constant and obsessive and is just what he’s claiming is being done to him now.”And contrary to Vance’s claim to Raddatz that Harris has herself tried to arrest political opponents, which Van Kirk echoed in her Monday statement to CNN, there is no public evidence that Harris pressured the Justice Department to prosecute Trump or her other opponents. The decision to bring two criminal cases against Trump – one over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and one over his post-presidency retention of classified documents – was made by a special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland.Trump made many public calls for investigations and prosecutions of political opponentsOn some occasions, Trump’s calls for investigations, arrests or prosecutions of his political opponentssoundedmore like vague gripesthan sincere attempts to prompt official action. On numerous occasions, though, Trump applied explicit, sustained public pressure on the Justice Department in general or his attorney general to pursue his opponents.For example, in 2017 and 2018, Trump frequently harangued then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions in tweets and public remarks to investigate various allegations against Clinton.“Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes,” hewrotein one tweet. “So where is the investigation A.G.,” hewrotein another tweet. “So many people are asking why isn’t the A.G. or Special Council (sic) looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes,” hewrotein another tweet. Inyet anothertweet, he noted allegations about Clinton, then wrote that “at some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper.”Trump made a directpublic requestin 2019 for Ukraine and China to launch investigations into Joe Biden and Hunter Biden – after he was already facing criticism forprivately pressuring Ukraine to investigate them. And in 2020, Trumppublicly demandedthat then-Attorney General William Barr indict Joe Biden, Obama and unspecified others over their supposed roles in the investigation into his 2016 campaign’s links to Russia.“Unless Bill Barr indicts these people for crimes, the greatest political crime in the history of our country, then we’re going to get little satisfaction unless I win and we’ll just have to go – because I won’t forget it. But these people should be indicted. This was the greatest political crime in the history of our country. And that includes Obama and it includes Biden,” Trumpsaid.Trump privately pressured the Justice DepartmentTrump suggested in that Fox News interview that he might have raised the subject of Biden and Obama indictments with Barr, saying, “I’ll be honest with you, he’s got all the information he needs. They want to get more, more, more, they keep getting more. I said, ‘You don’t need any more. You’ve got more stuff than anybody’s ever had.’”Trump privately pressured the Justice Department and Trump administration officials to go after other political opponents, according to former officials and news reports. And it appears he was sometimes successful, though it’s impossible to definitively prove a direct relationship between his demands and the department’s actions.Sessionstold special counsel Robert Muellerthat Trump pressured him in 2017 to abandon hisrecusalfrom investigations related to the 2016 election in order to prosecute Clinton, according to the Mueller report. Sessions did not do that, but heannounced in March 2018that he had (in November 2017) appointed a federal prosecutor to look into a variety of allegations against Clinton. She wasnever charged.The New York Timesreported this yearthat in April 2018, Trump told aides that if Sessions didn’t prosecute Clinton and Comey, Trump would prosecute them himself – prompting his White House counsel to write him a memo outlining the limits of the president’s powers.Boltonwrotein a 2020 book that Trump was “obsessed” with having Kerry prosecuted for supposedlybreaking a rarely enforced old lawbyremaining in contactwith Iranian officials after leaving office to try to preserve the nuclear agreement Kerry helped to negotiate. Bolton wrote that “in meeting after meeting in the Oval (Office), Trump would ask Attorney General William Barr or anybody listening to launch a prosecution.”The same week in 2018 that Trump tweeted that Kerry might have broken the law, the Justice Department assigned federal prosecutors to investigate Kerry,according to a bookby former federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman, who wasousted by Trump in 2020. Then, the same day Trump tweeted about Kerry in 2019, a Justice Department official called one of the prosecutors to apply more pressure over the case, Berman wrote. Kerry was never charged.In 2019, Barr satisfied Trump’s investigate-the-investigators demand bytaskinga federal prosecutor to help investigate the origins of the FBI’s probe related to Russia and the 2016 election. In late 2020, with about three months left in Trump’s presidency, Barr gave that prosecutor, John Durham,the status of special counsel.And in early 2020, Barrtaskeda different federal prosecutor with taking in information from members of the public,notably including then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, related to allegations about the Bidens and Ukraine, which had been a subject of Trump’s public and private focus.","Score: -1

cnn,Fact check: What Trump keeps getting wrong about ‘paper ballots’,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/fact-check-trump-paper-ballots/index.html,"WashingtonCNN—After losing the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump has championed the baseless lie that the results were tainted by widespread fraud.To fix this made-up problem, Trump has proposed a four-part solution: The US should switch exclusively to paper ballots, requireproof of citizenshipto register to vote, require voters to show ID at the polls, and eliminate mail-in voting by holding the entire election in-person on just one day.Policymakers can debate the merits of forcing voters to prove their citizenship and provide ID. And mail-in voting, widely used by both Democrats and Republicans, isn’t going anywhere.But Trump’s comments on “paper ballots” havepuzzled voting expertsand election officials – because almost all voters nationwide already use paper ballots.Facts First:Trump’s insistence that the US switch to “paper ballots” is nonsensical. More than 98% of voters live in jurisdictions that produce fully auditable paper trails, according todata from Verified Voting, which tracks election equipment in every county.Trump brings up his four-part proposal almost every time he speaks about election integrity. He has mentioned the “paper ballots” claimdozens of timesthis year alone.“We’re going to fix our elections so that our elections are going to be honorable and honest, and people leave, and they know their vote is counted,” Trump said at anAugust rallyin Potterville, Michigan. “We are going to have free and fair elections. And ideally, we go to paper ballots, same-day voting, proof of citizenship – very big – and voter ID.”In aninterviewlast month, Trump said one way to “solve this problem” of mass fraud was to “go to paper ballots.” At arallyin Johnstown, Pennsylvania, he said, “we want to go to paper ballots.” And hesaid, “we want paper ballots,” in Montezuma Pass, Arizona.Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group, has spent the past two decades urging counties to move away from paperless voting in favor of in-person polling sites. (Vote-by-mail obviously incorporates a paper trail.) The people who run the group say they have accomplished their goal – despite claims from Trump and others that the US still needs paper ballots.“It’s really weird and I don’t understand it,” said Mark Lindeman, the group’s director for policy and strategy. “Almost everybody votes on paper ballots. Anyone who is convinced that we need paper ballots is very likely voting on paper ballots themselves.”Only about 1.4% of registered voters live in counties where there’s no paper trail of their ballot if they vote in-person, according to Verified Voting’s data. (If they vote-by-mail, then there is a paper trail.) These holdouts are the entire state of Louisiana and a few Texas counties.For everyone else, there are paper trails that can be checked during a post-election audit or recount.Nearly 70% of registered voters live in counties where voters physically mark their choices on a paper ballot.Another 25% of voters live in counties that use “ballot-marking devices,” where voters use a touchscreen or another interface to select their candidates, and then the machine fills out a paper ballot to reflect their selections.The remaining 5% of voters use electronic machines that record votes directly into the computer’s memory. But even most of these machines now create paper trails, too. The holdout counties in Texas and the entire state of Louisiana only store the votes on the computer memory.The share of voters in “paperless” counties has been steadily shrinking with every election cycle over the past 20 years, according to Verified Voting.Sherry Poland, elections director in Hamilton County, Ohio, which includes Cincinnati, said her county switched to hand-marked paper ballots in 2006, and that the system creates a “backup” and “redundancy” that should inspire confidence in the integrity of the process.“The trend is coming back now and everyone is realizing the value of having a paper trial,” said Poland, a Republican.After the 2016 election, battleground states like Pennsylvania andGeorgiatransitioned away from paperless machines and now use systems with paper trails. And since 2020, Tennessee and many counties in New Jersey, Texas, and Mississippi made the switch too.False and nonsensical claims about election procedures have had a negative impact on voter perceptions on the integrity of US elections, especially among Republicans.A majority of Trump supporters in Michigan, Arizona, and Pennsylvania now say they’re “not at all confident” or only “just a little” confident the results will be accurately tallied in their state, according torecent CNN polling. And one in five of Trump supporters said in a recentABC/Ipsos pollthat they aren’t prepared to accept the results of the election.“Twenty years ago, Verified Voting was founded to get rid of paperless (voting machines),” Lindeman said.“And now we’ve just about made it. We’re wondering why everybody isn’t happier.We’ve done this incredible thing together as a country.”","Score: -1

Univision itself debunked that claim on Thursday night.Trump also made a false claim that he doesn’t use teleprompters himself. In reality, Trump regularly uses teleprompters for his speeches and, as usual, hadone visible to his left and one visible to his rightduring this very speech.Trumpsaidat the Friday rally in Aurora, Colorado: “Did you see where she did a town hall yesterday and she used a teleprompter? I never saw a town – they never – you don’t use teleprompters, we don’t use teleprompters, period, pretty much. You don’t use ‘em for town halls.”Facts First:Trump’s claims are both wrong. The moderator of the Univision town hall and the president of Univision News both refuted the claim that Harris used a teleprompter at the town hall, noting Thursday that the teleprompter that was seen on the broadcast had text in Spanish, not English, and that it was material for the moderator, not Harris. And Trump uses teleprompters for most of his speeches, though he also regularly ad-libs additional remarks.The false claim that Harris used a teleprompter at the town hall generated millions of views on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. It was made by several right-wing commentators with significant followings, includingBenny Johnson,Charlie Kirk,Greg Priceand Fox News host Sean Hannity.Univision News president Daniel Coronell, responding to Price’s claim that “Kamala is using a teleprompter during her ‘town hall’ with Univision,”wroteon X: “That’s not true. The teleprompter that displays a text written in Spanish was a support element for the town hall moderator. I can tell you this with first-hand knowledge because I was in charge of the television program.”Town hall moderator Enrique Acevedo, responding to Johnson’s claim that “Univision accidentally broadcast proof that Kamala used a teleprompter at her town hall,”wroteon X: “The prompter displayed my introduction (in Spanish) and then it switched to a timer. Any claim to the contrary is simply untrue.”Acevedo and Coronell both posted their debunkings late Thursday night, but the viral posts from Price, Johnson and Kirk remained online as of 4 p.m. on Friday; Hannity deleted his post. Price, Johnson and Kirk did not respond to CNN requests for comment on Friday.Trump has made teleprompter-related comments a staple of his recent criticism of Harris as he has insulted her intelligence. Last month, hefalsely claimedthat Harris used notes in a televised interview with CNN.The right-wing commentators’ inaccurate posts claiming Harris used a teleprompter at the Univision town hall relied on a 12-second clip that was posted Thursday by the Trump campaign’s “Trump War Room” account. The campaign did not make an explicit claim in itsown post; rather, it simply wrote, “The teleprompter” and added an emoji of big eyes.Its allies did the rest.","Score: -1

cnn,"In Colin Allred, Ted Cruz once again facing a well-funded Democratic challenger in reelection fight",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/texas-senate-race-ted-cruz/index.html,"Waxahachie, TexasCNN—On a sunny October afternoon, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz posed for photos with supporters next to his campaign bus in downtown Waxahachie – a historic square complete with quaint shops and a storied, almost mythical-looking courthouse.The city is the seat of conservative Ellis County, directly south of Dallas and named after one of the leaders who helped Texas declare its independence from Mexico in 1836. Cruz had just delivered a fiery speech in an old playhouse across the street called the Texas Theater, where he rallied the crowd with red-meat rhetoric and jokes appealing to the state’s unique sense of pride.“We were founded by a bunch of wildcatters,” he said onstage in jeans and boots. “A bunch of guys with fourth-grade educations who began drilling holes in the ground and one after the other became the richest men on Earth. That’s Texas! Texas is: Give me an open field and a horse and a gun, and I can conquer the world.”Ranked one of the most conservative senators, Cruz’s bid for a third term should be a smooth ride in a place that has consistently elected Republicans in statewide contests for the past 30 years. But for the second election in a row, Cruz finds himself fighting to keep his seat against a well-funded Democrat.Rep. Colin Allred is a former NFL linebacker and civil rights lawyer who ousted a Republican for a US House seat six years ago. He’s now challenging Cruz and painting the incumbent senator as an unlikeable politician who cares more about podcasting than about legislating.Florida Sen. Rick Scott, left, and Texas Sen. Ted CruzGetty ImagesRelated articleSenate Democrats launch first multimillion-dollar TV investments in Texas and Florida as map grows more dauntingRecent polls suggest a tightening race, one reminiscent of when Democrat Beto O’Rourke lost to Cruz in 2018 by less than 3 percentage points in a campaign that caught the country’s attention. National Democratic groups are again investing heavily in TV ads, stirring up an all-too-familiar hope they can pull off a massive upset, though many remain skeptical.Both men describe themselves as serious legislators who can work across the aisle, while at the same time, blast each other as radical candidates out of touch with Texas voters. The ad wars on TV further highlight a stark contrast between two emerging yet competing ideas of the Texas electorate – a longtime conservative force or an evolving landscape with increasingly Democratic strongholds.The latter of which is a reality casting a shadow on Cruz’s campaign – most notably when he urges voters on his 53-city tour to vote for Republicans up and down the ticket.“This race comes down to one very simple thing,” he says in his stump speech, “keeping Texas Texas.”The issues: Economy, the border and transgender policiesIn the final weeks before the election, both candidates are blitzing across the state to drill home their closing message. They’re also set to duel in a televised debate Tuesday,hosted by CNN affiliate WFAA.That’s on top of the massive amount of money spent on ads in the state’s abundant and expensive media markets. The two campaigns and their allied groups have spent nearly $129 million, including future ad buys through Election Day, according to data from AdImpact, making it one of the eight most expensive Senate races this cycle. Allred and groups supporting him have spent nearly two-thirds of that total, while Cruz and his supporters have spent the other third.Sen. Ted Cruz addresses supporters during a campaign event on October 5 in Keller, Texas.Julio Cortez/APCruz has largely aimed his attacks on Allred regarding three issues: the economy, the US southern border and transgender policies. He’s released multiple TV ads pointing to Allred’s vote against a GOP-led House bill last year that would have banned transgender athletes from women’s and girls’ sports at federally funded schools. The bill,which passed on a party-line vote, was not taken up by the Senate.On the campaign trail, Cruz makes the topic a prominent part of his stump speech. “We are living in a world where one of the two major parties right now cannot figure out what is a woman,” he said. “That didn’t use to be a trick question.”Allred became the first Democrat this election cycle to release an ad responding to the barbs over transgender issues – a key line of attack by Republicans in the presidential race and other congressional races.“Ted Cruz is lying again, but now he’s lying about our children. I’m a dad. I’m also a Christian,” Allred says in a new ad. “And my faith has taught me that all kids are God’s kids. So let me be clear: I don’t want boys playing girls sports or any of this ridiculous stuff that Ted Cruz is saying.”CNN has asked Allred’s campaign to clarify his stance more precisely but has not received a response.From left, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Lori Chavez-DeRemerThe Washington Post/Getty ImagesRelated articleTwo House incumbents seek to woo the other party’s voters in Pacific Northwest swing seatsCruz also criticizes Allred for changing his tune on the southern border. While running for Congress in 2018, Allredreferred to the border wall as “racist,”and as recently as two years ago said he didn’t see the border as a “top-of-mind” issue for a lot of voters in Texas, though he said he wanted to see comprehensive immigration reform.He’s now making the border a focal point in his ads, vowing to fix the issue and attacking Cruz for opposing the bipartisan immigration bill earlier this year. Allred also joined with Republicans this year to condemn the “Biden administration’s open-borders policies” in a GOP-led resolution.On the campaign trail, where the border is a winning issue for Republicans, Cruz has repeatedly called out Allred for standing in front of the same border wall that the representative criticized years ago in one of his TV ads and has questioned Allred’s seriousness about the border.In an interview with CNN, Allred defended his position, acknowledging that he and his party took “too long to be responsive to what was a rising tide of migration.”“But we can also say the response can’t be ‘Let’s be cruel to people and think that’s gonna help.’ That’s not actual border security,” he said.Meanwhile, Allred is hitting Cruz hard over abortion, arguing the senator is “responsible” for the overturning of Roe v. Wade by helping put judges and justices in federal courts, leading to the landmark decision by the Supreme Court in 2022.“With Ted Cruz, we get more government and less freedom, and Texas women pay the price,” the narrator says in one of Allred’s ads.While Cruz has celebrated the Supreme Court ruling as a major victory, he’s remained quiet recently about his stance on Texas’abortion laws, which don’t include exceptions for rape or incest. Asked by CNN why he didn’t mention abortion in his stump speech after a rally in Allen, Cruz argued it’s not a top concern for Texas voters and changed the subject to jobs and the border. In another gaggle with reporters the following day, he said it was an issue for state leaders to decide.‘Republicans for Allred’Both candidates tout their bipartisanship, but Allred is leaning heavily into his support from high-profile Republicans such as former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who leads a group called “Republicans for Allred.”Allred brings up their endorsements often, mentioning their names more frequently than Vice President Kamala Harris’. Asked by CNN about that strategy, Allred said he doesn’t think Texas voters view his race and the presidential race in the same light.Rep. Colin Allred speaks during a campaign event that saw volunteers man phones on October 3, in San Antonio, Texas.Brandon Bell/Getty Images“I do think that there are Texans out there who are actual conservatives and who believe in the rule of law, who believe in the Constitution, who believe we shouldn’t try and overturn elections, who think that, you know, they don’t want to be embarrassed anymore by their senator,” he said.Cruz finds Cheney’s support laughable. “I’ve known Liz Cheney a long time, and she’s completely lost her mind,” he told CNN when asked about her endorsement.Allred’s effort to cement his brand as a moderate is one key difference from O’Rourke’s campaign in 2018. And while O’Rourke crisscrossed the state with large, energetic rallies, Allred has spent much of the race holding smaller, more intimate events, while spending big – and early – on TV ads to boost his name recognition. In these final weeks, Allred is starting to do bigger events, urging people to get out the vote.O’Rourke also refrained from going negative against Cruz, but Allred isn’t holding back punches. Several of his ads show video of Cruz at the airport on his infamous trip to Cancun during the deadly 2021 Texas freeze that left the state in a standstill for days. Cruz called the trip amistake when he returned, but he has since joked about it.At a campaign event last week with the “Funky East Dallas Democrats,” Allred railed against Cruz’s intentions as a serious legislator, poking fun at his thrice-weekly podcast, blaming him in part for the January 6, 2021, insurrection, and knocking him on abortion.But in his closing line, Allred asked the crowd to remember Cruz’s Cancun suitcase as they watch the results come in on Election Day.“Imagine Cruz taking that same little roller bag and walking right out of the Capitol,” he said.CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report.","Score: 0

cnn,House Republicans attempt to avoid 2022 letdown with new tactic on abortion: ‘We’re both pro-choice’,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/house-republicans-abortion-strategy-elections/index.html,"For more on the House Republican strategy on abortion issues, watch CNN’s “Inside Politics with Manu Raju,” this Sunday at 8 a.m. ET.﻿WashingtonCNN—Republicans in the nation’s toughest House districts are making a major pivot on abortion with a surprising result — they’re starting to sound like Democrats.GOP candidates in suburbs of places like Tucson, Des Moines and Syracuse are going public with vows never to criminalize abortion or support a national ban. Some are going further: Rep.John Duarteof California’s Central Valley, Rep. Tom Kean Jr. in northern New Jersey and GOP candidate Matt Gunderson in the San Diego area have all described themselves as “pro choice” — with the latter even speaking directly to camera in his first TV ad and borrowing Bill Clinton’s phrase calling for the procedure to be “safe, legal and rare.”In this fall’s toss-up battle for the House, swing-seat Republicans are carefully rebranding themselves on abortion after largely failing to respond to relentless Democratic attacks that cost the GOP big last cycle. And they’re attempting to neutralize the Democrats’ most potent attack — all in an effort to turn voters’ attention to the US-Mexico border and other galvanizing issues.“Since we’re both pro-choice, then we have an opportunity to take that conversation, set it aside and have a real serious conversation about solving the border, about inflation, the economy, jobs, crime, education,” Gunderson said in an interview, referring to his opponent, Democratic Rep. Mike Levin.It may be easier said than done.Even as swing-seat Republicans attempt to paint a more nuanced view of the GOP’s stance on abortion, the national party has often muddled that message. In recent days, former first lady Melania Trump disclosed she supports the right to an abortion “free from any intervention” — while Donald Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, took the staunchly conservative position of vowing to defund Planned Parenthood.And it all underscores a critical weakness for the GOP fewer than 30 days from the election. The party still struggles to respond to an issue that makes up the vast majority of Democratic attacks this cycle: 80% of spending on TV ads by the House Democrats’ two main groups went to ads focusing on abortion. And it’s been particularly effective against GOP incumbents with well-documented comments on abortion — like Rep. Zach Nunn of Iowa — that Democrats have turned into attack ads.“You can’t hide from it,” said Rep. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican from North Dakota, reflecting on the lessons Republicans learned in the 2022 midterms. “We didn’t really have a plan for what had happened.”Democrats say their foes’ efforts to show a softer side on abortion won’t work.“He’s going to probably say anything he needs to say to try to win and see what sticks,” Levin, a three-term Democrat who cut an ad responding to Gunderson, told CNN.“We know that if Mike Johnson is empowered, that there are many around here that would try to get a national abortion ban in place,” Levin said, even as his opponent said he’d oppose both a national ban and a bill to codify Roe, saying the issue should be left up to the states.Behind closed doors, Republican leaders have spent months working with battleground candidates, particularly in New York and California, to sell a more moderate message on the issue. The House GOP campaign chief, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, has advised fellow Republicans to clearly articulate their views — or face globs of Democratic spending to distort their position.And they’ve been far more aggressive in calling out some misleading Democratic ads, which have accused Republican candidates of supporting strict abortion bans or opposing exceptions for abortion even when that candidate is on the record with a more moderate position. In some cases, like in pivotal seats inNorth CarolinaandVirginia, fact-checkers have agreed.Hudson accused Democrats of “creating a false and distorted impression” of the GOP’s abortion position in the 2022 midterms and attacked Democrats for espousing their own “extreme” views on the issue.“To fight back, we have encouraged our candidates to be open, direct and empathetic about their position – and nonpartisan fact-checkers have responded, picking apart a litany of Democratic attack ads for telling blatant lies,” Hudson told CNN.Sarah Chamberlain, who runs the centrist-leaning Republican Mainstreet Partnership, recalled warning a prominent GOP pollster the day of the Dobbs Supreme Court decision that it would be a huge issue for women voters. He initially told her she was wrong, but phoned her after the midterms to admit his miscalculation. Since then, Chamberlain has used her own polling to help convince key swing-seat House Republicans to shift their approach.“Don’t use the ‘A word.’ Talk about it as women’s health care,” Chamberlain said. “The economy, immigration — there’s tons of things we can win on and should win on. But this issue is still very strong.”Democrats cry hypocrisyIn some cases, Republicans are trying to walk back — or completely abandon — their past anti-abortion rights views.When he first ran for Congress in 2022 for a seat in Washington state, GOP candidate Joe Kenttold a local news station: “I would move to have a national ban on abortion.”This time, Kentfilmed an adstating: “I oppose any new federal legislation on the issue.”Kent’s opponent — Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez — called out his shifting position in a recentcandidate debate, accusing him of playing “both sides of this card” and saying “what the pollsters tell him to say.”And he’s not the only one whose public position has changed. Nunn, the endangered Republican in Iowa, is fighting for his political survival as Democrats devote a majority of their TV ads to the issue in this suburban battleground.Nunn’s Democratic opponent, Lanon Baccam, hasattacked the GOP incumbentwith a clip from the Republican primary debate in 2022 when Nunn raised his hand to say all abortions should be illegal in the country. Nunn has not responded to the issue of abortion on air.And in the key California race to hold Levin’s seat, the main Democratic super PAC — House Majority PAC — has reserved $1.5 million to begin next week in an effort to target Gunderson. Abortion attacks are expected to be part of the mix.Levin has seized on Gunderson’s opposition to a 2022 California abortion rights referendum, which the Republican previously referred to as “disgusting” in a meeting with voters.“What I did say was that late-term abortion is disgusting,” Gunderson told CNN when asked about those remarks, arguing the referendum “opened up a Pandora’s box to late-term abortion.”Democratic leaders say Republicans are trying to muddy the waters.“This is a desperation move by Republicans,” said House Democrats’ campaign chief, Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state. “People know where they stand.”Pro-women language but unclear on specificsIn 2022, Democrats dumped a half-billion dollars’ worth of abortion attacks into pivotal races and helped prevent a GOP wave. This time, Republicans, like freshman Rep. Marc Molinaro, who is defending a tough upstate New York seat, are looking to take that issue off the table for Democrats.Molinaro was one of the first Republicans this cycle to launch a TV ad devoted solely to his stance on abortion.“I believe in supporting all women and the choices they make,” Molinaro says, speaking into the camera, in the ad.But even as he has sought to counter Democratic attacks, he hasn’t been entirely clear on what positions he does support. While the New York Republican touted support for “broad access” to birth control and blocking efforts to ban mifepristone in an interview, he didn’t offer a clear answer when asked if he supports restoring Roe or if he considers himself “pro choice.”“I describe it as somebody who says that the decision and the choice on reproductive health is between you and your physician. Immaterial of anything else, that’s what I believe,” Molinaro told CNN. As for his decision to speak up on abortion, Molinaro added: “I think it’s important that people see me explain to them that I respect the choice they make and that they have my support.”He isn’t the only Republican looking to keep their distance from the Dobbs decision.Duarte, the vulnerable California Republican, refused to say if he supports the 2022 decision that struck down Roe.“It doesn’t matter. It’s done. It’s in the rearview mirror,” Duarte told CNN. “And the fact is that abortion is back in the states where it belongs.”And the congressman contended that his position — and Trump’s position — that the matter should be left up to the states is effectively pro-abortion rights.“I am pro-choice,” Duarte said, arguing that Trump is even “functionally pro-choice,” though the former president regularly boasts about appointing three Supreme Court justices who struck down Roe and plans to vote against a Florida abortion rights referendum this fall.Another battleground Republican, Rep. Juan Ciscomani of southern Arizona, went up with his own TV ad this fall saying he opposes a federal abortion ban and supports abortion in the cases of certain exceptions, such as protecting the life of the mother.In adebatethis week, Ciscomani added that he also opposed his state’s Civil War-era ban on nearly all abortions, which was recently repealed. But he didn’t say how he’ll vote this November on his state’s ballot measure to enshrine rights to an abortion up to the point of viability, saying only that it was a state issue.And when asked about what he was trying to sell to voters with his ad, Ciscomani simply said: “My position.”","Score: 0

cnn,Trump spread conspiracies on mail-in voting for years. Now his campaign is urging people to vote early and by mail,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/trump-mail-in-voting/index.html,"CNN—Donald Trump’s campaign is making a last-minute push to advocate for early and mail-in voting, methods the former president has falsely vilified for years as dangerous and fraudulent.With less than a month to go in a tight race, Trump’s campaign is urging people to vote early and by mail, while also working to expandvoting access in North Carolinaafter Hurricane Helene.In a series of recent virtual town halls and robocalls reviewed by CNN, Trump and his daughter-in-law Lara Trump, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee, have actively encouraged voters to take advantage of early voting options, including mail-in ballots.“Hi, this is Lara Trump calling on behalf of President Trump’s campaign, and we’re urging you to get out and vote before Election Day,”one robocallsays. Earlier this year, LaraTrump voiced a robocallfalsely alleging massive fraud in the 2020 election due to mail-in ballots.The Trump campaign taps Lara Trump to encourage voters to vote early and by mailEarlier this year, the RNC co-chair voiced a robocall falsely alleging massive fraud occurred in the 2020 election due to mail ballots.Source: NomoroboAt least 286,000 estimated robocalls with this recording were sent to voters, including in the key swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada and Michigan, according to data fromNomorobo, an app that blocks and tracks robocalls. The calls began as early as October 2.The Trump campaign this past week also asked North Carolina to take steps to expand voting access in the wake of damage from Hurricane Helene – even asRepublicans in Georgia opposed an effortto expand voting access by extending registration deadlines following hurricane damage in that state.Lara Trump, daughter-in-law of former President Donald Trump, speaks at the Republican National Committee spring meeting on March 8, 2024, in Houston.Cecile Clocheret/AFP/Getty ImagesVoting rights advocates, while happy to see the Trump campaign join in a bipartisan push for expanded voting access, note that it cuts against a lengthy record of trying to restrict voting in this election and in 2020, when the pandemic upended voting across the country.“It’s great that the Trump campaign was speaking with the same voice as so many others and asking for expansions to voting access in the wake of Hurricane Helene,” said Sean Morales-Doyle, the director of the voting rights program at the Brennan Center for Justice. “But it does trouble me that they don’t take a sort of uniform approach to that – or to mail voting or to early voting.”In 2020, the Trump campaign filed several lawsuits to stop many of the changes made by states to make it easier to vote by mail. The changes were put in place to reduce indoor gatherings during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.“When you see this flip-flopping on voting, not only does it raise the concern that these policies are based on the politics of who they think will benefit from expanded access … it also makes clear that they know they’re not telling the truth on how expanded access from mail voting or early voting contribute to a denigration of election integrity,” Morales-Doyle added.North Carolina is one of the key swing states that could decide the presidential election, and the western part of the stateaffected most by the hurricaneis some of the most solid territory for Trump.Of the 25 counties in North Carolina’s federally declared disaster area, the former president won all but two in 2020, with nearly 63% of the vote. According to the state’s board of elections, there are 481,000 registered Republicans in the 25 counties, compared with 293,000 Democrats.Trump campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement that the proposals to expand voting access in North Carolina “will ensure the people who have already suffered from the storm don’t lose their right to participate in this important election.”“Swift action from the North Carolina General Assembly and the Governor will ensure the people of their state have their voices heard on November 5th,” they said.‘Too big to rig’Trump has previouslyreleased videosand messageson his social mediapromoting early and mail-in voting as part of the Republican National Committee’s get-out-the-vote program. Both methods of voting are promoted at Trump’s campaign rallies.But that push has at times led to conflicting messaging from the former president.Last month, at a rally inIndiana, Pennsylvania, Trump disparaged early voting, and promoted it, in the same breath.“We got to get out and vote. And you can start right away. You know that, right? Now we have this stupid stuff where you can vote 45 days early. I wonder what the hell happens during that 45. ‘Let’s move, see these votes? We’ve got about a million votes in there. Let’s move them. We’re fixing the air conditioner in the room, right?’ No, it’s terrible,” Trump said. “What happened the last time was disgraceful, including right here. But we’re not going to let it happen again. You know, too big to rig, right? That’s one way you do it.”In 2020, Trump called mail-in ballots “dangerous” and “corrupt.” Hesaid they’dlead to “massive electoral fraud” and a “rigged” 2020 election.Now locked in a tight election against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s campaign is actively promoting early in-person and mail voting, even as the former president pledged to one day eliminate the commonly used practices. He falsely implied they were insecure voting methods in a Junevideo posted to Swamp the Vote USA, a voting resource website paid for by the Republican National Committee.Former President Donald Trump speaks at the Detroit Economic Club on October 10, 2024.Bill Pugliano/Getty Images“I will once and for all secure our elections. We’re going to go to paper ballots. We’re going to have same-day voting, voter ID. We’re going to do it properly. We’re going to have good, secure, beautiful elections. We never want what happened in 2020 to happen again,” Trump says directly to the camera. “But until then, Republicans must win. And we must use every appropriate tool available to beat the Democrats. … Whether you vote early, absentee, by mail or in person, we’re going to protect the vote.”The Republican parties in Arizona and Nevada also tapped Lara Trump to voice robocalls promoting early and mail voting, despite previously echoing her father-in-law’s rhetoric on early voting.“With your help, we’re going to secure a massive victory in Nevada,” Lara Trump says on the Nevada robocall. “So, get out there, encourage others to vote early and remind them just how critical this election is. When we vote, we win.”Lara Trump encourages Nevada voters to vote early and by mailThe Nevada Republican Party tapped Lara Trump to encourage Nevadans to vote early and by mail.Source: NomoroboIn April,CNN’s KFile reportedLara Trump sent out a scripted call to voters’ phones saying Democrats committed “massive fraud” in the 2020 election.“We all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and noncitizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,”the RNC call from April said. “If Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn’t even an American citizen.”Pushing North Carolina to expand accessOn Tuesday, the Trump campaign issued astatement proposing 10 policy changesfor North Carolina to help voters in areas hit by Hurricane Helene, some of which were enacted by the state legislature.The Republican-led legislature’s bill, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper on Thursday, gave the 25 counties in the federally declared disaster area additional flexibility to run their elections. The law contains provisions similar to several of Trump’s proposals, including giving counties more flexibility on early voting hours and allowing counties to use temporary voting locations if precincts are unusable.Destroyed homes are seen in Chimney Rock, North Carolina, on October 2, 2024, after the passage of Hurricane Helene.Allison Joyce/AFP/Getty Images“I will give the Republicans who are in charge here credit for passing good legislation (Wednesday) that definitely will address needs of voters,” said Bob Phillips, the executive director of Common Cause North Carolina, a group that advocates for expanded voter access. “The biggest thing is giving each of these county board of elections the flexibility with regards to voting sites, both for early voting and Election Day.”The Trump campaign also proposed expanding bipartisan teams to help voters request and deliver absentee ballots to county boards and allowing voters displaced to other counties in the state to cast provisional ballots that would be delivered back to their home county.In Georgia, however,where Helene also caused significant damage, Republicans opposed an attempt to expand voter access. The Republican National Committee intervened as a defendant in a lawsuit brought by civil rights groups to extend the county’s voter registration deadline, which was Monday.A federal judge on Thursdaydenied that motion, saying it “lacked clarity and detail” as to how specific individuals were harmed.A similar lawsuit over the voter registration deadline in Florida – which is still determining the damage inflicted byHurricane Milton– was also dismissed by a federal judge on Wednesday.An RNC spokesperson said liberal groups in Georgia were trying to use the courts to extend registration deadlines enacted by the legislature, when voters have had months to register to vote in Georgia.“As many Americans are still reeling from the impact of Hurricane Helene, the Trump Campaign and RNC are fighting to expand voting access for those displaced, and we are meeting voters where they are to ensure they are educated on voting changes,” said RNC spokesperson Anna Kelly.Trump and his allies have argued there’s a difference in changes approved by a legislature – like the campaign asked North Carolina to do – and many of the changes that were made in 2020 by election boards during the pandemic.Voting rights advocates say while the circumstances are different between a pandemic and a hurricane, the idea of allowing displaced voters to participate in an election should be the same.“Even to the extent these disasters cause different hurdles, the policy solutions are often the same,” said Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center. “Expanded access is key, and in order to expand access, funding is key. The things we’re advocating for right now in North Carolina and Florida, in many ways, echo the things we were advocating for in 2020.”","Score: -1

cnn,Postmaster general says ballots should be mailed in at least a week before Election Day,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/post-office-mail-in-voting-dejoy/index.html,"CNN—Postmaster General Louis DeJoy pledged Thursday that the US Postal Service will undertake “heroic efforts” to deliver all mail-in ballots on time this year and urged people to put their ballots in the mail at least one week before Election Day on November 5.“Let me be clear, the Postal Service is ready to deliver the nation’s mail-in ballots,” DeJoy said at a news conference, held as a bipartisan group of election officials recently raised concerns about the delivery of mail ballots and former President Donald Trump repeats some of his debunked false claims about supposed fraud with mail-in voting.“We encourage the voting public to mail early if they chose to vote by mail,” he said.USPS will work “around the clock” and implement “extraordinary measures” to ensure the timely delivery of mail-in voting, DeJoy said. Arecord43% of voters cast mail ballots in 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic. The level isn’t expected to be as high this year, but many states across the country haveexpandedthe availability of mail-in voting.These special measures include designated lines at post offices for people with ballots, extra deliveries and collections by letter-carriers, “after-hours” drop-offs to election offices, and keeping processing facilities open on the Sunday before Election Day.The postmaster general tiptoed around a question from CNN about Trump’s recent social media post, implicitly rebuking the former president without mentioning his name.“My response is like my response to everyone who says we’re not prepared for the election – it is that they’re wrong,” DeJoy said. “I don’t know that I need to comment any more than that. They’re wrong.”“For a variety of reasons, there is a heightened sensitivity and scrutiny across the entire vote-by-mail ecosystem,” DeJoy also said. “…The American public will become increasingly alarmed if there is ongoing dialogue that continues to question the reliability of the Postal Service for the upcoming elections.”Lyingaboutmail-in votingwas acenterpieceof Trump’s 2020 campaign, and as the 2024 race reaches the final stretch, he hasresurrectedmany of thesefalse claims.In a social media post on Sunday, Trump claimed without evidence that USPS “admitted that it is a poorly run mess.” And Trump claimed in a recent interview with a right-wing radio host that USPS will “lose hundreds of thousands of ballots, maybe purposely.”Despite Trump’s claims, voter fraud is extremely rare in US elections, according to studies from liberal and conservative groups, and the expansion of mail-in voting doesn’t automatically benefit Democrats over Republicans. But since 2020, Trump’sincessant attackson the practice hasmade it much less popularamong GOP voters.The USPSsaysduring the 2020 election, which was conducted amid the Covid-19 pandemic, it delivered nearly 99% of ballots from voters to election officials within seven days. DeJoy has said “we take great pride” in how USPS handled the 2020 election, whenthereweremajorcontroversiesandlawsuitsregarding delivery of mail-in ballots.DeJoy becamepostmaster general in June 2020after being selected by the USPS Board of Governors. All six members of the bipartisan board were appointed by Trump.Engaging with local officialsThe National Association of Secretaries of State, an umbrella organization that represents election officials from both parties, started raising alarm bells earlier this month when it senta letterto DeJoy expressing “ongoing concerns” about the postal service’s “ability to deliver election mail in a timely and accurate manner” this year.Specifically, the election officials said they’ve experienced “exceptionally long delivery times” for election mail, including ballots, which could lead to those ballots getting rejected because they didn’t arrive before the deadline. They also wrote that they’ve noticed “higher than usual rates” of election-related mail being marked as undeliverable.“Despite repeated engagement” with USPS officials who handle election mail, “we have not seen improvement or concerted efforts to remediate our concerns,” the letter said.DeJoy said Thursday he is a “pretty accessible executive” and would step up coordination with the election officials during the final stretch of the campaign.“I have agreed to stay more in contact with them,” DeJoy said, regarding the National Association of Secretaries of State. “I procedurally directed our regional team to be more integrated into meeting with our operational teams as we move forward, so we can more rapidly respond to issues as we get the specifics of those issues.”","Score: -1

cnn,"Arizona Supreme Court rules voters caught in proof-of-citizenship glitch can still get ‘full ballot,’ including state races",https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/politics/arizona-supreme-court-citizenship-voting/index.html,"CNN—The Arizona Supreme Court ruled Friday that nearly 100,000 residentswho may not have fulfilled the state’s proof-of-citizenship requirementscan still vote in state and local races this year, quickly resolving how election officials should address a clerical glitch that had left in question the eligibility of those registered voters in  the critical battleground state.The court was asked to decide whether these voters should get a “federal-only” ballot or the “full ballot,” which would also include state and local races. Regardless of the outcome, these voters would have been able to cast presidential ballots.Arizona uses these separate ballots because the state requires all voters to prove their citizenship before they can vote in state and local races. Such documentation isn’t required to cast ballots for federal office in Arizona.The decision to let these roughly 98,000 voters use the full ballot is a victory for Arizona’s Democratic secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, and liberal groups that pushed for this outcome.The Arizona Supreme Court ruled just three days after the lawsuit was filed. Election officials hoped a quick resolution of the issue would reduce confusion heading into voting season.Besides state and local races, the ruling could also affect Arizona’sreferendumon abortion rights this fall.Maricopa County RecorderStephen Richer, a Republican, filed the lawsuit Tuesday against Fontes, arguing that the nearly 98,000 voters should receive the federal-only ballot. But Richer had said his bigger priority was getting speedy clarity from the courts.“Thank God,” Richerpostedon social media in response to Friday’s ruling. “Thank you Arizona Supreme Court for your extremely quick and professional review of this matter.”In a show of bipartisanship, Richer and Fontes thanked each other for collaboratively tackling the unexpected pre-election issue. Fontes said election officials would work to fix the clerical error after the election, including outreach to the affected voters asking them to update their citizenship records.“Today marks a significant victory for those whose fundamental right to vote was under scrutiny,” Fontes said. “The court faced a stark choice: to allow voters to participate in just a few federal races on a limited ballot, or to make their voices heard across hundreds of decisions on a full ballot that includes a variety of local and state offices. We deeply appreciate the Arizona Supreme Court for their prompt and just resolution.”Arizona officials previously said a glitch miscategorized nearly 98,000 people in the state’s voter rolls as having provided proof of citizenship – even though there is no record of that happening. Those voters got their driver’s license before 1996, which is the year Arizona started requiring residents to prove their citizenship to obtain a license.Former President Donald Trump and hisRepublican allieshave raisedbaselessclaims thatmassive numbersof noncitizens have voted in US elections, and Trump used this case to continue his yearslong pattern of using routine mishaps and errors in the voting process to allege widespread fraud.

cnn,Biden’s clean energy law revived this red corner of Georgia. Voters there are backing Trump anyway,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/27/politics/dalton-georgia-trump-voters-biden-climate-law/index.html,"Dalton, GeorgiaCNN—Theface of a new erain American manufacturing is here, just off Interstate 75, tucked into this northwest corner of Georgia.That’s where you’ll find the Qcells plant that pumps out 32,000 solar panels a day and has a total panel production capacity of 5.1 gigawatts. For context, officials note, the peak capacity of the Hoover Dam is roughly 2 gigawatts.“When I came here, there was dirt. There was no building,” said Lisa Nash, the plant manager here, walking CNN through the high-tech factory floor in August. “I was the first person hired.”Asked if she could have envisioned where things are now, she didn’t hesitate: “No.”In Nash’s view, the dramatic growth isn’t just a success story for the company or industry, it’s also major win for the community here in Dalton.“The population’s growing. They’re buying houses, rent, shopping, eating out. They’re contributing back into the local community, paying taxes,” Nash said.It’s a cutting-edge operation that was made possible by thesweeping climate investment lawenacted by the Biden administration in 2022.“We’ve had lots of support in the state and federal level of various kinds,” said Scott Moskowitz, the head of market strategy and public affairs at Qcells. “But it wasn’t till the Inflation Reduction Act passed, which really provided the spark that this industry needed to make these types of investments.”Vice President Kamala Harris visits the Qcells solar panel manufacturing plant in Dalton, Georgia, on April 6, 2023.Andi Rice/CNP//Bloomberg/Getty Images/FileWhich is why Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to the plant last year to highlight its growth – and speak to some of its employees.“To meet her and to have a conversation with her, I was shocked because I was thinking, you know, she’s up here, but she’s actually down to earth, very straightforward,” said Kimberly Richardson, the Qcells employee selected by management to introduce Harris during her visit.A view of the Ultium Cell factory in Warren, Ohio, July 7, 2023.Gene J. Puskar/AP/FileRelated articleAn EV plant bolstered by Biden’s climate law sparks hope in Northeast Ohio – but not a revival of its Democratic rootsRichardson embodies a new generation of manufacturing workers – someone with no experience in solar panels or the green technology space prior to joining Qcells who has quickly acclimated – and risen – inside the company, where she’s now in charge of the plant’s recycling operation.For Richardson, a Black woman, Harris’ campaign for president carries a deep meaning.“She represents every woman in the United States, every woman,” Richardson said. “She set the tone for every woman in the United States, every little girl, to say, ‘I can do this,’ and that’s a good thing.”But while Georgia may be a hotly contested battleground state, Richardson’s view isn’t exactly widespread here, where support for formerPresident Donald Trumpruns strong.“She wasn’t well received in north Georgia,” Kasey Carpenter, the Republican state representative for the area, said of the Harris visit.The Qcells plant offers a window into the convergence of local, state and federal government aligning to accelerate a manufacturing transition that has turbocharged a local economy. That the effort has crossed party lines is rare enough in these polarized times.But that it happened in a community that backs a presidential candidate who has attacked the very law that is central to its rapid expansion underscores the complex – and in this case, contradictory - overlap of politics and a local economy.The Qcells solar panel plant in Dalton, GeorgiaCNNTrump strikes a chordLocated in the congressional district represented by GOP firebrandMarjorie Taylor Greene, Dalton is Trump country.“The independence that we keep up here – it’s that independence and outsider that he’s really struck a chord with,” Carpenter said of Trump’s rock-solid support in the area. “And my folks, they appreciate that. And quite frankly that I appreciate that too.”Carpenter is far from a die-hard Trump supporter.“We’re in a world where we get two candidates, but we have 27 boxes of cereal on the shelf. That’s the world I live in,” he said. “It’s that frustrating that you have two candidates.”But for voters here, the political debate over the economy comes down to one thing.“Inflation is such a big issue for our community right now that that’s going to trump anything that kind of I think about,” Carpenter said.George state Rep. Kasey CarpenterCNNThis is the paradox playing out during a dramatic comeback for this part of the state.The Qcells plant – the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere – sits in what has long been known as the carpet capital of the world.The moniker can be found on the signs welcoming visitors to Dalton, which has held a dominant market share of the carpet and flooring industry for decades.But it also left the area particular vulnerable to something most thought was impossible until 2008: a housing market crash.“It was a bloodbath for us here,” Carpenter said. “It was a ghost town. And it took us years to get out of it.”The market collapse sparked local leaders to start thinking through – and setting up the infrastructure for – the diversification of the town’s economy.That overlapped with efforts at the state level – most recently by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp – to line up incentives for major companies to relocate to or build in Georgia.The Biden administration’s incentives from the federal side turbocharged the efforts on green energy.“They are all equally important,” Nash said when asked whose support was most critical between federal, state and local government. “It’s like a recipe and without one ingredient, you can’t successfully have this project.”The result has been the revival of a model that was thought to be a thing of the past.“If you walk around in the factory, you’re going see a broad age band,” Nash said. “We have a 65-year-old father. His son and his daughter work here. There are high school students that we interview because of their gaming.”What was once aspirational is now reality – and growing.‘A hometown feel’Just about 50 miles down I-75 is Cartersville, where on a recent Saturday the center of town was jam-packed with residents stopping through booths filled by local vendors selling locally sourced food and agricultural goods.For two years running, this has been ranked the top farmer’s market in Georgia, which might not be expected in a county that voted 75% for Trump in 2020.Cartersville, Georgia, Mayor Matt Santini talks with CNN's Phil Mattingly at the town's farmer's market.CNNBut in some ways, it’s a key element to an approach that helped the town lure Qcells to build its next plant here, just a few miles away from where CNN linked up with its mayor, Matt Santini.This is clearly a Republican town, with deep-rooted support for the former president. But in Santini’s mind, the true nature of the place is the community itself.“It’s doubled in size since I moved here in the early ‘90s, but it’s still a place where, again, you can walk through a farmer’s market,” Santini said. “You see people talking and getting along with each other. We have a hometown feel.”CNNvideoRelated videoPoll shows Trump has edge with voters on this key issueBack in Dalton, that hometown feel is exactly the vibe a visitor gets walking into the Oakwood Cafe.The restaurant is technically the day job for Carpenter, the state legislator – and one that keeps him connected to the community he represents while in Atlanta when the Legislature is in session.“I’m real connected,” Carpenter said with a chuckle. “I fry their chicken on Monday, and Saturdays I’m washing their dishes.”Carpenter describes his community and its residents with pride.“It’s blue-collar, man. We’re all workers,” he said.But he acknowledges there’s a heavy dose of ideological irony in the economic engine that has taken root in the area over the past few years.“We’re growing the green energy that they don’t necessarily care that much about,” he said. “But I think they’re coming around because they see the impact on the economy.”That impact, he notes, has been significant.“Whether it’s janitorial, whether it’s restaurants, catering, whether it’s, you know, plastics, you know, garbage bags, whatever, shipping goods, all of that stuff flows downstream from something like that,” Carpenter said.An aerial view of Dalton, GeorgiaCNNThreats that haven’t resonatedThat downstream effect – perhaps most tangible in the form of downtown Dalton’s new boutique hotel, right across the street from the Oakwood Cafe, the area’s first in 50 years and evidence to many of the city’s comeback.Still, the campaign-trail threats from Trump to repeal pillars of the climate law that sparked the growth haven’t moved voters here – or really resonated.“I don’t think they realize that if the whole thing is repealed, it will affect those 2,500 jobs down on the south end of the county. And it’s real,” Carpenter said. “It will have consequences.”Qcells representatives are quick to point out that they first broke ground in Dalton in 2018 because Trump’s tariffs on solar panels incentivized production stateside.Still, the former president’s threats are impossible to ignore, even if the bipartisan support for the project across the federal, state and local levels offers it a level of protection should Trump win.“You want to ask me that after November?” Nash, the Qcells plant manager, responded when asked about the future for the industry.Lisa Nash, the Qcells plant manager, speaks with Mattingly.CNNBut she underscored the scale of the transformation already underway – and what that means for the future.“No, I’m optimistic because we’re just scratching the surface,” she said.It’s a future Nash’s parents thought didn’t exist.“Both of them said, ‘Don’t go into manufacturing,’” she recalled. “I’d like to think they’re both proud of me today because of this. I look at my kids and my grandkids, and I’m thinking: ‘I wouldn’t mind them doing that.’”It’s a window into a transformation that has taken hold of an entire community – a one-industry town no more.Asked if there were any plans to add “Solar capital of the world” onto the current Dalton signs in town, Carpenter thought about it for a minute.“No, but we should, though,” he said. “We’ve gotta wait and see what happens. Right now, the story still remains.”","Score: -1

Amazing,” Kerner recounted, inviting the obvious follow-up.So what happened to that street in Erie?“It’s pretty decimated now,” says the tool and die maker.Two of the most important battleground counties in two of the mostimportant battleground states.President Barack Obama won both handily on his path to reelection in 2012.Donald Trumpnarrowly captured each on his way to collapsing the Democrats’ vaunted “blue wall” in 2016.Joe Bidengrabbed them back four years later – by the narrowest of margins.The closely watched political bellwethers share a familiar economic backdrop, animated by their collapse as great hubs in American manufacturing when globalization sucked the life out of industrial powerhouses in this part of the country.It’s the throughline between the story as told by two families – the Colemans and the Kerners – with generational ties to these communities now fully ensconced in the political Klieg lights.They share a common passion for where they grew up and continue to reside today. With that comes a significant dose of hope that those places can regain some form of the economic success that defined their past.“Many of the matriarchs and patriarchs of our families who are now retired, they’re holding on to their properties. They’re hoping that they have something that they can pass down to the generations, to the next generation,” Coleman says.But their personal journeys are as distinct as the communities within which they were raised.They diverge on their choice of presidential candidate this November. Their explanations as to why – and their observations of where others in their communities stand on things just weeks before Election Day – offer a candid glance at the opportunities and potential pitfalls facing Trump and Vice PresidentKamala Harris.Hurley Coleman IIICNNA story of resilienceThe Coleman family embodies Saginaw’s economic journey since they arrived in Central Michigan, like so many other Black families, during the manufacturing boom that spurred the Great Migration. The automotive industry was the dominant employer – and between General Motors and the rings of suppliers and support businesses that surrounded the plant here, the community was deeply attached to the company’s operations.“Eighty to ninety percent of the adults in the church were employed full time with GM,” Coleman’s father, a bishop in the Church of God in Christ, says of the congregation he inherited from his own dad.“Right now, in our congregation, I have one person full-time employed by the auto industry,” Hurley Coleman Jr. says.In recent years, other industries have started to move in to provide opportunities that had seemed all too fleeting as the broad-based manufacturing tied to major automakers atrophied in the area.Advanced manufacturing across several industries, including major investments in electric vehicle supply chains, have developed, and major hospitals and medical device companies have expanded their foothold.“The story that I’d like for us to tell is that we’re resilient and that we do bounce back and that we do have people in this region that are thinking towards the future and that we have, hopefully, a new generation of people that will love this region as well, just like we do,” the younger Coleman says.Coleman was sitting at his kitchen table as he toggled between sparks of optimism – for his community and his family – and the weight of what he’s experienced over the past several years.The nonprofit that he leads works with the residents who have the least.“Sometimes when they come in there and we are their last hope,” Coleman says. “The lights are shut off. They have no food in the cabinets. Senior citizens have been sitting at home, nobody to call, nobody to help them out.”The best days are the smiles Coleman sees when his team provides that lifeline. But the weight of being a last resort in a community grappling with violence and poverty can be overwhelming.“There are those days when we have so many people that need help. So many problems, so many issues, so many emergencies and calamities that have happened,” Coleman says.Phil KernerCNNA craftsman and a diminishing tradeBack in Erie, as Phil Kerner flips through the binder on his desk filled with sketches, time cards and family history, it’s apparent there isn’t much he hasn’t saved over the years.There’s the copy of the 1920 census that lists his grandfather Edward as a toolmaker in this corner of northwestern Pennsylvania.The story of Edward’s three sons – two toolmakers and a machinist – shows how deeply intertwined his family had been with the trade and their community at one time.That’s no longer the case.“My grandfather did this. My father did this. My uncles did it. My brothers did it. I did it. My kids aren’t doing it,” Kerner says. “That tells you everything, right?”Kerner still loves his tool and die craft and now works for a local family-owned manufacturer of component parts when he’s not in the workshop he built in his basement.His work can be painstakingly intricate, from the granular details necessary in the sketch of a design to the art and science required to build a plastic injection mold.Toys, storage containers, mechanical parts and other items found in homes across the country are likely to contain the type of thing Kerner specializes in crafting.When President George W. Bush famously stood with a bullhorn on the still-smoldering rubble of ground zero after 9/11, the firefighter standing next to him had a respirator mask around his neck. Kerner designed and built the plastic mold for the mask.But Kerner can pinpoint the exact moment he saw his industry take a turn as part of a decadelong shift to cheaper and faster production overseas.“I realized that my best customer for ten years was - I wouldn’t use the word undermining me - but had totally abandoned a lot of us in Erie that were doing work for them,” Kerner recalled.Kerner remains deeply passionate about his profession, so much so that as he saw interest waning in what he viewed as a top-tier trade, he took matters into his own hands.He launched a YouTube channel titled, naturally, “The Tool and Die Guy.” He has more than 25,000 subscribers.“I’m just what they’re looking for - irreverent enough, you know?” Kerner said with a chuckle. “I’m the toolmaker they always wish they had working next to them.”The videos – now more than 170, including one recapping his sitdown with CNN – was the furthest thing from a vanity project in search of social media fame.Instead, it was an effort born of that passion for his trade – and his deep concern that the appreciation for the skill and craftsmanship that goes with it has diminished in the same way that manufacturing has in places like Erie across the country.The impact, he notes, cuts far deeper than a plant and its employees. The entire community takes the hit.“It’s sad to see it as somebody who has experienced the zenith of manufacturing from the 50s up until the 90s,” Kerner says.A street in Erie, PensylvaniaCNN‘Probably going to call Trump’Kerner cops to being “a little bit of a political junkie,” and he pays close attention to the broader economic news in the country.“I always tell people I’m not a Republican, I’m a realist. I think they’re all terrible,” he says.He knows the broader macroeconomic numbers point to an economy that has exceeded expectations and forecasts for several years running. But his view of the economy is tied to what he’s seeing in his household.“It’s not like my wages are going up,” Kerner says. “Not a complaint, but my wages aren’t going up. And I get it - I see that touted a lot. Wages going up. Wages going up. I talk to my friends, ‘Your wages going up?’ No. I don’t know whose wages are going up.”He describes his decision for who to vote for in similar terms – comparing it to a business owner forced to choose between making payroll or paying suppliers.“If you don’t figure this out, you lose your home. We’re going to foreclose on you. Who are you going to call?” Kerner asks. “Probably going to call Trump.”He estimates about 95% of the people he works with also support Trump.“I think the general consensus in the business community is Trump’s kind of one of us or one of them, you know, because he’s at least on it,” Kerner says. “You ain’t like the way he did it, but that’s his background.”What he’d really like to see, he makes clear repeatedly, is something that flies far beneath the current political radar. Elevated and uniform apprenticeship standards that take into account the importance of the trade – and the value that comes with it, which should ensure lifelong employment in manufacturing.It is, in many ways, the point of his YouTube videos, which have taken on a deeper meaning for him over time.“As long as there’s an internet, people will know that there was a Kerner family in Erie, Pennsylvania. That the tool and die trade was great. That Phil Kerner did it and taught us how to do the best he could,” he says.Hurley Coleman Jr.CNNMore hope with HarrisColeman’s feelings about the November election are summed up in a single word.“Nervous,” he says. “I’m nervous about the future.”For all of the optimism he conveys about Saginaw’s future, the reality of the policy contrasts between the two candidates is very real in his line of work.He sees Trump’s fiscal proposals as directly targeting the federal dollars that help his nonprofit operate.The idea that tax cuts and deregulation will filter down to those on the lower end of the economic spectrum is something he says has never proved to be the case.“They have no idea the everyday, you know, traumas of a person who’s living in poverty,” Coleman says. “People with money could face hardship that causes them to lose their home or forces them to struggle with the high cost of gas.”“But that doesn’t parallel the person who was living in poverty,” Coleman says. “It’s just night and day.”Coleman supported Biden’s reelection – he and his son, HJ, even spent time with the incumbent when he traveled to Saginaw while still a candidate.He’s now supporting Harris and saw the Democratic National Convention as a positive step in outlining what she brings to the table.But it’s clear Democrats have work to do with a critical constituency.“Many Black men in our area are still yet undecided,” Coleman says. He hears often about the border and whether migrants are taking federal aid that could help people in his community.The pandemic-era stimulus checks, which Trump made a point of putting his name on, also come up regularly.“There are people who think that the stimulus checks that came out during the pandemic and things of that nature are something that’s going to happen again,” Coleman’s father says.Still, Biden’s decision to drop out of the race and Harris’ rise has sparked a new level of enthusiasm, according to the elder Coleman.“Now the conversation is not how bad Biden was or how good Trump was, but what possibly could happen with a Harris presidency,” the bishop says. “I think there’s more opportunistic hope that’s been created in the last few weeks.”Driving down Williams Street with the younger Coleman, just before the Saginaw River, it’s impossible to miss the string of abandoned silos that jut into the skyline.Once an unavoidable blot hanging over the city’s business and arts districts, they were transformed a few years ago into a 70,000-square-foot canvas for contract street artists.For Coleman, the eruption of bright colors and unwieldy shapes represents more than just a beautification project.“What was old, what was outdated is about its experience of having transformation and rebirth,” he says, staring at the mural. “And people are going to benefit off of others’ creativity and desire to see change. And I think that’s what those silos represent. And it’s the future for this region.”The Shine Bright Saginaw Mural Project can be seen across the Saginaw River in Saginaw, Michigan, on June 10, 2024.David Guralnick/Detroit News/AP/File","Score: 0

cnn,An EV plant bolstered by Biden’s climate law sparks hope in Northeast Ohio – but not a revival of its Democratic roots,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/25/politics/ev-ohio-economy-biden-trump-harris/index.html,"Lordstown, OhioCNN—For this long-beleaguered region of Northeast Ohio, a gleaming new 2.8 million-square-foot manufacturing plant symbolizes something that has been fleeting in recent years: hope.Hope that years of promises – so often broken or deferred – have been replaced by action in the form of 2,200 employees at theUltium Cells electric vehicle battery plant, which sits at the forefront of cutting-edge green technology and manufacturing.Hope in the shadow of the hulking formerGeneral Motors Lordstown plantthat closed its doors in 2019, forcing workers like George Goranitis to leave the only jobs and homes they knew.“All the mills shutting down, packers shutting down – the last thing here for a good-paying job was General Motors Lordstown,” Goranitis said.The collapse of the lone remaining cornerstone of a manufacturing powerhouse cut to the heart of a proud community.“Members, you know, weren’t able to handle some of the news,” Goranitis recalled. “And, you know, the situations they were in at that time, they took their own lives. There was divorces because of it. You know, families were ripped apart.”The story of the GM plant closure in Mahoning Valley in Northeast Ohio isn’t new.Nor is the story of howDonald Trumptapped into the anxieties within those communities with his bold promises to bring back the manufacturing prowess of old.Here in Trumbull County, for decades a Democratic stronghold filled with union workers, President Barack Obama crushed Republican nominee Mitt Romney by 23 points in 2012.Ultium Cell assembly and production begins at the Ultium Cells LLC facility Thursday, August 11, 2022 in Warren, Ohio.

That made Trump’s bold declarations all the more resonant with the community.“Don’t move,” Trump said as he pledged to bring jobs back to the region. “Don’t sell your house.”Many of the plant’s workers took Trump’s words literally, according to David Green, who served as the local UAW president during Trump’s term in office.Seventeen months later, GM announced that theplant would be idled. Employees who wanted to hold on to their pensions would be required to relocate to other GM facilities. Houses were sold. Many moved. Others were forced to commute each week to the new locations, leaving their families to do so.Trump railed against the GM leadership on Twitter and urged some kind of deal to reopen the plant.Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Uniondale, New York, on September 18, 2024.Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesRelated articleTrump dangles tax relief targeted toward the voters he’s hoping to winBut Green said his letters to the White House pleading for help were ignored – at least until he appeared on Fox News to make his case.Trump was watching.Shortly after, he fired off a tweet aimed squarely at Green.“Democrat UAW Local 1112 President David Green ought to get his act together and produce,” the president wrote. “G.M. let our Country down, but other much better car companies are coming into the U.S. in droves. I want action on Lordstown fast. Stop complaining and get the job done!”It was a heady moment for Green, who like so many others had followed his father onto the GM Lordstown factory floor and had spent his whole career there until the plant closed.“I ignored it because my mama told me, ‘Don’t give it any credibility, and it goes nowhere,’” Green said. “The reality is my daughter got bullied over that. And I didn’t know until just a couple of years ago when she told me. She was a senior in high school, and kids were blaming me and mad at her and bullying her.”Trump then eagerly touted the start-upLordstown Motorsas the savior he was instrumental in delivering.He dispatched his vice president, Mike Pence, to tour the facility in 2020 with cameras in tow.A few months before that fall’s election, Trump held a major promotional event on the South Lawn of the White House, flanked by prototypes of what the company pledged would be the first all-electric commercial pickup truck.“The area was devastated when General Motors moved out, and then we worked together, and we made the deal on the plant,” Trump said as he stood beside the company’s chief executive.The company would go on tofile for Chapter 11 bankruptcythree years later.The executive who stood beside Trump would eventually settle with federal regulators over claims that he misled investors about demand for the first all-electric commercial pickup truck. He did not admit any wrongdoing.The Ultium Cells plant is under construction in Lordstown, Ohio, on October 16, 2020.Megan Jelinger/AFP/Getty ImagesUltium breaks groundGiven the past several years, there was an understandable skepticism in the community when thenew joint venturebetween GM and South Korea’s LG started construction on its planned electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant, which opened in 2022.Standing inside that plant this summer, Josh Ayers was candid about when he came to believe what the future could hold.“Probably when they actually broke ground. I mean, honestly,” Ayers said. When Ayers left the GM plant and his hometown, he never expected to find an opportunity to return to either.“This gives people in the Valley another chance,” Ayers said as he ticked through the reasons people from here so deeply value the community, from friends and family to the familiar (and highly recommended) local restaurants such as Wedgewood Pizza and the Hot Dog Shoppe.Ultium Cell assembly and production begins at the Ultium Cells LLC facility Thursday, August 11, 2022 in Warren, Ohio.

The results here are, at least on their face, clear-cut.And yet.“It’s a hard time right now, right? Because, you know, the unions have always backed Democrats,” Goranitis said. “Always have.

The goal is to counterprogram the Democratic convention by leveling the kinds of policy-based attacks the former president’s allies have urged him to focus on in recent weeks.But for Trump, who advisers say left the GOP convention confident of a comfortable victory in November, lettingPresident Joe Bidengo hasn’t been easy.One adviser, asked if he expected Trump to watch Biden’s speech Monday evening, said simply: “Of course.”He posts on social media about Biden’s decision to step down – and the Democratic pressure that drove the decision – with regularity. He frequently floated, with no evidence or credibility, the idea that Biden would try to step back into the raceuntil a virtual Democratic roll callnominating Harris made that scenario impossible.“I think he’s a little nostalgic for where things were a month ago,” said a Republican who has spoken to Trump in the last few days. “Understandably.”Retired judge and and informal advisor to Vice President Mike Pence, J.

(Photo by OLIVIER DOULIERY / AFP) (Photo by OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images)Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleExclusive: Conservative Republican endorses Harris, calls Trump a threat to democracyTrump’s first battleground-state event of the week, in front of roughly 150 people in a York, Pennsylvania, manufacturing plant earlier Monday, marked a clear – if somewhat nonplussed – effort to stick closely to the economic and energy-focused remarks his advisers wanted him to give.But Trump asked to add a section to the policy remarks a few hours before the event.House Republicans had released a lengthy report making the case for Biden’s impeachment. After months of investigation, the report largely fell flat and contained no evidence that Biden, as vice president, had engaged in activities to benefit his son’s business partners.Trump, however, insisted on adding paragraphs to his remarks summarizing his view of the findings.“I said, ‘No, I want to talk about it, just briefly.’ It’s so sad, because he’s going to be making his speech tonight, and they don’t call him ‘Crooked Joe’ for no reason,” Trump said in York.The former president also levied personal attacks against Harris during his speech and at one point focused on her father,Donald Harris, a retired Stanford University economist.“He’s a Marxist professor. Can you imagine? Does anyone know that? I wonder if they knew that when they did an overthrow or a coup on Joe Biden. I wonder if they knew where she comes from, where she came from, what her ideology is. But you could see it a little bit by this wack job,” Trump said of Harris and her father.The comments about where Harris “comes from” follow Trump’s repeated false attacks onthe vice president’s racial identity. He falsely said last month that Harris – the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India – was “only promoting Indian heritage” and that she only recently “happened to turn Black.” Harris has long embraced and discussed her Black identity, while also honoring her Indian heritage.Trump also attacked Harris’ laugh, which he has mocked repeatedly.“Between his movement and her laugh, there’s a lot of craziness,” Trump said of Biden and Harris. “I’d say a step further than weird. Weird is a nice word by comparison,” the former president added, referencing the recent attack line from Harris and other Democrats that Trump and running mate JD Vance are “weird.”As Trump stood on the floor of the manufacturing plant in York, seeking to portray himself as an ally of manufacturing workers, he said Harris’ economic policies amounted to a “regulatory jihad to shut down power plants all across America.”Trump also falsely claimed that he “won” the classified documents case and that he was “totally exonerated” after US District Judge Aileen Cannondismissed the caseagainst him. Cannon ruled last month that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump, violated the Constitution. But Cannon did not rule on whether Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents was proper or not.In a battleground state where natural gas drives much of the economy, the former president on Monday repeatedly attacked Harris over her past support for a ban on fracking, saying that she was “totally a non-fracker.” As an unsuccessful candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Harris backed a ban on fracking, but her campaign now says she no longer supports such a prohibition.","Score: 1

cnn,Record number of early votes cast in Georgia as election gets underway in battleground state,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/early-voting-record-georgia/index.html,"CNN—A record number ofearly votes have been cast in Georgiaon Tuesday as residents headed to the polls in a critical battleground state that is grappling with the fallout from Hurricane Helene and controversial election administration changes that have spurred a flurry of lawsuits.Roughly 252,000 ballots have been cast Tuesday, Gabe Sterling of the Georgia secretary of state’s office said on X. “Spectacular turnout. We are running out of adjectives for this.”The previous first day record was 136,000 in 2020, Sterling said.The swing state is one of the most closely watched this election, with former President Donald Trump trying to reclaim it after losing there to President Joe Biden by a small margin four years ago, leading Trump and his allies to unsuccessfully push to overturn his defeat.Those efforts have loomed large this year as new changes to how the state conducts elections have been approved by Republican members of the State Election Board, leading Democrats and others to mount legal challenges, many of which have yet to be resolved even as Election Day nears.Despite the massive turnout on Tuesday, the process appeared to go smoother this year for some Atlanta-area voters who spoke with CNN.“Last time I voted, I voted in the city and the lines were out the door. They only had like, maybe like three people working,” said Corine Canada. “So people honestly just started leaving because it was like that. Yeah, like, ‘This is too long. I can’t sit here (and) wait, I have to go back to work.’ But here, no, it was easy.”In this November 2022 photo, people wait in line for early voting for the midterm elections at Ponce De Leon Library in Atlanta.Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images/FileRelated articleWhat to know about early voting in Georgia and North CarolinaParts of the state are continuing to recover from Hurricane Helene, which hit the US last month and wreaked havoc on several other states in the Southeast. Georgia election officials say absentee ballots went out by the US Postal Service as scheduled and were not impacted by the storm.“So far, we have seen just over 250,000 voters request absentee ballots. Perhaps in the next week or so, we’ll see that rise up to 300,000  – and that we think will probably look like around 5-6% of all voters will be voting absentee this cycle,” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said on Tuesday.Experts say that some new state laws that tightened rules for absentee ballots and cracked down on the availability of drop boxes may make the option less appealing than early in-person voting.While many drop boxes were available 24/7 in 2020, this year there will be fewer of them, and they will be in election offices or early vote locations with hours that tend to mimic normal business hours.It’s also possible that the state could continue to see high numbers of early votes given that Georgia law now mandates two Saturdays of early voting and allows for two Sundays of early voting if a county desires.Raffensperger said Tuesday that safeguards are in place for a safe election and that in addition to every race being audited, officials will also randomly audit voting equipment to inspect.“Pulling out a piece of equipment, a random audit on Election Day, bring it to headquarters and then verify that it is recording the votes accurately, that it has not been hacked by any bad actors out there,” Raffensperger told reporters.Raffensperger, who was in Trump’s crosshairs following the 2020 election,re-certified the resultsafter a statewide machine recount in December 2020 that confirmed that Biden beat Trump by just 11,779 votes out of nearly 5 million ballots cast in the Peach State.Legal fights continueMeanwhile, state judges are scrutinizing a number of new rules passed by the Trump-backed Republican majority on the State Election Board that Democrats warn could inject post-election “chaos” into the Georgia.During a marathon court hearing Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney suggested that a rule requiring ballots case on Election Day be hand-counted by poll workers might have been passed too “late in the game” to remain in effect for this cycle. That rule will be under another state judge’s microscope Wednesday as part of cases brought against it by state and national Democrats and civil rights groups.McBurney is also still considering a separate rule passed by the board in August that requires local election officials to conduct a “reasonable inquiry” into election results before certifying them – a mandate that Democrats say could give county election officials broad authority to delay or decline altogether their certification of the results “in a hunt for purported election irregularities.”But McBurney sought to clear up anyuncertainty around certificationin a ruling this week in which he said that local election officials have “a mandatory fixed obligation to certify election results” in the days following the election – dealing a blow to a GOP election official who had asked him to rule that her duties around certification are “discretionary.”What voters are sayingIn line at an Atlanta-area precinct, two voters who identified as Democrats said they were casting ballots for Harris in an effort to avoid the kind of “chaos” they said surrounds Trump.“It is essential that we vote today simply because we want to prevent as much chaos as possible because Donald Trump has proved to be the most vicious, uneducated, racist individual that we have encountered,” said Fay Ainsworth.“Well, we’ve got a crazy person running to be president and a very competent young woman opposing him,” said Joseph Henry King Jr., 77.Kareem Rosshandler, 32, who identifies as an independent, said he was voting for Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein to send a message to Democrats over their support for Israel in its war with Hamas.“We’ve been calling for an arms embargo for the last year and they haven’t been responding, and all the protests and the placards won’t matter if we don’t deliver that message where it really counts, which is at the ballots.”“I mean, the Green Party wants to get rid of the Electoral College,” Rosshandler added. “And that I think is fantastic because right now we have a two-party system, and the only thing worse than that is a one-party system and we’re not that far from that.”CNN’s Mounira Elsamra contributed to this report.","Score: -1

cnn,What to know about early voting in Georgia and North Carolina,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/early-voting-georgia-north-carolina/index.html,"CNN—Two critical battleground states – Georgia and North Carolina – are kicking off early in-person voting this week, and the Peach State is already seeing a record number of voters.Between a flurry of legislative changes and the fallout from Hurricane Helene, the experience could look different for many voters heading to the polls in the coming weeks.In Georgia, voters can head to the ballot box beginning on Tuesday and in North Carolina, early in-person voting begins on Thursday.Georgia is shattering its record for early voting turnout in the critical swing state on Tuesday, according to state election officials, with over 188,000 votes cast by 2 p.m. ET. “We are looking at blowing by 200,000 votes cast in person today. Hats off to our counties and the voters who are turning out. HUGE!” Gabriel Sterling with Georgia’s Secretary of State office posted on social media.Here’s what to know about how voting and elections will work in two key swing states.GeorgiaFewer drop boxes but more ways to vote earlyNew state laws after 2020 that tightened rules for absentee ballots and cracked down on the availability of drop boxes may make the option less appealing than early in-person voting, election experts said.While many drop boxes were available 24/7 in 2020, this year there will be fewer of them, and they will be in election offices or early vote locations with hours that tend to mimic normal business hours.In this November 2022 photo, people wait in line for early voting for the midterm elections at Ponce De Leon Library in Atlanta.Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images/FileRelated articleGeorgia judge says county election officials cannot delay or decline certification of election results“The drop boxes have really been made so inconvenient to use that fewer voters are able to utilize them,” said Kristin Nabers, the Georgia state director for All Voting is Local. “I don’t want to discourage people from using drop boxes by any means, but I can see why people would think it’s easier to show up in person.”Meanwhile, the opportunities to vote early in-person have expanded: Georgia law mandates two Saturdays of early voting and allows for two Sundays of early voting if a county desires.Limits on feeding people in lineA 2021 law that makes it a crime to offer food or drinks to voters waiting to cast a ballot – which was highly publicized by news outlets and immortalized by comedian Larry David in episodes of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” – mostly survived legal challenges. So, offering a bottle of water or a snack to voters within 150 feet of a building where ballots are being cast is still banned.The law also sought to ban offers of food or beverages within 25 feet of a voter standing in line, even if it was well beyond 150 feet of the building where ballots were being cast. A judge paused that provision, allowing voting rights groups to offer so-called line relief to voters that may find themselves waiting in particularly long lines.Hoping to speed up results but worries about uncertaintyThe Peach State made several changes to try to get voters faster election results. At 8 p.m. ET on election night, counties are required to report results from their early in-person and absentee ballots. As counties tabulate the Election Day vote, they’ll provide updates at regular intervals. The goal, according to Georgia’s secretary of state, is to provide speedy, fair and transparent results.A polling station is pictured during the primary elections in Atlanta in May 2022.DUSTIN CHAMBERS/ReutersRelated articleGeorgia group that pushes election misinformation gains influence with election officialsAt the same time,several new rulespassed by a Donald Trump-backed Republican majority on the Georgia State Election Board are creating uncertainty around the post-election process. The board passed a rule requiring a hand count of the number of ballots at each voting location, which could potentially delay the reporting of results.The board also passed rules allowing county officials to examine extensive election materials prior to certifying and requiring those officials to conduct a “reasonable inquiry” before they certify results.There are ongoing lawsuits related to all the new rules, which Democrats and voting rights activists worry could be exploited by county-level officials who want to try to challenge election results or delay the certification process.North CarolinaImpact of Hurricane Helene damageOfficials in North Carolina have been scrambling in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene to ensure residents are still able to cast a ballot.“I think there will be a drop off, it’s hard to really predict how much,” Bob Phillips, executive director of Common Cause North Carolina said of the storm’s impact on turnout. “But I’m encouraged so far by the response the State Board of Elections has done to educate folks on what to do and how to vote.”FILE PHOTO: A resident enters a FEMA's improvised station to attend claims by local residents affected by floods following the passing of Hurricane Helene, in Marion, North Carolina, U.S., October 5, 2024.

Acceptable forms of ID include a driver’s license, passport and student photo IDs that have been approved by the state election board.There are exceptions if a voter is unable to provide identification and one of those exceptions is a natural disaster. In that case, voters fill out an ID exception form that accompanies their ballot. The state election board notes that county election boards are required to count provisional ballots that include ID exception forms.Ballot selfiesBoth Georgia and North Carolina prohibit photographing ballots.“In this day and age, everyone’s taking selfies, even people in the boomer generation like me,” Phillips from Common Cause North Carolina said. “But there definitely is a law that says no selfies.”Phillips noted that voters are still able to take their phones into a polling place if they want to look up information about who they’re voting for. That’s not the case in every state.CNN’s Tierney Sneed contributed to this report.This story has been updated with additional developments.","Score: -1

cnn,"Israel assures US it plans to target Iran’s military, not oil or nuclear sites, source says",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/israel-iran-military-oil-nuclear-sites/index.html,"CNN—Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have assured the United States that a counterstrike on Iran will be limited to military targets rather than oil or nuclear facilities, according to a person familiar with the discussions.President Joe Biden, who has conveyed in public his opposition to striking Tehran’s nuclear and oil facilities, discussed Israel’s plans with Netanyahu during a classified phone call last week. In that conversation, Netanyahu relayed to Biden his plan to hit military targets, the person said.The Washington Postfirst reported that Netanyahu had reassured Biden of his plans to avoid nuclear and oil targets.Responding to that report, Netanyahu’s office said it will consider US opinions but ultimately decide itsresponse to Iran’s October 1 attackbased on its own national interests. And American officials said they were still closely coordinating with Israel as it decides how to respond.“We listen to the opinions of the United States, but we will make our final decisions based on our national interests,” Netanyahu’s office wrote on X.The White House previously described the phone call between the leaders last week as “productive” and “direct.” It was their first conversation in nearly two months.“Our commitment to Israel’s defense is ironclad. We will not discuss private diplomatic discussions and would refer you to the Israeli government to speak to their own potential military operations,” a spokesman for the White House’s National Security Council said Tuesday.Israel’s deliberations over how to respond to Iran come at a moment of high tensions in the year-long conflict, which has expanded beyond Gaza into Lebanon. At the White House, officials have worked to limit Israel’s retaliation to the barrage of ballistic missiles, hoping to prevent a wider war.Still, Biden and other top officials have maintained Israel has a right to respond, and have said they were in close coordination with their counterparts as they mulled a decision.A strike on oil fields that could send energy prices soaring would be unwelcome weeks ahead of the US election, officials have said. And hitting Iran’s nuclear facilities could trigger the full-blown regional war that Biden has desperately sought to avoid.American officials have said they expected a measured response from Israel, believing the country did not want an out-of-control conflict with Iran.

cnn,Two House incumbents seek to woo the other party’s voters in Pacific Northwest swing seats,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/crossover-incumbents-pacific-northwest/index.html,"Ridgefield, WashingtonCNN—Dozens of families lined up outside the Clark County Fairgrounds here on a recent Saturday, their young kids eager to ride on tractors, toss balls into massive vacuum truck hoses and add new stickers to their tiny construction hats.Democratic Rep.Marie Gluesenkamp Perezstood before the crowd with her husband, Dean, and young son, ready to cut the caution tape-style ribbon that would signal the start of Dozer Days.“I don’t know about you guys, but we have been talking about how many sleeps until Dozer Days for about a month,” she said into a bullhorn at the recent campaign stop. “Thank you all for being part of a culture that believes in making stuff, and being proud of who we are as the best tradespeople in the world.”The construction-themed event is designed to introduce young children to careers as journeymen linemen fixing electrical lines or vacuum truck operators cleaning storm drains – the exact kinds of jobs Gluesenkamp Perez has advocated during her first term in Congress representing this rural district in southwest Washington, even if it has meant pushing back on Democratic efforts to cancel debt for college students.As Gluesenkamp Perez faces a rematch against far-right Republican Joe Kent in one of the most competitive races in the country, focusing on this corner of the Evergreen State and its issues could be the key to holding on to a district thatDonald Trumpcarried by 4 points in 2020 and is likely to win again this November.Washington’s 3rd Congressional District is one of 21 “crossover” seats whose House representative is of the opposing party to the presidential candidate who carried the district four years ago. Those seats – five held by Democrats and 16 by Republicans – will likely determine which party controls the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Two of those seats are here in the Pacific Northwest: South of Gluesenkamp Perez’s district, another freshman congresswoman, RepublicanLori Chavez-DeRemer, is seeking reelection in a seat that backedJoe Bidenby 8 points in 2020.Such seats – where bipartisanship is a necessity, not a choice – have become increasingly rare. Twenty years ago, there were nearly 60 crossover districts,according to an analysisby the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. In these districts, incumbents usually assert their independence from their national parties and tout their work across the aisle, as their opponents seek to nationalize the contests and urge party allegiance.And as partisanship has increased, it’s become harder for these candidates to navigate the demands of both aNovember electorate that rewards bipartisanship and base voters who punish party disloyalty in primaries.For Gluesenkamp Perez, finding that balance has involved joining a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Washington, DC, for daily CrossFit workouts to find legislative partners. It’s also meant voting against the Biden administration on key issues such as student debt cancellation, a vote that prompted outraged progressives from across the country to flood the Yelp and Google pages of her family’s auto repair shop with negative reviews.“For me, it’s not productive to think about it as I’m asking people to make a political choice,” Gluesenkamp Perez said in an interview between campaign events. “I’m just trying to bring back power and respect to people in the trades and people in my community.”Primary defeatsOver the past two years, voters in this region have felt the consequences of ousting centrist House incumbents.Gluesenkamp Perez’s predecessor, Jaime Herrera Beutler, was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after January 6, 2021. But in 2022, after representing the district for more than a decade, she lost a top-two open primary, finishing behind Gluesenkamp Perez and Kent, a retired Green Beret who had Trump’s endorsement. The Democrat went on to win the general election by 2,600 votes.A few miles south, a similar story played out in Oregon’s 5th District, where longtime Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader, a member of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition, lost his primary to progressive Jamie McLeod-Skinner. Schrader had Biden’s endorsement but had angered the left by voting against Democratic priorities such as Covid-19 relief funding and allowing Medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs, which he opposed in a committee hearing prior to backing a narrower Medicare negotiation plan on the House floor.McLeod-Skinner lost the general election to Chavez-DeRemer, the former mayor of Happy Valley, by 2 points in a district that stretches south from the Portland suburbs to Bend.Like Gluesenkamp Perez, Chavez-DeRemer has touted her efforts in Congress to work with the party that dominates her district. The pair, who often share the same flights between Portland and DC, touted their work together on the House Agriculture Committee’s Forestry panel and inadvocating border security funding and defense-only aidto Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.Chavez-DeRemer has sought to localize her race against Democratic state Rep. Janelle Bynum despite the national implications.“Sure, it does make sense that people want to put you in a box of red or blue,” Chavez-DeRemer said of her experience running in a Democratic-leaning district. “But really, it’s just sticking to what you’ve been doing, that people trust you, and then they’ll vote for who they believe is going to best represent the district as a whole.”Eager to avoid a 2022 general election rematch, Democrats waded into this year’s primary to back Bynum over McLeod-Skinner. Bynum previously defeated Chavez-DeRemer twice in state legislative elections around Clackamas, a Portland suburb.Former President Barack Obama speaks at a campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris at the University of Pittsburgh on October 10, 2024.Jeff Swensen/Getty ImagesRelated articleObama’s reemergence on the campaign trail for Harris comes as he recognizes his own legacy is at stake“I think Democrats did realize that, ‘Whoops, Kurt Schrader wasn’t exactly the far-left guy we love with the Green New Deal and all that sort of thing,’ but they realized that they’d gone a little too far,” Schrader said. “I think Janelle is still very progressive, but a little bit less so.”Democrats say they’re optimistic about their new candidate and believe they have more experience with the new congressional map, which changed last cycle after Oregon gained a sixth seat following the 2020 census. They are also leaning into the national implications of the race.As part of a tour through battleground districts, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries recently held a news conference with Bynum in her Clackamas campaign office. The two were flanked by dozens of supporters, including several union members, an effort to counter Chavez-DeRemer’s endorsements from organized labor.Bynum spoke of her own record in Salem, where she led bipartisan legislation to fund the state’s semiconductor industry and backed Oregon’s abortion protections, which were enacted in 2017 after Trump became president. She argued that Chavez-DeRemer had “sided with the most extreme members of her party,” blasted her record on abortion and criticized her decision to endorse Trump.“She’s stood by Donald Trump at every turn,” Bynum said. “She’s standing by her man even after he was convicted of 34 felony counts.”Jeffries said Bynum would be a vote for passing federal abortion protections and advancing what Vice President Kamala Harris has described as an “opportunity economy.” He also touted Bynum’s two previous victories against Chavez-DeRemer.“We’re going for the trifecta, going for the triple crown, and we’re going for the three-peat,” he said.Abortion and crimeBoth parties recognize the significance of the two seats, which could play a role in tipping the balance of power in the House, where Democrats need a net gain of four seats to earn control. In both races, Democrats have leaned into abortion rights and Republicans have focused on crime.“The Pacific Northwest is key to a House Democratic majority,” Dan Gottlieb, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a statement. “As different as these districts are, the through lines are clear: Lori Chavez-DeRemer and Joe Kent are content to stoke on the chaos and dysfunction we see in Congress and let politicians dictate women’s health care decisions.”Ben Petersen, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, tied the two Democrats to the fallout from Oregon’s decriminalization of hard drugs.From left, John Duarte, Tom Kean Jr. and Matt Gunderson.CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images/Matt Gunderson for CongressRelated articleHouse Republicans attempt to avoid 2022 letdown with new tactic on abortion: ‘We’re both pro-choice’“Republicans are full speed ahead to grow our majority because voters in both districts reject Democrats’ extreme agenda fueling Portland’s crime, fentanyl and homelessness crisis,” Petersen said.In Oregon, Democrats have pointed to Chavez-DeRemer’s shifting stances on abortion. Shesupported the overturning of Roe v. Wadeand said during her 2022 Republican primary thatshe would “be in favor of passing”legislation that would ban the procedure after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is around six weeks. In Congress, she opposed legislation that would have blocked federal subsidies to insurance plans that cover abortions, but she also voted against a defense bill amendment to reimburse service members who need to travel out of state to receive abortions or other reproductive care.Chavez-DeRemer has said that she would support the will of Oregon voters, who overwhelmingly support abortion rights, and that she is opposed to a national abortion ban. She said she opposed the defense bill amendment because she wanted to use that legislation to focus on national security and argued it wouldn’t affect Oregonians’ rights, in part because the state has a fund to help pay for people’s travel expenses.“I am not pro-choice enough for the choice groups. I’m not pro-life enough for the life groups, because I’m where most Americans are, which is down the middle,” Chavez-DeRemer said in an interview.Republicans, in turn, have pointed to Bynum’s record in the state legislature, as well as her past support for a 2020 ballot initiative that decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs and sought to expand funding for addiction treatment.“Not only was it a failed experiment, but people are dead because of it in Oregon,” Chavez-DeRemer said. “That accountability cannot just go away – you don’t get to just say, ‘I think this is not working out.’”In 2020, Bynum backed the citizen-led initiative Measure 110 with reservations, noting that it would have looked different if it had originated with the legislature. Though the initiative passed with more than 58% of the vote, Bynum and other lawmakers voted torecriminalize drugsthis year as the state saw a rise in fentanyl use and a delay in the treatment protocols.“There were a lot of people in my caucus who wanted to continue to work through the status quo and say, ‘Well, we haven’t given it enough time,’” Bynum said in an interview. “And there were those of us who were like, ‘My kids can’t even ride the public bus because people are tweaking out.’ … That wasn’t what we signed up for.”She has also defended her record on public safety, pointing to bipartisan police accountability reforms she led in 2021.Other criticisms have scrutinized Bynum’s record on handling sexual harassment allegations. One Congressional Leadership Fund ad pointed to a campaign contribution she made to a colleague in the legislature who was under investigation for sexual harassment.In recent days Republicans have also latched onto a complaint that alleged Bynum didn’t report allegations of misconduct made in 2019 against a campaign operative assigned to her 2022 campaign by Oregon House Democrats’ campaign arm.Bynum is not under investigation. She has said that she did report the misconduct to the accused person’s employer. A spokesperson for the Bynum campaign called the allegation that she did not report harassment an attempt to “smear” the candidate that was “not based in reality.”“MAGA Republicans are lying to Oregon voters about Janelle Bynum’s record because they know their candidate has no record to stand on here in Oregon,” the spokesperson wrote.A nationalized raceWhile Gluesenkamp Perez has sought to distance herself from national Democrats – she has declined to endorse Harris or say who she will vote for in November – Kent has campaigned as a Trump ally.He’s also sought to move away from some of the policy positions and controversies that alienated moderates in his first run – whenhe called for a national abortion banthat would overturn protections in states such as Washington,spoke at a right-wing rally in DCaimed at supporting insurrectionists charged in the deadly January 6 riot, and frequently had to disavow or distance himselffrom White nationalists and Nazi sympathizers.Earlier this year, Kent laid out three things his campaign would do differently: stop discouraging Election Day voting, focus more on local issues and reach out to a broader base of Republicans. He has leaned into his personal story, including his status as a Gold Star husband after his wife was killed in 2019 by a suicide bomber in Syria, and hastried to mend fences with moderate Republicans. On abortion, he now says he doesn’t support new federal legislation on the issue but instead wants to promote pro-family policies, such as making diapers tax exempt.The contrast between the two candidates’ approaches was clear at a recent debate with Gluesenkamp Perez. At one point during the debate, both candidates had the opportunity to ask each other a question.In response to Kent’s question on why she voted against House Republicans’ legislation to ban transgender girls from playing on girls’ sports team, Gluesenkamp Perez said she took a “libertarian” approach to the issue and worried it would have subjected young girls to genital examinations.She then asked Kent why he called her legislation to block a rule that would have made table saws more expensive a waste of time.“While our southern border is wide open, while the price at the pump and the grocery store is really hurting working Americans, Congress is doing these little performative measures,” Kent said. “We need to do these big lifts to get the federal government bureaucracy out of our daily lives, in terms of our business and our natural resources industries, secure our border, stop the out-of-control spending – then we’ll talk about table saws.”Eric Burleson, a 45-year-old saw mill worker, said Kent did a better job at debating, but he preferred the points Gluesenkamp Perez made.“It seems like he was focusing more on the country, what he could do for the country, and she was focused on what she could do for our area itself,” he said.Former Manchester, New Hampshire, Mayor Joyce Craig, left, and former New Hampshire Sen. Kelly AyotteDerek Stokely/WMUR-TV/APRelated articleNation’s most competitive governor’s race tests the power of ticket-splitters in New HampshireBurleson said he voted for Kent in the 2022 general election but voted for Gluesenkamp Perez in this year’s August primary after getting a personal phone call from her office when he wrote in about an issue. The Longview resident, who voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, is the sort of voter Gluesenkamp Perez has sought to win over. Burleson said he’s unsure of how he’ll vote in the presidential election, but he’s leaning toward Glusenkamp Perez at the congressional level.“I don’t really choose between straight party lines. I kind of go with whoever I think has the best ideas,” he said. “If it’s a Democrat for one office and a Republican for another one, whoever has the best ideas, in my opinion, is probably who I’d vote for.”In a brief interview following a town hall in Vancouver, Washington, Kent argued that his top priorities are local ones.“I think the biggest issues right now, especially for Congress, it’s the out-of-control inflation, which is handled in DC, but it’s a very local issue,” he said. “And same thing with the border. That seems like a very big national issue, but if you look at what fentanyl has done to the community here, it’s pretty local issue as well.”At the Vancouver gathering, Kent and his supporters leaned into those national topics. He echoed his warnings of an invasion at the border, saying there were “young and fit men” crossing into the US and joking that people should stay away from the US Capitol on January 6 because it’s “a trap,” after one voter spoke of a rumor that Democrats wouldn’t certify the election results.After another voter asked what Republicans plan to do about the “cheating,” Kent went after Washington state’s all-mail ballot system, saying he didn’t think “Democrats import 10 to 12 million illegals here out of the kindness of their hearts,” and, to paraphrase Trump, that his margin in November must be “too big to rig.”Kent conceded his narrow 2022 loss to Gluesenkamp Perez after paying for a recount but has asserted that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud influencing that result.Kent urged those in the room in Vancouver to vote straight ticket to counter Gluesenkamp Perez’s efforts to sway Trump voters.“That’s her entire strategy right now,” he said. “We’ve got to get all of our people who are going to get a ballot to vote Republican all the way down.”Joan Dunn, an 84-year-old retiree from Vancouver who attended the event, agreed. Democrats, she claimed, tend to vote with their party, while Republicans will vote for people who are “nicer.” It’s a lesson her party has yet to learn, she said.“It doesn’t work that way,” she said. “That’s not how you get control of the Senate and the House in order to do the country’s business.”CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that former Oregon Rep. Kurt Schrader voted in a committee hearing against a proposal to allow Medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs but supported a narrower plan on the House floor.","Score: 0

The House GOP campaign arm, however, reported a six-figure donation from billionaireElon Musklast month as the party seeks to defend its razor-thin majority in the chamber.And with Democrats riding a wave of donor enthusiasm, the latest filings with the Federal Election Commission also showed some key outside groups ramping up their activity, while a leading pro-Trump super PAC unleashed a massive wave of independent expenditures to help Republicans close the gap.Harris’ surgeHarris has fully erased the financial edge that Trump momentarily gained over the summer, when the former president outraisedPresident Joe Bidenin two of the final three months before Biden withdrew from the race in late July. The vice president took in nearly $190 million directly to her campaign in August – more than quadrupling the $44.5 million that the Trump campaign said flowed to its principal campaign account that month.The Harris campaign also dramatically outspent the Trump campaign in August, burning through about $174 million. It plowed most of that into advertising – $135 million – as it raced to introduce Democrats’ newly minted nominee to voters on an abbreviated schedule. Some $6.4 million went toward payroll expenses and $4.5 million to text-messaging outreach.In this April 2022 photo, North Carolina Lt. Gov.

Harris’ broader network announced it had raised acombined total of $361 millionin August, nearly triple the $130 million Trump’s operation said it brought in.Harris’ fundraising dominance has helped give Democrats a significant edge in advertising bookings this fall, including in key battleground states. And the vice president and her allies are overwhelming the former president’s presence on social media.

The $361 million is by far the best monthly haul for either party this cycle.If this rate continues, Harris is poised to collect more than $1 billion in the condensed campaign window between becoming the party’s de facto nominee in late July and Election Day. She’s already raised more than $615 million since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on July 21, her campaign noted Friday.“In just a short time, Vice President Harris’ candidacy has galvanized a history-making, broad, and diverse coalition – with the type of enthusiasm, energy, and grit that wins close elections,” Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement.Last month’s haul toppedthe $310 millionthat Harris and Democrats raised in July and came amid the fanfare of her announcing Minnesota Gov.

An earlier CNN analysis of donations that exceeded $200 this cycle found that some ofTrump’s biggest fundraising dayscame in May around his felony conviction in New York, exceeding even the amounts the campaign reported collecting in July during his party’s nominating convention.Harris campaign officials said they are plowing their money into reaching voters, citing a “weekend of action” in the coming days that will feature 2,000 events and a $370 million digital and TV ad campaign running through the election. The campaign said it also has established more than 312 offices with the Democratic Party and employs more than 2,000 staffers with the party across battleground states but warned of a close, hard-fought contest in the home stretch.The presidential campaigns will release a full accounting of their August fundraising and spending later this month in filings with federal election regulators.","Score: -1

abcnews,Trump says US troops should be used to go after 'radical left.' Can he do that?,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/could-trump-use-military-go-after-radical-left/story?id=114806253,"The military isn't supposed to police Americans, but there are exceptions.
Former President Donald Trump saysactive-duty or National Guard troops could be usedto go after ""radical left lunatics"" to handle any Election Day chaos, warning that the bigger problem facing the United States isn't a foreign enemy but ""the people from within.""
The suggestion of using military force following a political election is hypothetical, considering Trump won't have command of U.S. troops in November. If he wins the election, Trump wouldn't gain control of the armed forces until mid-January following the inauguration.
But deploying the military within U.S. borders is a suggestion Trump has made before, including the idea that the military could police the southern border and help deport an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.
""I think the bigger problem are the people from within,"" Trump told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures.""
""We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics... And it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard or really necessary by the military, because they can't let that happen,"" he said.
So, can a president use U.S. troops to police Americans and quash political protests?
Many of Trump's supporters say yes, citing a 200-year-old law meant to curb rebellions. The Insurrection Act of 1807 was used during the Civil War and throughout the 1960s to enforce civil rights laws.
Legal experts are now warning the law is dangerously vague and ripe for abuse.
Here's what to know about the use of military power on U.S. soil:
The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act mostly prohibits active-duty military troops from carrying out law enforcement duties inside the United States.
The idea behind the law is that any president -- as commander in chief of U.S. forces -- shouldn't be allowed to use federal military might against its own citizens.
But it's a different law that was passed earlier that century that's caught the attention of many Trump supporters.
First enacted in 1807, theInsurrection Actsays the president can call on a militia or the U.S. armed forces if there's been ""any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination or conspiracy"" in a state that ""opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.""
According to theBrennan Center for Justice, the law has been invoked dozens of times throughout history, including by Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and by Lyndon B. Johnson to quell rioting after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
In 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower used the law to deploy members of the Army's 101st Airborne Division to escort nine Black students into Little Rock Central High School, after the Arkansas governor used the state's National Guard to prevent the students from entering the school.
More recently, the law was invoked by President George H.W. Bush during the1992 riots inLos Angelesthat followed the trial acquittal of police officers in the Rodney King case. The law was also under consideration in 2005 following Hurricane Katrina, but was not used.
In the days leading up to the Jan. 6 riot, some Trump supporters wanted the president to invoke the Insurrection Act as a justification for far-right militia groups to storm the Capitol and to keep Trump in power despite losing the election.
Trump falsely claimed he won the election, but never invoked the Insurrection Act while in office.
Legal experts have proposed reforms to the Insurrection Act, includingone proposalearlier this year by the American Law Institute.
""There is agreement on both sides of the aisle that the Insurrection Act gives any president too much unchecked power,""Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor and former assistant attorney general in the Bush administration, said last April.
It's unlikely, though, that such a sharply divided Congress would take up the issue any time soon.
There's another law, too, that Trump could try to rely on when it comes to handling illegal immigration -- the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which allows the president to deport any noncitizen from a country that the U.S. is at war with.
In his interview withTime magazinethis year, Trump didn't cite a legal justification when he said he'd use the National Guard to conduct mass deportations and create detention camps for people living illegally inside the U.S.
In the end, whether any of Trump's proposals are legal would likely be determined by the courts, including federal judges he appointed.

Donald Trump, in a recent interview, suggested his political opponents are more of a threat to the U.S. than top foreign adversaries such as China and Russia when it comes to the 2024 election.
""I think the bigger problem are the people from within,"" Trumptold Fox Newsanchor Maria Bartiromo. ""We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics.""
Then he floated the idea of deploying the military against them on American soil, arguing without proof they would be more likely to sow chaos on Nov. 5 than his supporters -- despite what transpired on Jan. 6, 2021.
""I think it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen,"" Trump added.
The dark comments highlight Trump's increasing bend toward authoritarian rhetoric in his third White House campaign, some political scientists told ABC News.
""It's really classic authoritarian discourse,"" said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University professor and author of ""How Democracies Die,"" citing examples from 1930s Europe and 1960s Latin America.
""In each of these cases, autocrats used exactly this language: there's an enemy within that's more dangerous than our external enemies and that justifies the use of extra-constitutional measures,"" he said. ""How many times does Trump have to use this rhetoric before we realize that this is not a normal election?""
Trump's ""enemy from within"" comments come after a history of praising authoritarian leaders in public as well asthreats to jail election workers, pledges to take on the civil service and toenact retributionon political enemies if elected -- all of which would significantly stretch the normal limits of executive power.
Vice President Kamala Harris, playing clips of his Fox News comments, painted Trump as ""increasingly unstable and unhinged"" and ""out for unchecked power"" at a Pennsylvania rally on Monday.
""He considers anyone who doesn't support him or who will not bend to his will an enemy of our country. It's a serious issue,"" Harris said. ""He is saying that he would use the military to go after them.""
Harris added, ""This is among the reasons I believe so strongly that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America and dangerous.""
Meanwhile, some Republicans attempted to downplay Trump's comments.
Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate, said he thought they were related to illegal migrants -- despite Trump specifically shifting his conversation with Bartiromo away from undocumented immigrants or foreign actors toward who he called ""radical left lunatics.""
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, tried to make a similar argument on CNN, in what turned into a tense exchange with host Jake Tapper as Youngkin said he ""didn't believe"" that Trump was talking about using the military against Democrats.
The Trump campaign, too, suggested the former president's comments were related to immigration.
""The Harris-Biden administration has unconscionably abused our refugee and asylum systems, and turned them into programs to import mass numbers of unvetted migrants from the most dangerous countries on earth, at the expense of Christians and other persecuted religious minorities who those programs were intended to help,"" spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement to ABC News.
Critics expressed concern not only about Trump's comments but how they're being received by the GOP.
""All the time in authoritarian states you see branding of some faction of the political opposition not as loyal opposition but as enemy opposition,"" said Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton University.
Scheppele noted the U.S. has some history with this, such as Republican President Richard Nixon and GOP Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy's abuses of power to go after perceived political foes.
But there is a key distinction between then and now, she said, in that Nixon and McCarthy were ostracized by their peers.
""This one is really different because Trump's got this mass movement and a set of people who are willing to fight for him,"" Scheppele said.
Levitsky said so long as Republicans are standing by Trump, ""democracy is going to be in trouble.""
""I think the most shocking thing is not what Trump said, but the silence that we hear in response to it, particularly among conservative elites who know better, or who should know better,"" Levitsky said.

abcnews,"Democrats, Republicans lining up in new ways in 2024. No one knows what's next.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/parties-coalitions-changing-election-day/story?id=114793336,"""We can't take voters for granted,"" one Democrat said.
The Democratic and Republican Parties' coalitions are undergoing a seismic change just weeks before Vice President Kamala Harris and former PresidentDonald Trumpface off against each other.
What comes after Election Day is anyone's guess.
Harris is overperforming with seniors, sparking speculation she could even win a demographic that has traditionally leaned Republican. Trump, meanwhile, is eating into Democrats' edge with Black and Hispanic voters, particularly males, eroding a gap that has sunk past GOP presidential contenders.
The 2024 presidential election therefore marks not just a key race to see who leads the country but also one of the first contests under what could be brand new dynamics for the parties. Gone, at least for now, are the days of Republicans banking on the support of older voters -- some of the nation's most reliable ballot punchers -- and Democrats' proclamations that demography is destiny.
""The trend lines are that we can't take voters for granted, neither party can take voters for granted. The coalitions are shifting,"" said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic strategist and former communications director for Harris' vice-presidential office.
Poll after poll suggests voter preferences are altering with little time to suss out what the changes mean.
A CNN/SSRS poll released last month showed Harris leading Trump 50-46 among voters 65 years old and up. No Democratic presidential contender has carried that group since Al Gore in 2000.
Meanwhile, a recent Pew poll showed Trump getting 14% support among Black voters and 38% support among Hispanic voters, compared to 79% and 54% for Harris, respectively. In 2020, President Joe Biden won 87% support from Black voters and 65% support from Latinos.
Those numbers are even starker when divided by gender.
Biden won 79% support from Black men and 59% support among Hispanic men four years ago. In the pew poll, those numbers dropped to 72% support for Harris from Black men and 53% support for her from Hispanic men.
The shifting numbers have the campaigns and outside operatives scrambling to figure out why voter preferences are changing the way they are and how long after Nov. 5 that shift will continue.
Strategists in both parties speculated that seniors defecting to Harris are motivated by temperament and healthcare and are potentially spooked by the Jan. 6, 2021, riot on Capitol Hill and repeated Democratic attacks that Republicans will go after long-coveted entitlement programs.
""One is, is that Democrats have done a lot for seniors. Thirty-five-dollar insulin, $2,000 cap on prescription drugs, negotiating with Medicare, etc., etc. They have an advantage on voters trust them on Social Security and Medicare more than Republicans. And I think that there's a qualitative thing, which is, I don't think for seniors, Trump is their type of Republican. They don't like his behavior,"" said John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster who conducts surveys for both Harris' campaign and AARP.
Black and Latino voters, meanwhile, are thought to be leaning more on economic arguments than racial ones that Democrats had long deployed. Those voters, experts said, have defied traditional thinking of voters with uniquely strong cultural concerns and instead are taking into account similar concerns as white working-class voters.
""What you're seeing is this transformation of things like race and ethnicity, where Black and brown voters are increasingly becoming more Republican for reasons that are clearly not racial,"" said Mike Madrid, a GOP strategist who studies and writes about Latino voting patterns. ""This peculiar interaction between race, economic class and diplomas or college education...are happening in very unique ways that are reshaping the coalitions.""
""The Democratic Party is becoming more white, it's becoming less diverse, and where it's concentrating voters is with college-educated white progressives who are much more insulated to the economy and economic shocks and things like inflation and recessions. Those aren't issues for them. What is, is abortion rights, gun control, marriage equality,"" he said.
Economic frustrations are thought to be particularly motivating among men, with whom Trump is consolidating support.
""Democrats have to talk about issues that are important to men, which are very often economic issues, particularly around aspirations. Men want to be able to take care of their families, be contributors to society, and have the standing that comes with a good job or a good business,"" Simmons said.
Each candidate is putting in work to stem their losses.
Trump has boasted of his plan to end taxes on Social Security income, and Harris is waging a full court media blitz to bring Black men back into the fold, appearing on key radio shows and deploying former President Barack Obama to deliver a stern message to those potentially wary of electing a female president.
The country will only have to wait mere weeks to see if those efforts will pay off -- for this election. Even the most veteran operatives aren't sure what happens from Nov. 6 onward.
Trump has said this will be his last race, and his singular hold on the GOP may not be replicated, meaning the day after he leaves the stage -- whenever that happens -- could mark a watershed political moment.
""I think you're asking the right questions. I just don't have all the right answers,"" GOP pollster Whit Ayres said when asked what comes next. ""I am loathe to try to give a prediction about what a party would look like without a figure that has so dominated the party for the last eight years.""
Some strategists think the dynamics will snap back -- with seniors going back to Republicans and voters of color coming home to the Democratic Party, arguing that the unique personalities in this year's race are driving the movement, as seen by more traditional trends playing out in some down-ballot races.
""If he goes away, if we beat him, I think that this whole thing starts lining back up as long as you have a strong Democratic nominee,"" said Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha. ""I don't see all the opportunities once Donald Trump is gone, because the Donald Trump phenomenon is only happening with Donald Trump.""
""I think Trump is seen as better on the economy among a subset of younger voters than most Republicans. So, I think it will be challenging for Republicans writ large to mimic that success,"" added a source familiar with the Harris campaign's thinking.
Others disagreed, noting that the trends that are producing the changes, such as a rise in populism, were bubbling up prior to Trump and will outlive his political career.
""I don't think Trump is the driver of this,"" Madrid said. ""These dynamics began before him.
""I don't think it's as clear as to say one group is going to benefit over the other. I think what we're seeing is the movement of all these pieces away from a right-left spectrum to a top-down spectrum,"" he added.
Still others predicted a whole new ballgame.
Trump has undoubtedly altered America's politics, and, as seen by the failures of some of his primary rivals, his personal brand is difficult to replicate -- meaning without him on a ticket, the country might simply be staring into the political unknown.
""Floodgates open up for there to be competition among subgroups. I absolutely believe that. I think all bets are off. And it just depends on who the candidates are on both sides,"" Anzalone said. ""There may be no snapping back.""

abcnews,Arrest made in connection with FEMA threats in North Carolina,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/threats-fema-workers-north-carolina-sheriff/story?id=114776904,"The man was armed with a handgun and rifle, according to the sheriff's office.
The sheriff's office in Rutherford County, NC, announced Monday that they'd arrested a man and charged him with allegedly threatening to harm Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) workers in the area.
William Parsons, 44, of Bostic, NC, was charged with ""going armed to the terror of the public,"" according to a statement from the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office provided to ABC News.
The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office statement said deputies on Saturday investigated reports in the vicinity of Lake Lure and Chimney Rock that a ""white male had an assault rifle and made the comment about possibly harming FEMA employees"" working in the area. Witnesses were able to provide enough information for law enforcement to ultimately locate and identify Parsons, who was armed with a handgun and a rifle, according to the statement.
Parsons was released Saturday after posting $10,000 bond, according to the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office.
""The initial report stated there was a truckload of militia that was involved. However, after further investigation, it was determined Parsons acted alone and there were no truckloads of militia going to Lake Lure,"" the statement said.
According to SITE Intelligence, which tracks the online activity of extremist organizations, Parsons has promoted the militia group the Three Percenters online.
News of the arrest came one day after the sheriff in Ashe County, NC, about two hours to the north of Rutherford County, said that there had been threats against FEMA employees responding to Hurricane Helene.
""Recently in the mountain region, there have been threats made against them,"" Ashe County Sheriff Phil Howellposted on Facebookregarding the alleged threats against FEMA employees.
""This has not happened in Ashe County or the surrounding counties,"" Howell added. ""Out of an abundance of caution, they have paused their process as they are assessing the threats.""
Sheriff Howell did not specify in his post who allegedly made the threats, nor is it known if Parsons' alleged threat is the one to which Sheriff Howell was referring. An ABC News request for comment sent to the Ashe County Sheriff's Office did not receive an immediate response.
Threats to FEMA employees have been consistent during the Hurricane response, along with misinformation, federal authorities told ABC News.
Search and rescue efforts in the affected areas continue, a federal source told ABC News. However, while FEMA assesses potential threat information, disaster survivor assistance teams are currently working at fixed locations and secure areas instead of going door to door, out of an abundance of caution, the source said, adding that FEMA will monitor threat information and make adjustments to this posture on a regular basis in coordination with local officials.
A FEMA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency continues to support communities impacted by Helene and to help survivors apply for assistance.
""For the safety of our dedicated staff and the disaster survivors we are helping, FEMA has made some operational adjustments,"" the spokesperson said. ""Disaster Recovery Centers will continue to be open as scheduled, survivors continue to register for assistance, and we continue to help the people of North Carolina with their recovery.""
At the direction of North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, the state's Department of Public Safety will assist FEMA conduct their operations.
""We know that significant misinformation online contributes to threats against response workers on the ground, and the safety of responders must be a priority,"" the governor said.  ""At my direction, the North Carolina Department of Public Safety is helping partners like FEMA to coordinate with law enforcement to ensure their safety and security as they continue their important work.""
Sheriff Howell said that FEMA locations in Ashe County are open this week.
""Stay calm and steady during our recovery, help folks and please don't stir the pot,"" he said.
FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told ABC News Friday during a press briefing that threats to FEMA employees are a ""shame"" and a ""distraction.""
""We continuously monitor the social media, channels, other outlets where we're seeing this information, because we want to make sure we're providing for the safest environment for our employees, and making sure that they know that their safety is first and foremost for us as they go out into these communities,"" Criswell said in response to a question from ABC News.
FEMA hires people from local communities when disaster hits, Criswell said, noting that ""many"" leave their families behind to go and help communities who are impacted by disaster.

abcnews,"Harris works to appeal to Black men, a critical group for Democrats",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-works-appeal-black-men-critical-group-democrats/story?id=114780568,"The vice president will continue to court Black men while in Detroit.
For a second day this week, Vice President Kamala Harris is focusing on a key voting bloc that is a critical base for the Democratic Party: Black men.
On Tuesday, Harris will participate in an audio town hall event with Charlemagne tha God, host for the popular ""The Breakfast Club"" podcast. Also on Tuesday, the vice president is meeting with Black entrepreneurs in Detroit.
Her events come a day after her campaign rolled out a comprehensive plan -- just three weeks until the election -- to help Black men ""get ahead"" economically, which includes providing one million fully forgivable loans to Black entrepreneurs and an effort to invest in Black male teachers.
In an interview on ""Roland Martin Unfiltered,"" also released on Monday, Harris argued that economic policies that consider ""historical barriers"" facing Black people benefit all Americans.
""If you have public policy, and I'm talking about economic public policy specifically at this point, but if you have public policy that recognizes historical barriers and what we need to do then to overcome,"" Harris said. ""First, speak truth about them and then overcome them, that in the process of doing that, not only are you directly dealing with the injustices and the legal and procedural barriers that have been focused on Black folks, but by eliminating those barriers, everyone actually benefits, right?""
The focus on Black voters comes afterformer President Barack Obama sternly chided Black menover ""excuses"" to not vote for Harris while speaking to a group of Black at a campaign field office in Pittsburgh's East Liberty neighborhood last week.
""You have [Trump], who has consistently shown disregard, not just for the communities, but for you as a person, and you're thinking about sitting out?"" Obama asked. ""And you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses?""
Harris is polling ahead of Trump with Black voters who are registered to vote, 82-13%, according tothe latest ABC News/Ipsos poll. That compares with 87-12% in the 2020 exit poll (a slight 5 points lower for Harris; no better for Trump). Black men are at 76-18% (compared with 79-19% four years ago), the poll found.
These differences from 2020 aren't statistically significant, and Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock said he agrees.
""I don't buy this idea that there will be huge swaths of Black men voting for Donald Trump. That's not going to happen. What I would urge folks to do is to show up, to understand that if you don't vote, that is a vote for Donald Trump. That's the concern.,"" said Warnock on a Tuesday campaign call with reporters.
Part of the Harris campaign's plan for Black men includes legalizing recreational marijuana nationwide. Such a move would ""break down unjust legal barriers that hold Black men and other Americans back,"" the campaign said in its release.
This takes the Biden administration's current stance, which includes pardoning people convicted of marijuana possession, a step further. For Harris' part, such a proposal is evidence of her evolving position. She has become more progressive since her time as attorney general of California when she was heavily criticized for aggressively prosecuting weed-related crimes.
Asked if she ever smoked by Charlamagne tha God back in 2019, Harris responded, ""I have. And I inhaled -- I did inhale. It was a long time ago. But, yes.""
She went on to clarify that she believes in legalizing the substance.
""I have had concerns, the full record, I have had concerns, which I think -- first of all, let me just make this statement very clear, I believe we need to legalize marijuana,"" she said. ""Now, that being said -- and this is not a 'but,' it is an 'and' -- and we need to research, which is one of the reasons we need to legalize it. We need to move it on the schedule so that we can research the impact of weed on a developing brain. You know, that part of the brain that develops judgment, actually begins its growth at age 18 through age 24.""
Her answer garnered backlash due to her record prosecuting the substance, particularly given the racial disparities in punishment nationwide. Harris' new proposal looks to correct those historical inequities.
But is it enough?
In addition to the new proposals, Harris has aggressively been campaigning in Black communities in the past week, stopping at several local Black-owned businesses and churches in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan as well as appearing on several media programs with predominately Black audiences.
In September, Harris told a group of Black reporters in a moderated conversationhosted by the National Association of Black Journaliststhat she was ""working to earn the vote, not assuming I'm going to have it because I am Black.""
Her campaign launched a ""Black Men Huddle"" organizing call on Monday, which featured remarks from campaign senior officials Tony West, Brian Nelson, Quentin Fulks and Rep. Cedric Richmond. Later, there was a weekly event focused on Black men supporting Harris featuring actor Don Cheadle.
""What the vice president is doing is giving us the tools to be able to go and have meaningful, impactful conversations when Black men turn back around to us and say, 'Well, what's in it for me,' I think that we have policy and tools like this that we can say exactly that,"" said Fulks.
Doc Rivers, whointerviewed Harris for his ""ALL the SMOKE"" podcast on Monday, said he agreed with Obama's comments last week and pushed for Black men to cast their ballots.
""I agree 100% with President Obama -- it's unacceptable not to vote. When you look back at what your parents and your grandparents had to do to get the right to vote, that's unacceptable for me,"" said Rivers. ""But there are Black men who out there that feel hopeless, they don't believe a vote helps them in either way, and I'm here to tell them they're wrong.""
ABC News interviewed Black men in Pittsburgh's predominately Black Homewood Brushton neighborhood last Friday about their impressions of Harris and what she needed to do to get their vote.
Aquail Bey, a student at The Community College of Allegheny County and president of its veterans club, said Harris needs to meet them where they are and genuinely speak with them.
""She's doing a good job right now, but I think she should have -- go to places where they are, you know, meet them on their own terms, you know. Go to the neighborhoods where they are, go to the barber shops ... "" Bey said. ""Wherever the Black men are, go to where they are, speak to them a way that they understand.""
Aaron Stuckey said people shouldn't assume Black men aren't getting behind Harris.
""Just poll us instead of assuming that that's where we're not going,"" he said.

abcnews,Close fight in the trenches: A look at the ground game in the presidential race: POLL,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/close-fight-trenches-ground-game-presidential-race/story?id=114780589,"Harris and Trump are fighting to parity in voter contacts.
A narrow edge in voter contact by Kamala Harris' campaign at the national level fades to parity in the battleground states -- but Harris has been doing more to turn her contacts into voter assistance, an ABC News/Ipsos poll finds.
Three weeks before Election Day, and with early voting underway in more than 40 states, the level of political outreach is vast. More than four in 10 Americans have been contacted by the Harris or Trump campaigns asking for their vote, rising to 62% in the seven battleground states.
Nationally, 30% report having been contacted by Harris' campaign, vs. 26% by Trump's -- a small edge for Harris. This evens out in the battleground states, where 47% report contacts by Trump's campaign, 46% by Harris'. These counts exclude fundraising appeals -- and surely have grown since this survey was completed last week.
See PDF for full results.
In all, 16% of adults have been contacted nationally by Harris' campaign only, 12% by Trump's only and 14% by both, adding to 42%. In the battlegrounds, it's 15% by Trump only, 14% by Harris only and 32% by both.
There's a gap in terms of voter assistance. Nationally, 43% of those contacted by the Harris campaign say they were offered one of several forms of voting assistance, vs. 35% of those contacted by Trump's campaign. In the battleground states, offers of assistance run 48-39% in Harris' favor, a slight advantage given sample sizes.
Forms of assistance tested in the survey include checking that people are registered to vote, confirming their plans to vote and making sure they know where to vote. In the battlegrounds (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin), people contacted by Harris are 8 percentage points more apt than those contacted by Trump to report help making sure they're registered and 7 points more apt to report an effort to confirm they have voted or will vote, both slight differences given sample sizes. Gaps nationally are similar.
This poll, produced byLanger Research Associatesfor ABC, with fieldwork byIpsos, also finds some signs of more targeted outreach by Harris. Nationally, 46% of Democrats have heard from her campaign, vs. 37% of Republicans contacted by the Trump campaign. And 42% of Harris supporters say her campaign has reached out to them, vs. 35% of Trump's supporters contacted by his side.
Similar to Harris' lead on overall contacts, these gaps disappear in the battleground states. That said, among people in these states who report having voted forJoe Bidenin 2020, 71% report a contact by the Harris campaign this year. Among those who voted for Trump in 2020, fewer, 59%, report a 2024 Trump campaign contact.
Naturally, Harris' campaign has had far more contact than Trump's among Democrats and liberals, while Trump's has done more outreach to Republicans and conservatives. National results also demonstrate campaign targeting in other ways. Three examples:


Among people younger than 40 -- a generally pro-Harris group -- 27% report a Harris campaign contact vs. 19% contacted by the Trump campaign.
By contrast, among white evangelical Protestants, a solidly pro-Trump group, 34% have been contacted by the Trump campaign, vs. 16% by Harris'.

There are inefficiencies on both sides. Nationally, 24% of Trump supporters have been contacted by the Harris campaign asking for their vote, and 21% of Harris supporters have been contacted by the Trump campaign. Misplaced outreach rises in the battlegrounds: There, 44% of Harris supporters have been asked for a Trump vote, and 41% of Trump supporters have heard from the Harris campaign.
Using national data for adequate sample sizes, there are several groups in which Harris' campaign exceeds Trump's in offering assistance to people they've contacted. It's 58% among Black people contacted by Harris' campaign vs. 38% among Black people contacted by Trump's. It's 40% among college graduates contacted by Harris vs. 26% among those contacted by Trump. And the Harris campaign has offered assistance to 42% of independents it's contacted, a potential swing voter group, vs. 32% among independents contacted by the Trump campaign.
Text messages are the most common types of outreach, reported by 61% of those who've heard from either or both of the campaigns. That's followed by email, 43%; postal mail, 36%; social media, 25%; and phone or voicemail, 19%.
Last on the list is the kind of outreach many political scientists say is most effective -- in-person contact, reported by 6%.
The distribution of contact types is similar across the two campaigns overall, albeit with more digital outreach by Harris and more by mail from Trump. Nationally, 84% of her contacts report having heard from her campaign by text, email or on social media vs. 77% of Trump's. Trump, for his part, leads on postal mail outreach, 38 vs. 29%. Distributions look largely similar in the battlegrounds, although both campaigns appear to be focusing more on postal mail; 56% of battleground state respondents who have been contacted by either campaign have been contacted via postal mail vs. 36% nationally.
This ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel® Oct. 4-8, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,631 adults. Partisan divisions are 29-29-30%, Democrats-Republicans-independents. Results have a margin ofsampling errorof plus or minus 2 percentage points, including the design effect, for the full sample.

abcnews,Harris calls Trump 'increasingly unstable and unhinged' during Pennsylvania rally,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-calls-trump-increasingly-unstable-unhinged-erie-pennsylvania/story?id=114795103,"Harris played clips of Trump during her campaign stop in Erie on Monday.
Vice PresidentKamala Harrisdeployed a new show-and-tell approach to lambasting former PresidentDonald Trumpat her Monday night rally, playing clips of him calling his opponents the ""enemy within"" and saying that it signaled that he was ""increasingly unstable and unhinged.""
""After all these years, we know who Donald Trump is: He is someone who will stop at nothing to claim power for himself,"" Harris said during her campaign stop in Erie, Pennsylvania.
""And you don't have to take my word for it. I've said, for a while now, watch his rallies, listen to his words,"" she added.
Harris first invited Americans to watch Trump's rallies during the presidential debate hosted by ABC News debate last month.
""He tells us who he is, and he tells us what he would do if he is elected president. So here tonight, I will show you one example of Donald Trump's worldview and intentions,"" Harris said, teeing up the video that played on large monitors at the Erie Insurance Arena.
""The worst people are the enemies from within,"" Trump is seen saying in one clip.
""Now if you had one really violent day, one rough hour, and I mean real rough,"" he says in another.
The presentation marks the introduction of a new element to a Harris rally.
The vice president has quoted Trump's comments before -- as she also did again throughout her speech Monday night -- and has repeatedly asked supporters to watch his events, but she has yet to play a video of them.
""So, you heard his words. You heard his words coming from him. He's talking about the enemy within Pennsylvania. He's talking about the enemy within our country, Pennsylvania,"" Harris said after the clip played.
""He considers anyone who doesn't support him or who will not bend to his will, an enemy of our country,"" Harris warned.
Harris went on to say another Trump term would be ""a huge risk for America and dangerous,"" calling out his positions on reproductive freedoms, climate and LGBTQ+ rights.
The vice president concluded her speech in Pennsylvania with a rallying cry to voters. ""We are all here together because we know what's at stake. And we are here together because we love our country,"" she said.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, for the first time this cycle, will soon hit the campaign trail with former President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton, according to a senior campaign official.
The vice presidential nominee will be out with his party's former standard bearers this week and next week in an effort to push for early voting in battleground states, ABC News has exclusively learned.
The governor will first rally with Clinton in Durham, North Carolina, on Thursday -- the first day of early voting in the critical battleground state. Next Tuesday, Walz will travel to Wisconsin, another battleground, with Obama for the start of early voting in that state.
The joint campaign blitzes come as the Harris-Walz ticket has deployed both former presidents -- some of its strongest political assets -- headed into the final stretch of the election cycle.
Obama hit the trail for the ticket starting on Oct. 10 and has additional stops planned in the run-up toElectionDay, according to the campaign.
His first stop was in battleground Pennsylvania in the Pittsburgh area -- a visit wherehe sternly chided Black menover ""excuses"" to not vote for Harris, saying he finds them sitting out or voting for former President Donald Trump ""not acceptable.""
Obama will also independently hit the campaign trail in the Sun Belt this week, with stops on Friday in Arizona and on Saturday in Nevada -- the first days of early voting in the state.
On Sunday and Monday, Clinton made his trail debut with travel across rural communities in Eastern and South Georgia to encourage Georgians to vote early.
Last night, on the eve ofearly in-person voting in the state, Clinton stumped for the Harris-Walz ticket in battleground Georgia, mounting the stakes of the election and the importance of voting.
""I want you to be happy, and I want you to know that I am here because I believe. I believe, based on my personal knowledge of the job and the candidates, that Kamala Harris will be a fine president,"" he said.
""All we gotta do is show up. If we show up, we'll win,"" Clinton added.
The joint principal campaign events also come as Walz himself has made campaign stops related to early voting. The governor campaigned last week in Phoenix and Tucson on the first day of early voting in Arizona.
""I know you've started voting here in Arizona. It's happening across the country. We can make a difference. And I think just the idea of having an administration building on these strong relationships, this is our opportunity to take this to the next level that we need to do,"" Walz said at event with tribal leaders in Chandler, Arizona last Wednesday.

abcnews,"Arizona counties don't have to do citizenship checks before election, judge rules",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/arizona-counties-wont-forced-citizenship-checks-election-judge-114831464,"Those who sought the checks made their request too close to the election.
PHOENIX --A judge has rejected a request to require Arizona's 15 counties to verify the citizenship of some 42,000 voters registered only to vote in federal elections in the presidential battleground state, concluding those who sought the checks made their request too close to the Nov. 5 election and didn’t have legal standing.
A lawsuit filed on behalf of an Arizona voter and the conservative advocacy group Strong Communities Foundation of Arizona sought a court order requiring county recorders to ask federal authorities to verify the citizenship of those voters.
Arizona requires voters to prove their citizenship to participate in local and state races. Voters who don’t provide proof of citizenship yet still swear they are U.S. citizens are allowed to vote only for president, the U.S. House or Senate.
The lawsuit alleged officials weren’t complying with a 2022 law requiring the cross-checking of registration information with various government databases.
“They (the plaintiffs) have not made a clearcut showing of harm, nor that the action they request is feasible in the midst of a general election,” U.S. District Judge Krissa Lanham wrote in an order issued Friday.
Lanham, a nominee of President Joe Biden, said she was declining to force county recorders to divert resources away from preparing for the election and toward citizenship checks just weeks before Election Day.
The plaintiffs told the court that they intend to appeal the ruling.
America First Legal, which is run by former Donald Trump adviser Stephen Miller and represents the plaintiffs, said in a statement Tuesday that the appeal effort was made “to demand potential illegal aliens and noncitizens are lawfully removed from the Arizona voter rolls.”
Taylor Kinnerup, a spokeswoman for Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, declined to comment on the judge’s order.
The lawsuit alleged it wasn’t enough for county officials to consult the databases and said officials should ask federal authorities to verify the voters’ citizenship status.
After it was pointed out that federal law bars systematic voter-list purges within 90 days of an election, the plaintiffs clarified that they were merely asking that a letter be sent to federal officials inquiring about the citizenship of federal-only voters, according to Lanham. The plaintiffs noted they weren’t seeking the removal of people from voter rolls.
The 42,000 voters at issue in the lawsuit are separate from a much larger group of voters whose citizenship hasn’t been confirmed yet will still be allowed to vote in local, state and federal elections in November, according to the office of Secretary of State Adrian Fontes.
About a month ago, officials uncovered a database error that hadmistakenly designated nearly 98,000 votersas having access to the full ballot, even though their citizenship status hadn’t been confirmed.
Driver licenses issued after 1996 are considered valid documented proof of citizenship, but the system error marked the original batch of voters who had pre-1996 licenses as eligible to vote in state and local elections.
The state Supreme Court concluded those voters, who were already able to vote in the federal races,could vote in state and local racesfor the 2024 general election.
A little more than a week later, the number of misclassified votersjumped from almost 98,000 to around 218,000. Fontes' office has said all people included in the database error remain eligible to vote a full ballot.

Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Republican challenger David McCormick are meeting for their second debate
HARRISBURG, Pa. --Democratic U.S. Sen.Bob Caseyof Pennsylvania and Republican challengerDavid McCormickmeet for their second debate Tuesday evening, with control of the Senate on the line and tens of millions of dollars pouring into the race every week.
During theirfirst debatetwo weeks ago, Casey tried to drive home the message that McCormick is a wealthy,carpetbaggingex-hedge fund CEO whogot richat the expense of Americans and will serve the interests of billionaires.
McCormick painted Casey as a weak, do-nothing out-of-touch career politician who will vote almost 100% of the time with PresidentJoe Bidenand Vice PresidentKamala Harris.
Mail-in voting has already begun in the pivotal swing-state seat, and the outcome of this race, one of the nation’s most expensive, could help determine which party controls the narrowly divided Senate.
Casey, perhaps Pennsylvania’s best-known politician, is seeking a fourth term in what he calls his toughest reelection challenge yet.
Casey, 64, supported Biden's major initiatives, including his$1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, and is a staunch ally of labor unions. The former state auditor general and treasurer has won six statewide elections and is Pennsylvania’s longest-serving Democrat in the Senate. He has campaigned on preserving the middle class,abortion rights, labor rights and voting rights — and calls McCormick and former PresidentDonald Trumpa threat to all those.
McCormick, 59, is making his second run for the Senate afterlosing narrowlyto Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022’s Republican primary. He was CEO of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, sat on Trump’s Defense Advisory Board and served in top positions under President George W. Bush. Those included posts as a Commerce undersecretary tasked with policy over controlling exports of sensitive technologies and a Treasury undersecretary as the administration tried to prevent bank failures during the recession.
McCormick backs Trump's pledge to extend the tax cuts he signed into law in 2017 and to carry out a mass deportation of immigrants who are in the country without permission — prioritizing people with criminal records. McCormick also opposes abortion rights, but said he wouldn't vote for a national ban on abortion.
Issues aroundborder policyand theIsrael-Hamas warare prominent in the race.
Democrats currently hold a Senate majority by the narrowest of margins, but facea difficult 2024 Senate map.
More than $190 million has been spent on this single race so far, according disclosures to the Federal Election Commission. The total is on track to exceed $320 million, based on campaign ad tracking by AdImpact, which includes spots reserved between now and Election Day.
The 60-minute debate will air starting at 7 p.m., hosted byWPVI-TV in Philadelphia, which will broadcast it live.Univision 65in Philadelphia will simulcast it with Spanish language translation. Both stations will stream it live online, as willABC News Liveand Univision'sVIX.
Both Casey and McCormickwere uncontestedfor their party’s nominations. Also on the ballot in this race are John Thomas of the Libertarian Party, Leila Hazou of the Green Party and Marty Selker of the Constitution Party. They were not invited to the debate.

abcnews,"Economic discontent, issue divisions add up to tight presidential contest: POLL",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/economic-discontent-issue-divisions-add-tight-presidential-contest/story?id=114723390,"Harris has 50% support to Trump’s 48% among likely voters, the poll finds.
Dreary economic attitudes and sharply divergent views on social policies mark the 2024 presidential election, contributing to a tighter contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump: Just 2 percentage points now divide them in a new ABC News/Ipsos poll.
Harris has 50% support to Trump's 48% among likely voters in the national survey, with a similar 49-47% result among all registered voters. (Among all adults, regardless of registration status, it's a single-point race, 49-48%, excluding those who wouldn't vote.)
The results are slightly closer than Harris' +5 points among likely voters and the general public, and +4 among registered voters, in the last ABC/Ipsos poll in mid-September. A gain for Trump among men -- he's now +8 points among those registered to vote -- is a factor, as is a slip for Harris among independents, often swing voters.
See PDF for full results.
Beneath the horse race, issues pull in opposite directions. The poll, produced for ABC News byLanger Research Associates, with fieldwork by Ipsos, finds that 56% of Americans now favor deporting all undocumented immigrants, up 20 points from eight years ago. That reinforces one of Trump's strongest issues, with a 10-point Trump lead in trust to handle immigration at the southern border.
Yet the same share, 56%, side with Harris on abortion, saying the federal government should restore access to what it was before the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. Many fewer, 41%, favor Trump's view that each state should decide. It follows that abortion is Harris' best issue in this poll, with a 15-point lead over Trump in trust on it.
Then there's the economy, and related to it, a sharp division on the nation's future. As reportedFriday, 44% of Americans say they're not as well off now as they were when Biden took office, tying the most negative number on this question in data since 1986.
Further, while inflation has eased and employment is strong, those gains haven't hit home for most people: 59% say the economy is getting worse, more than twice as many as say it's getting better, 23%. And among registered voters who say the economy's worsening, Trump leads Harris by a sweeping 53 points, 74-21%.
Largely informed by economic attitudes, registered voters divide, 51-47%, on whether America's best days are still ahead, or behind it. This in turn relates to candidate choice: Trump, with his message of national decay, leads Harris by 27 points, 61-34%, among those who say the country's best days are behind it. Harris, with her more optimistic messaging, leads Trump by 28 points, 63-35%, among those who think America's best days are ahead.
Taken another way, 59% of Trump's supporters say the country's best days are behind it. Among Harris supporters, 67% say the country's best days are still to come.
Trump leads Harris by 8 points overall in trust to handle the economy and 7 points on inflation, consistent results since August that are central to his competitiveness and reflect Harris' challenges breaking free from dissatisfaction with Biden's economic stewardship. (See more on this inFriday's reporton Harris' headwinds as an agent of change.)
That said, Harris pushes back on another economic benchmark, ""looking out for the middle class."" A new item in this poll, she leads Trump on it by 5 points, 42-37%. (The rest don't trust either of them to handle it.)
A test of three economic proposals from each candidate fills out the story: Trump has both the most popular and the least popular proposals, with Harris winning the second, third and fourth slots of the six.
Specifically, Trump's suggestion to end income taxes on Social Security benefits leads in popularity, followed by three from Harris -- a tax credit for middle- and lower-income families with newborns, a limit on the profits food companies can make on groceries and grants to first-time home buyers. Two more Trump proposals come next -- raising tariffs on foreign imports, and the one that is unpopular among most people, cutting corporate income taxes.
One of these -- the idea to end taxes on Social Security benefits -- rises to the level of majority ""strong"" support, 55%. Harris' three proposals also get more strong support than strong opposition, by 10 to 23 points. Trump's remaining items, by contrast, get much less strong support -- and cutting corporate income taxes is more apt to be strongly opposed.
In trust on other issues, Trump holds single-digit leads on handling crime and safety, national security and the conflict in the Middle East; Harris has a single-digit lead on ""protecting American democracy."" Results for items repeated from past polls are virtually unchanged.
While potential voters are closely divided on many points, enthusiasm and personal favorability are two areas in which Harris has clear advantages. Among registered voters who support her, 84% say they're enthusiastic about it; among Trump supporters, enthusiasm drops by 6 points, to 78%. That's markedly lower than enthusiasm for Trump -- 93% -- at this point in 2020.
Enthusiasm is related to personal favorability, and 44% of Americans see Harris favorably, vs. 35% for Trump. Harris' favorability rating lost 3 points in this poll, and 47% now see her unfavorably. That said, many more, 58%, have an unfavorable opinion of Trump.
Favorability isn't determinative. Trump has been underwater in favorability consistently since 2015 -- but won the Electoral College eight years ago regardless.
One important boost to Trump is that, among the 15% of registered voters who see both candidates unfavorably, he leads by a wide margin, 62-24%. Looking at it another way, 21% of Trump's supporters see him unfavorably, but support him anyway. The corresponding figure for Harris is just 7%.
Trump also continues to score a few points by portraying Harris as too liberal. Forty-eight percent of Americans see her this way, vs. 43% who call Trump too conservative. That said, 7% call Harris too conservative and 9% call Trump too liberal; at the end of the day, very similar numbers call them ""about right"" ideologically, 43% for Trump, 41% for Harris.
However much they're liked or disliked, another result shows that most people are ready to hear more from the candidates: 57% say Harris and Trump should agree to an additional televised debate, while 41% say not.
Trump reiterated last week that another debate is not in the cards. And there's a difference on the question between their supporters. Among registered voters who prefer Harris, 71% are looking for another debate, while among those who prefer Trump, this drops sharply, to 45%. (After their sole debate last month, 58% overall thought Harris had won it.)
With the election close to three weeks away, partisanship infuses survey results. Eighty-five percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the economy is getting worse, for instance, while just 32% of Democrats and Democratic leaners agree. In another example, Republicans and GOP leaners are far more apt than their Democratic counterparts to say the country's best days have passed, 60% vs. 36%.
Policy preferences show similar patterns. Eighty-eight percent of Republicans support mass deportation, as do 58% of independents, compared with 26% of Democrats. (That said, support for deportations has increased broadly compared with a 2016 survey, with the exception of views among Democrats and liberals.)
On abortion, partisan divisions results are reversed: Eighty-seven percent of Democrats say the federal government should restore abortion access, as do 57% of independents, dropping to 27% of Republicans.
Polls are best used not to recite who's ahead, but to assess how and why the country is coming to its decision. It's also important to keep in mind that the ultimate winner of the popular vote may differ from the winner of the presidency, as demonstrated in 2016 and 2000 (and likewise, for history buffs, in 1888, 1876 and 1824).
With Election Day drawing close and early voting underway, this poll includes slight departures from previous ABC/Ipsos polls this cycle in measuring vote preferences. Survey respondents are offered up to five candidates -- Harris, Trump, Jill Stein, Chase Oliver and Cornel West, and their running mates -- based on which of those candidates are on the ballot in the state where the respondent lives. (Robert F. Kennedy Jr., while on the ballot in 30 states and the District of Columbia, is not listed, since he's not actively running. Respondents can volunteer their support for Kennedy or anyone else.)
In addition to being asked whom they'd support, respondents are given the option of saying they already voted. In this survey 1% had done so, a number likely to ramp up quickly.
As mentioned, one shift in this poll is the result among men who are registered to vote -- 52-44% in Trump's favor, compared with a dead heat, 48-48%, in mid-September. That includes a 19-point Trump lead among white men and a close contest among Hispanic men and younger men (age 18-39) alike.
A slight change is among independents, who, per exit polls, have voted for the winner in nine out of the last 12 presidential elections. Harris led among independents by 10 points, 51-41%, in mid-September, compared with a non-significant 5 points now, 49-44%.
Harris, for her part, continues to lead among women by 9 points, 53-44%, aided by her showing among under-40, Black and Hispanic women. And she leads by 14 points among college graduates, 56-42%, among the more reliable groups for turnout.
The 17-point gender gap between the candidates (Trump +8 among men, Harris +9 among women) is back to its typical level; it has averaged 19 points in exit polls since 1996. This reflects the fact that women are 8 points more apt than men to identify as Democrats.
The contest stands at 82-13%, Harris-Trump, among Black people who are registered to vote; that compares with 87-12% in the 2020 exit poll (a slight 5 points lower for Harris; no better for Trump). Black women are at 87-10% now (compared with 90-9% in 2020); Black men are at 76-18% (compared with 79-19% four years ago). These differences from 2020 aren't statistically significant.
Then there's the division of votes by state groupings. In what are thought to be safely and likely red states, Trump is comfortably ahead, 55-42%. In expected blue states, Harris is well ahead, 56-39%. And in the seven battleground states where the contest is expected to be close -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- it couldn't be closer: 49% for Harris, 49% for Trump.

abcnews,Vance stands by Trump's false claims Venezuelan gangs have invaded Colorado,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/vance-stands-trumps-false-claims-venezuelan-gangs-aurora/story?id=114751512,"The Republican mayor of the city has said the claims are grossly exaggerated.
GOP vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance is standing by former PresidentDonald Trump'sfalse claims that Venezuelan gangs have invaded and conquered Aurora, Colorado.
Trump has repeatedly claimed that members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang have ""taken over"" apartment complexes and ""overrun"" the city, as he did in arally in the cityon Friday.
Mike Coffman, the Republican mayor of Aurora, said Trump's claims are ""grossly exaggerated"" and ""have unfairly hurt the city's identity and sense of safety.""
Asked by ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday if he supports Trump making those claims, Vance did not back down.
""Well, Martha, you just said the mayor said they were exaggerated. That means there's got to be some element of truth here,"" Vance said.""
Raddatz followed up with Vance, saying the issues in Aurora were limited to a handful of apartment complexes and that the mayor released a statement saying the city's ""dedicated police officers have acted on those concerns and will continue to do so.""
Vance responded, saying Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris caused the issues in Aurora.
""Unfortunately, when you let people in by the millions, most of whom are unvetted, most of whom you don't know who they really are, you're going to have problems like this.""
""Kamala Harris, 94 executive orders that undid Donald Trump's successful border policies. We knew this stuff would happen. Bragged about opening the border, and now we have the consequences, and we're living with it. We can do so much better, but frankly, we're not going to do better, Martha, unless Donald Trump calls this stuff out. I'm glad that he did.""
In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which devastated parts of states in the southeastern U.S., including Florida, North Carolina, and Georgia,Trump has falsely suggestedthat aid from FEMA meant for the hurricane was going to migrants and that the federal government is going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas.
Asked if he believed that true, Vance defended the president.
""What the President said is that fundamentally, FEMA aid is distracted by going to illegal migrants,"" Vance responded. ""We've got Republican congressmen who are on the ground who represent that area saying that they have to call the White House to get food and water to FEMA? I don't, frankly, think there's anything malicious going on here, Martha, but I do think that we've had an incompetent response to this particular crisis, particularly in Western North Carolina, which, to be fair, was hit harder than a lot of us expected it.""
Vance called the federal government's response to the crisis incompetent, saying members of the military are still ""trickling"" into western North Carolina.
Raddatz pushed back against the false claims that the government is not assisting people in Republican areas and citing Pentagon officials who said that active duty troops were staged and ready to go before being called upon and were instantly out the door.
On Friday in Georgia, Vance said that the attorney general is the second-most important government role after the president.
Raddatz pressed Vance if Trump would go after his political opponents if he won another term.
""No, he was president for four years, and he didn't go after his political opponents. You know, who did go after her political opponents? Kamala Harris, who has tried to arrest everything from pro-life activists to her political opponents,"" Vance said.
To follow up, Raddatz told Vance that Trump has said in the past that those who have cheated will be prosecuted.
""Well, he said that people who violated our election laws will be prosecuted. I think that's the administration of law,"" Vance said. ""He didn't say people are going to go to jail because they disagree with me.""
Vance continues to refuse to acknowledge that Trump lost the 2020 election. In an interview with ""This Week"" earlier this year, Vance said he wouldn't have certified the results of the 2020 race until states submitted pro-Trump electors.
Raddatz pressed Vance again on the 2020 election.
""In interview after interview, question after question, and in the debate, you refuse to say that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election,"" Raddatz said. ""So I'm just going to assume that if I ask you 50 times whether he lost the election, you would not acknowledge that he did. Is that correct?""
""Martha, you've you asked this question. I've been asked this question 10 times in the past couple of weeks. Of course, Donald Trump and I believe there were problems in 2020,"" Vance said.
Pressed again by Raddatz, Vance replied, ""I've said repeatedly I think the 2020 election had problems. You want to say rigged? You want to say he won? Use whatever vocabulary term you want.""

LAS VEGAS --Vice PresidentKamala Harriswas asked to name three virtues that her opponent in next month's election,Donald Trump, possesses — but was unable to come up with even one.
At the end of hertown hall for Spanish-language network Univisionin Las Vegas on Thursday, audience member Teresa Djedjro, 48 and originally born in Mexico, asked Harris to, ""Please give me three virtues that Trump has.”
Harris laughed and thanked her for the question before saying, “I know that the vast majority of us has so much more in common than what separates us.” Then she made clear that is not the case for herself and the former president, saying Trump's approach to politics, “pains me” while singling out his ”us versus them” approach.
“I don’t think that's healthy for our nation, and I don’t admire that,"" Harris said. ""And I’m quite critical of it, coming from someone who wants to be president of the United States.”
Taking another stab at a compliment, she offered, “I think Donald Trump loves his family and I think that’s very important,"" only to continue, ""But I don’t really know him. I only met him one time ... so I don’t really have much more to offer you.”
Trump is holding his own Univision town hall next week, after the original gathering in Miami was postponed due to Hurricane Milton. Still, he too has had little nice to say about Harris during the campaign, calling her “mentally impaired.”

abcnews,Trump outpaces Harris and Walz in campaign events as Election Day approaches,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-outpaces-harris-walz-campaign-events-run-final/story?id=113932634,"In September, Trump held 21 public events compared to Harris' 13.
As former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris spend the run-up to the last stretch of the 2024 election barnstorming through battleground states, a contrast has emerged: Trump has single-handedly outpaced both Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in campaign events for the month of September as he shows no signs of slowing down -- a strategy his campaign is employing to focus on counties vulnerable to flipping.
In September, Trump held 21 public campaign events including remarks, rallies, press conferences and town halls. That's compared to Harris' 13 campaign events; Walz had seven campaign events, according to campaign schedules ABC News has reviewed. On top of Trump's jam-packed campaign schedule, his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, alone held 14 events in the month of September.
These tallies do not include brief campaign retail stops and appearances without remarks.
The intensity in Trump's campaign schedule has continued into the first week of October. From Oct. 1 through Oct. 6, Trump has already held eight campaign events compared to Harris, who has held two, according to an ABC News review of their schedules.
Recently Harris has spent her days focused on her official duties as vice president receiving Federal Emergency Management Agency briefings and surveying Hurricane Helene's damage in Georgia and North Carolina. Trump similarly visited Georgia to survey the storm damage and received his own briefings from local officials.
Harris campaign advisers have dismissed arguments that Harris isn't campaigning hard enough, pointing to the eight events she had done throughout the month in her official capacity as vice president including a trip down to the southern border along with dealing with the devastation from Hurricane Helene.
Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement that Trump is ""cocooned in a conservative media bubble"" and ""limiting his time in battleground states,"" while Harris and Walz are ""taking tough questions and meeting voters where they are.""
""In the home stretch, Donald Trump is campaigning in California, Chicago, and New York City, after camping out at Mar-A-Lago avoiding voters,"" Chitika wrote in the statement.
However, in recent weeks, Trump has been campaigning across multiple battleground states, which have included multiple appearances in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina, as he enters a crucial phase of his campaign and vies to make a final pitch to voters ahead of Election Day.
""I go to a lot of places, we're definitely outworking the opposition. She'll go to one place in three days. I say, 'Why can't I do that?'"" Trump quipped at a campaign stop in Savannah, Georgia, late last month.
Earlier this election cycle, Trump was falling behind in the number of campaign events compared to his nonstop rallying during the 2016 election. Trump, who had early victories in primary races, had fewer events amid his legal battles, which kept him confined in a courtroom most days of the week.
But he has picked up the pace in the final months ahead of the election.
The former president has spent most of his time in the past month in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, holding four events in September there as polling shows it's the closest state on the map between the two candidates. Harris only has a 0.4% lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, according to538's polling average.
Trump's events have been concentrated in urban-suburban areas in battleground states that flipped between his two presidential runs as his campaign hopes to eat away at Democratic margins.
For example, last month, Trump gave remarks at a manufacturing plant in Walker, Michigan, in Kent County -- a county that President Joe Biden flipped from Trump in 2020. Later in the day, Trump hosted a town hall in Warren, Michigan, which sits just outside of Detroit and was the only county in 2020 in the tri-county region that flipped to Trump in the past two cycles after former President Barack Obama won the county in 2008 and 2012.
Two weeks ago, Trump visited Prairie Du Chien in Crawford County, Wisconsin -- a southwest county in the state that is among several in the region that flipped from Obama to Trump. Now, Trump is trying to win back voters in these pivotal counties after he narrowly lost the state to Biden by 21,000 votes in 2020.
Last week, Trump marked his fourth visit to Wisconsin in eight days with events in Milwaukee and Dane counties -- two Democratic strongholds. He went on to campaign on Sunday in Juneau, Wisconsin, in Dodge County -- a county that has increasingly been turning into a Republican stronghold over the last few presidential elections.
Harris has similarly focused on Pennsylvania, holding five events in the commonwealth. She has spent much of her time in Western and central Pennsylvania, drawing crowds from both the Democratic-leaning Pittsburgh area as well as rural counties that have been wavering between strong and slight Republican leanings.
The schedule contrast comes as the Harris campaign, and previously Biden's, have been critical of Trump's slow pace on the road earlier in the cycle, arguing he was campaigning from ""his country club basement.""
In the early weeks of August, on the heels of Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 election, Trump only had a smattering of events in Republican-safe states, spending most of his time at private fundraisers and participating in online interviews including with tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and streamer Adin Ross.
Harris began introducing herself to the nation by holding multiple events in the beginning weeks of her campaign and drawing big crowds from that momentum -- especially in the second week of August when the Harris-Walz ticket held five joint rallies across the country -- but has since failed to keep up with that pace. At times, Harris has focused on her official duties as vice president instead or simply had no public campaign or vice presidential schedules announced.
Additionally, Harris and Walz have both received public scrutiny for their careful campaigning methods, both largely avoiding media availability on the road and sit-down interviews, something the Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance both routinely do.
Recently, however, the Harris-Walz campaign has announced a series of media interviews including appearances on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, ABC's ""The View,"" CBS News' ""60 Minutes,"" and the ""Howard Stern Show"" for Harris. Walz is set to do interviews on the ""Smartless"" podcast and ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" this week.
Thelatest polling average from 538shows Harris is gaining momentum nationally, leading Trump by 2.6%, but a recentNew York Times/Siena College pollshows a tighter race with the two candidates neck-and-neck among registered voters in Michigan and Wisconsin. AnotherNew York Times/Siena College polla week prior showed Trump leading in the battleground states of Arizona and North Carolina.
As he enters the final stages of the campaign, Trump has publicly acknowledged the importance of the last weeks of his campaign, often telling his supporters that he isn't taking anything for granted. Trump's campaign has said the former president is aware of the stakes of the election as he enters the final stages and hopes his message on immigration and economy -- two key issues for voters this election -- resonate.
Trump has said he plans to leave everything on the field as Election Day draws near.
""We're going to leave nothing to chance and everything on the field … and we're going to defeat Kamala Harris, and we're going to make America great again,"" Trump said at a campaign stop in Waunakee, Wisconsin, last week.
Harris, going into the final stretch of the election, has stressed that she's running as an ""underdog"" in what's shaping up to be a close race.
""This is a margin-of-error race. We are the underdog. And I am running like the underdog because I am the underdog in this race. The baton is now in our hands,"" Harris said at a fundraiser in San Francisco in late September.
While falling behind Trump in formal campaign remarks, the Harris campaign has filled their schedule for both candidates with retail campaign stops, seeing value in fostering environments where their candidates can have more face time with voters, as well as fundraisers that has allowed them to wipe out Trump's campaign money edge from earlier this year.

President Bidentravels to his native state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday, as he serves as the main attraction at the Philadelphia Democratic City Committee's autumn fundraising dinner.
And first lady Jill Biden will be in suburban Philadelphia – as she headlines an afternoon event in Chester County and then speaks in the evening in Montgomery County, where she grew up.
The first lady is campaigning on behalf of Harris in the seven key swing states whose razor-thin margins decided her husband's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine if Harris or Trump succeed Biden in the White House.

Biden's latest campaign trail foray for fellow Democrats comes amid reports of a lack of coordination between political advisers to the president and the vice president.
TENSIONS ALLEGEDLY RISE BETWEEN BIDEN AND HARRIS AIDES
The appearances by both Bidens also come a day after the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees campaignedin Pennsylvania, with Harris holding two events in Erie, in the northwest corner of the state, and Trump in suburban Philadelphia, in the southeastern portion of the commonwealth.

It was the vice president's 10th visit to Pennsylvania since replacing Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in mid-July. Trump's also been a frequent visitor, with rallies in Scranton and Reading less than a week ago.
Pennsylvania, along with Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada, had razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump. And the seven states will likely determine whether Harris or Trump wins the 2024presidential election.

But with 19 electoral votes at stake, Pennsylvania's the biggest of the key battlegrounds.

foxnews,Trump says GOP is 'party of common sense' during contentious Bloomberg interview,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-gop-party-common-sense-during-contentious-bloomberg-interview,"Former President Trump details his foreign policy and trade policies on ‘Sunday Morning Futures.’
Former President Trump said theRepublican Partyis ""the party of common sense"" Tuesday during a contentious interview with Bloomberg News in Chicago.
Trump sat for an interview with Bloomberg News’ editor-in-chief John Micklethwait at the Economic Club of Chicago. The two discussed Trump’s plans forthe economyin a potential second term during a heated interview that lasted nearly an hour.
Micklethwait spoke about the economy to start, but later got into the state of the presidential race, asking the former president which state he believed was most critical to deciding the election.

TRUMP REVEALS WHICH ELECTION ISSUE IS A 'BIGGER DEAL' THAN INFLATION AND THE ECONOMY
""They say Pennsylvania. I think we’re doing very well there. I think you look at Michigan, too, and I’m doing very well,"" Trump said. ""We’re way up in Pennsylvania. We’re way up in Michigan. We’re doing very well in Arizona. In fact, somebody said they’re going to pull the plug in Arizona – they’re going to give it up because it looks like we’re quite a ways ahead.""
A RealClearPolitics polling average as of Tuesday afternoon showed Trump slightly ahead in Pennsylvania, as well as in Arizona and Michigan.
Trump went on to say that the Republican Party is ""the party of common sense.""
""Forget about conservative, liberal. We’re, let’s say, conservative, but we’re really a party of ‘We need borders. We need fair elections. We don’t want men playing in women’s sports. We don’t want transgender operations without parental consent,’"" Trump explained. ""It is 99.9% common sense. It really is common sense. I say we’re really a party of common sense, and we want to have great people in our country.""
Trump added: ""I have a good heart. I have a heart where I want people to be taken care of. But I don’t want to take in people where millions of people – 21 million people at least have come in the last three and a half years unvetted, unchecked. We don’t know anything about them.""

Micklethwait began Tuesday's interview by claiming Trump’s economic plan would drive up debt and inflation, with the former president claiming that he served in office without inflation.
""Yeah, I had four years – no inflation,"" Trump said.
Micklethwait also hit Trump on his plan for tariffs on foreign goods, but Trump fired back, explaining that foreign countries will pay a ""100% tariff on everything sold into the United States.""
FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS LOSES HER LEAD AND A NEW ELECTORATE EMERGES
Earlier this year, Trump rolled out a plan to eliminateChina's most favored nation trade statusand impose universal baseline 10% tariffs on imports. In private, Trump has even floated tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese goods. Economists have warned that increasing tariffs would also cause an increase in prices for everyday goods due to American companies relying on cheap raw materials from China.
Micklethwait said Trump’s plans would ""have a serious effect on the overall economy.""
""It’s going to have a massive effect – positive effect. It’s going to be a positive effect,"" Trump replied. ""It must be hard for you to spend 25 years talking about tariffs as being negative and then have somebody explain to you that you’re totally wrong.""
Micklethwait fired back at Trump, saying he could be ""plunging America into the biggest trade war.""
""No, there are no tariffs – all you have to do is build your plant in the United States and you don't have any tariffs,"" Trump said. ""That's what I want.""
The former president's response was met with applause from the audience.
""The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States and build a factory in the United States so it doesn't have to pay the tariff,"" Trump explained.
As for national security and foreign policy, Trump touted his relationships with adversaries, like Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying the United States was respected under his administration.
Trump was asked if he would send American troops to defend Taiwan if China invaded. The Chinese military are currently engaged in rehearsals for a naval blockade of the island nation.
""The reason they're doing it now is because they're not going to do it afterward,"" Trump said – a response met with applause from the audience.
Trump was also asked if he has spoken to Putin since he left office, to which he replied: ""I don’t comment on that.""

Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., shares new details about an Afghanistan national allegedly tied to an Election Day terror plot and discusses his swing state tour.
Lawmakers are raising new concerns about potential terror threats after the arrest of an Afghan national accused of planningan Election Dayattack. On""Fox & Friends""Tuesday, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., raised concerns about the vetting process for foreign nationals, warning ""thousands"" of individuals were ""rushed"" over in the wake of the Biden-Harris administration's botched Afghanistan withdrawal.
AFGHAN CHARGED WITH ELECTION DAY TERROR PLOT RAISES QUESTIONS, FEARS FROM LAWMAKERS: ‘THIS IS REAL’
SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN:I was briefed a few weeks prior to this, not by the FBI, but from a different agency. What we understood is this individual was vulnerable to touch points, meaning that they were accepted in on an SIV, special immigration visa, but there's confusion if he was prior or after the withdrawal. We believe that he was rushed with an SIV after the disastrouswithdrawal from Afghanistan,and it wasn't proper vetting to actually say he was an SIV. The issue that we have here is there's thousands of individuals that [were] rushed over here because of the Harris-Biden withdrawal, and they weren't properly vetted. And when you don't probably vet them, you don't know what their touch points – touch points mean their vulnerabilities –  vulnerabilities mean what can be leveraged against the individual to make them turn on their host country like this individual did. Fortunately, the FBI was doing their job. They did it correctly that no one was actually at harm, but they caught the individual.How many individuals are out therethat we're not paying attention to?

Authorities announced last week the arrest ofNasir Ahmad Tawhedi, an Afghan nationalwho came to the U.S. in 2021 after the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Tawhedi is charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS and receiving a firearm to be used to commit a felony or a federal crime of terrorism.
Authorities say he liquidated his family's assets to finance his plan, including purchasing rifles and one-way tickets for his wife and child back to Afghanistan.
""This defendant, motivated by ISIS, allegedly conspired to commit a violent attack, on Election Day, here on our homeland,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray in a statement.

Court filings initially stated that he came on a special immigrant visa but have since clarified that he came to the U.S. via humanitarian parole and later applied for SIV status.
A senior administration officialtold Fox News last week that Tawhedi was screened three times. He was screened first to work security for the CIA in Afghanistan, then for humanitarian parole to enter the U.S. in 2021, when he was vetted and screened in a third country, and then for special immigrant status, for which he was approved. His status has not yet been finalized. Officials believe he was radicalized after coming to the U.S.

More than 230 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals are calling on former President Trump to release his medical records afterVice President Kamala Harrisdid so.
In anopen letterdated Oct. 13, first reported by CBS News, the health care providers raise concerns about Trump's advanced age and argue that the 78-year-old Republican nominee should be transparent about his health and medical history.
""On August 20, Donald Trump said he would ‘very gladly’ release his medical records. In the 55 days since, he has yet to do so,"" the letter states. ""With no recent disclosure of health information from Donald Trump, we are left to extrapolate from public appearances. And on that front, Trump is falling concerningly short of any standard of fitness for office and displaying alarming characteristics of declining acuity.""
Most of the signatories support Harris for president. The letter asserts that Trump appears to ""ramble, meander, and crudely lash out at his many perceived grievances"" during his campaign events and questions whether this behavior is the result of cognitive changes associated with old age.

""The American people deserve to have confidence in their elected officials' mental and physical capacity to do the jobs that they've elected them to do. Trump ought to be going above and beyond to provide transparency on his physical health and mental acuity, given his advancing age.""
The letter comes while Harris is goading Trump into releasing his health information after the White House put out a ""Healthcare Statement"" on Saturday that declared her to be in ""excellent health.""

Thestatement from Harris' doctoralso indicated she had her most recent annual physical exam in April of this year. Trump released his own health records while campaigning in 2016, and once he took over the White House he continued the trend. In August, with the 2024 election quickly approaching, Trump told CBS News that he would release updated medical records to the public. However, he has yet to do so, with roughly three weeks until Election Day.
""He won't put out his medical records,"" Harris said Monday morning during an interview with podcast host Roland Martin. She also slammed Trump for refusing to debate a second time and questioned why Trump's ""staff"" would not allow him to do an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" particularly when it is tradition for both presidential candidates to do a sit down with the show.

The Trump campaign responded by pointing out several times the former president has voluntarily released updates about his health. They also noted that he sharedrecords from a July screeningconducted by Dr. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician turned GOP congressman, following the second assassination attempt on his life.

A hearing was held Tuesday in akey Georgia county’slawsuit against the State Elections Board (SEB), roughly three weeks until voters head to the polls on Nov. 5.
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney is overseeing the case filed by the Cobb County Board of Elections earlier this month. The bipartisan board is taking issue with a set of new rules imposed by the SEB, including a measure to require county election workers tohand count ballotsafter polls close to ensure accurate machine tabulation.
The rule has also sparked a lawsuit filed by Georgia Democratic officials, which is set for a hearing on Wednesday.
Cobb County is a majority suburban area anchored by the city of Marietta, a suburb of Atlanta.

During the Tuesday hearing, attorneys for the SEB argued that there were no limitations on when election rules can be passed and pointed out that the specific hand-counting rule applies only to the ballots themselves, not tallying individual votes cast on the ballots.
""All we are doing is saying, you need to [have] receipts of votes cast, mirror the number that the machine says were cast,"" the lawyer said.
But McBurney noted that it was ""late in the game"" for the SEB to change election rules but also conceded that, in a vacuum, wanting to ensure that the number of ballots cast matched the machine-count was a ""laudable goal.""

""Why wouldn’t we just pause, especially on the hand-count rule, given what looks like a fairly robust record of chaos that it is sowing?"" the judge asked the defendants’ lawyer.
""I'm asking you from a practical perspective, if the goal is orderly, reliable elections, why the prudent — in terms of reasonableness approach — wouldn't be to say, 'Let's try this next election,' when all those questions can be answered with no one having to sue?""

Republican Party officials have held the rule up as a critical guardrail to ensuring voters can be confident in their elections, but Democrats contend that its goal is to foment doubt in the process.
The Cobb County lawsuit argued the rules put elections boards across the state in ""an untenable position.""
An attorney in support of the plaintiffs later pointed out the state officials who have come out in opposition to the rules changes, including Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.
""All of them are concerned about the impact of this rule,"" the lawyer said.
TRUMP VS HARRIS ROUND 2? VOTERS IN KEY GA COUNTY REVEAL IF THEY WANT SECOND DEBATE
""It would be one thing in an ideal sterile environment to have people who are fresh and energized sit down and count ballots… That's not how this is going to play out. In reality, as our petitioner affidavits reference, poll workers get to their polls as early as 5 a.m., 5:30, 6 a.m. They stay as late as 8 p.m., 10 p.m. And so we're talking about adding something on top of an already 14- to 16-hour day when people are exhausted.""
McBurney pointed out that it could then be done the next day, to which the attorney responded, ""But then there are challenges that come with that as well, Your Honor.""
The judge said the hand-counting ballots rule ""does not directly interfere with the certification work going on"" but that it ""will be a resource drain, no question.""
But the SEB attorney later criticized the plaintiffs’ arguments as conjecture.
""All that it says over and over again is, quote, ‘I am concerned about the rule’s last minute adoption….I am concerned that the Cobb County Elections Office lacks space. I am concerned that the hand-count rule may lead to delays,"" he said.

""It is hypothetical on top of conjecture, on top of speculation. There is no imminent threat here. There is a threat of potential things that might happen if the worst-case scenario comes up, and that's simply not sufficient for declaratory judgment.""
McBurney heard the case the same day as he issued a decision in a separate Georgia elections case, ruling that county elections supervisors are not allowed to delay certification of results on the grounds of their own suspicions of fraud or mistakes.

One of Trump’s co-defendants had sued to have Willis and Wade disqualified from the case, arguing their relationship presented a conflict of interest and that they financially benefited from the probe – which they have denied.
A Fulton County judge ruled in March that Willis could stay on the case if Wade was removed.
Fox News Digital reached out to the House Judiciary Committee for comment on Wade's deposition.

foxnews,'Ruining our car industry': Biden-Harris EV regs prove flashpoint in Michigan Senate debate,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ruining-our-car-industry-biden-harris-ev-regs-prove-flashpoint-michigan-senate-debate,"Mike Rogers emphasized the importance of his latest endorsement in the Michigan Senate race, as farmers back the Republican over his Democrat foe.
Former Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., and Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., traded blows on electric vehicle mandates and border security during their Senate debate in the criticalswing state of Michigan.
""It's ruining our car industry,"" Rogers said of mandates related to buying and producing electric vehicles (EV) during Monday’s debate, starting one of the most heated exchanges of the event. ""You're promoting Chinese technology in America.""
The two candidates in Michigan’s critical Senate race have sparred over the issue of EV mandates throughout the campaign, highlighting how critical the issue is in a state that will play a major role in deciding thepresidential electionand control of the federal legislature.
Rogers has attempted through two debates in the race to tie President Biden and the Democratic Party’s support for EVs to Slotkin, who has countered that her support for the technology will ensure that Michigan remains competitive in the future of auto manufacturing.

Rogers said Democrats such as Slotkin are ""killing the car business"" when it comes to promoting EVs, accusing his opponent of voting for a ""mandate"" on EVs ""at least three times.""
While there has been no mandate that Americans must purchase EVs, the Biden administration has pressed emissions standards that could force automakers to ensure that up to two-thirds of their new vehicles sold are zero-emissions by 2032. According to a report in the Detroit Free Press, Slotkin voted against legislation that would have blocked the new standards, but has expressed openness to rewriting them if they would hurt U.S. automakers.
""I want that manufacturing here. I don't care what you drive, I want to build them,"" Slotkin said during Monday’s debate.
The two candidates also attempted to cast blame on the other for the situation at thesouthern border, with Slotkin accusing Rogers and Republicans of a campaign to kill Biden’s border legislation before it could get through Congress.
""What's going on at the southern border is a symptom of a broken immigration system,"" Slotkin said, accusing Republicans of using the ""border as a political issue than actually do the real work and get things done.""

Rogers instead blamed Democrats on the issue, calling Biden’s legislation a ""terrible bill"" that would have allowed for continued legal crossings, while Slotkin questioned how Rogers could claim to know better on the issue than the national Border Patrol union, which threw its support behind the deal.
The debate also highlighted the two candidates' competing viewson abortion, with Slotkin doubling down on campaign ads that have accused Rogers of supporting several pieces of anti-abortion legislation.
""He has shown us who he is, don’t trust him on this issue,"" Slotkin said.

Rogers countered by arguing that he supported leaving the question of abortion to the voters in each state, promising not to do anything in the Senate that would undo the will of voters in Michigan who voted to make abortion a right in the state.
""I won't do anything when I go back to the United States Senate to undo the vote of the people,"" Rogers said.
Another tense exchange saw the two candidates trade blows over gun reform, with Slotkin acknowledging her ownhistory with firearmsbut calling for tougher legislation to ""go after the number one killer of children in our communities.""

""It's really, really easy to understand why politicians, in the face of murdered children, don't do anything. They don't do it because they receive campaign donations and they're scared,"" Slotkin said. ""They're scared because they don't want to lose their election, and it's terrible.""
THE BIDEN-HARRIS EV MANDATES WILL HURT WORKERS IN STATES LIKE MICHIGAN: TUDOR DIXON
Rogers countered that the issue mostly centered on the country’s struggles with mental health, and that ""banning guns isn’t going"" to solve the issue.
Inflation andthe economywere another major issue during the debate, with Rogers appealing to voters to remember if they were better off under the leadership of Republicans four years ago.
""Are you better off than you were four years ago?"" Rogers asked. ""My opponent voted 100% with Biden-Harris (Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic presidential nominee) on all of the things that have raised your prices.""
Slotkin responded by pointing to her support for bringing supply chains back to the U.S., which she argued would help bring prices down. She also hit Rogers on his lack of support for allowing the government to negotiate lower pharmaceutical prices, something she said would help alleviate the pressure on middle-class families.

The Senate race in Michigan will be one of the closely watched nationally and features one of the few tight races that could determine control of the upper chamber this election.
According to theFox News Power Rankings, the Michigan Senate race leans in the Democrats' favor. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average, Slotkin currently holds a slim 1.9 lead over her Republican opponent.
Even so, the race has shifted significantly since Sept. 19, when Slotkin held a 5.1 advantage over Rogers in the average.
Republicans have showed optimism about the race, with Axios reporting Tuesday that the Republicans' Senate Leadership Fund will pour another $10.5 million into Rogers' campaign for the home stretch of the election.

The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), the House GOP’s campaign arm, released a new digital ad on Tuesday marking 21 days until the election.
It comes as Republican Party operators at the state, federal and local level work overtime to convince supporters to vote early, particularly in pivotal swing states like Georgia and North Carolina that have been ravaged by Helene this storm season.

More than 230 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals are calling on former President Trump to release his medical records afterVice President Kamala Harrisdid so.
In anopen letterdated Oct. 13, first reported by CBS News, the health care providers raise concerns about Trump's advanced age and argue that the 78-year-old Republican nominee should be transparent about his health and medical history.
""On August 20, Donald Trump said he would ‘very gladly’ release his medical records. In the 55 days since, he has yet to do so,"" the letter states. ""With no recent disclosure of health information from Donald Trump, we are left to extrapolate from public appearances. And on that front, Trump is falling concerningly short of any standard of fitness for office and displaying alarming characteristics of declining acuity.""
Most of the signatories support Harris for president. The letter asserts that Trump appears to ""ramble, meander, and crudely lash out at his many perceived grievances"" during his campaign events and questions whether this behavior is the result of cognitive changes associated with old age.

""The American people deserve to have confidence in their elected officials' mental and physical capacity to do the jobs that they've elected them to do. Trump ought to be going above and beyond to provide transparency on his physical health and mental acuity, given his advancing age.""
The letter comes while Harris is goading Trump into releasing his health information after the White House put out a ""Healthcare Statement"" on Saturday that declared her to be in ""excellent health.""

Thestatement from Harris' doctoralso indicated she had her most recent annual physical exam in April of this year. Trump released his own health records while campaigning in 2016, and once he took over the White House he continued the trend. In August, with the 2024 election quickly approaching, Trump told CBS News that he would release updated medical records to the public. However, he has yet to do so, with roughly three weeks until Election Day.
""He won't put out his medical records,"" Harris said Monday morning during an interview with podcast host Roland Martin. She also slammed Trump for refusing to debate a second time and questioned why Trump's ""staff"" would not allow him to do an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" particularly when it is tradition for both presidential candidates to do a sit down with the show.

""It may be because they think he's just not ready and unfit and unstable and should not have that level of transparency for the American people,"" Harris suggested.
The Trump campaign responded by pointing out several times the former president has voluntarily released updates about his health. They also noted that he sharedrecords from a July screeningconducted by Dr. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician turned GOP congressman, following the second assassination attempt on his life.
""All have concluded [Trump] is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,"" said Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung. ""He has maintained an extremely busy and active campaign schedule unlike any other in political history."" Meanwhile, Cheung slammed Harris as being ""unable to keep up with demands of campaigning,"" arguing that compared to Trump her schedule ""is much lighter because, it is said, she does not have the stamina of President Trump.""

foxnews,From cease-fire push to boots on the ground in Israel: US seemingly accepts involvement in escalating war,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/what-does-putting-us-troops-ground-mean-us-involvement-israeli-response-iran,"Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on the U.S. deploying a missile defense system to Israel on ‘Your World.’
The U.S. is now more deeply entrenched in the conflict in the Middle East after a pivotal move to send troopsto Israelwas announced this week.
On Monday, the Biden administration revealed it would offer Israel one of theU.S.’s highly sophisticated THAAD missile defense systems– as Israel braces for potential Iranian retaliation to the counter-attack it is planning after Tehran rained down missiles on Tel Aviv on Oct. 1.
Only U.S. troops can operate the system, and 100 of them will deploy to Israel. The Pentagon only has seven operable Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries in its possession, and the one offered to Israel would presumably be among the seven.
Though Washington has armed Israel throughout its existence, putting boots on the ground for Israel's defense is a rare departure from U.S. policy and the first U.S. deployment there since the outbreak of war after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.
""It's a bit unprecedented,"" said EJ Kimpton, policy director at the U.S. Israel Education Association.
""Israel's mantra has been, you know, with ‘Never Again,’ meaning we will defend ourselves by ourselves, obviously working with allies, but that we should be able to defend our country and not be dependent upon others,"" Kimpton went on. ""It changes the dynamic between the U.S. and Israel in Israel's war fighting over the years.""

""This would be the first time that U.S. personnel would be actively engaged in essentially fighting a war with Israelif Iranwere to carry out additional strikes.""
NETANYAHU HITS BIDEN ADMIN, SAYS ISRAEL – NOT US – WILL DECIDE HOW TO HANDLE IRAN
From pushing Israel to a cease-fire, the U.S. has pivoted to containing the war in the Middle East, to seemingly accepting the fate of U.S. involvement in the conflict.
The U.S. has some 43,000 troops deployed elsewhere in the Middle East and recently sent a ""few thousand"" to the region within the last few weeks to be ready to defend Israel if necessary.
""It's inescapable to see it as anything else [than escalation], the United States is now actually sending troops. We did not do that in Ukraine,"" Trita Parsi, vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, told Fox News Digital.
Sending U.S. troopsto Ukraineis a non-starter in American discourse – a popular refrain among supporters is that such aid will prevent U.S. troops from ever having to put themselves in Russia's line of fire.
""We may end up having American casualties, and to put soldiers in that type of vulnerable situation for something that is not the defense of the United States itself, I think, is a very serious step taken by the administration,"" said Parsi.
In the past, Iranians have targeted military installations, including Israeli air defense systems. The THAAD system is expected to be able to intercept ballistic missiles launched from Iran and Yemen and shoot down any short-range missiles launched by Hezbollah from Lebanon.
Others question why the administration is supplying the system with no real off-ramp to the conflict or U.S. involvement in it. Israel’s mission to eradicate Hezbollah and Hamas has now drawn it into direct conflict with Iran, and hope for peace anytime soon appears to have faded.
""Why are we keeping U.S. troops in harm’s way in Iraq and Syria with no clear mission or defensive strategy, while deploying critical defense systems like THAAD to Israel?"" Jason Beardsley, senior coalitions adviser to Concerned Veterans for America, questioned.

""The reality is, we’re funding both sides of this conflict – directly aiding Iraq, whose Iranian-backed militias target our forces, and indirectly supporting Israel’s defense without addressing the real vulnerability: U.S. personnel scattered across the Middle East, with Iran’s proxies actively targeting our troops.""
IDF MEETS LITTLE RESISTANCE FROM HEZBOLLAH AFTER WEEKS OF HITTING TERROR TARGETS, OFFICIALS SAY
The U.S. has some 2,500 troops in Iraq leading a coalition that provides extensive support to the Iraqi Security Forces to fight ISIS. But Iran has already tightened its grip on Baghdad and the mission its forces carry out.
The THAAD will assist Israel’s other missile defenses in what could be the Biden administration bracing for escalation: an aggressive counter-attack from Iran to an aggressive counter-attack from Israel.
For two weeks, the world has waited to see how Israel responds to the 200 missiles Iran fired at the heart of Tel Aviv.
A violent showing from Israel might deter Iran from wanting to pick a larger battle. But in the Biden administration’s view, a disproportionate response risks a tit-for-tat that could lead to all-out war.
President Biden may have offered the system as a way to coax Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to follow his recommendation: to make sure Israel's counterstrike to Iran’s missile attacks is ""proportional"" – by going after military installations – not nuclear or oil facilities.

""I think the administration may be thinking that by offering this, they can convince the Israelis not to go that far,"" said Parsi.
""If you truly want to put an end to this, then sending the same system that actually makes it easier for Israel to escalate is not the answer…  Sometimes, it's really difficult to discern who is actually making the policy and what is the policy.""
Netanyahu told Biden he was willing to strike military facilities when they spoke on the phone last week, according to aWashington Post report.But after that report, Netanyahu said in a statement he would not be making any decisions based on Biden's insistence on proportionality.

""I’m not sure which is worse to consider, that threatening an ally is a necessary pre-election political theater to pacify radical pro-Hamas leftists or that it’s actually U.S. policy to cut off arms to Israel if Israel doesn’t agree to feed, fuel and fund Hamas,"" Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and former NSC official in the Trump administration, told Fox News Digital.
""Because let’s be clear, that’s what this is really all about – whether Hamas survives by controlling humanitarian aid and its distribution,"" Goldberg said.
The letter, which wasfirst obtained by Axios, expressed its ""deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza"" and is particularly concerned that recent actions by the Israeli government, including halting commercial imports and denying or impeding nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September, are ""contributing to an accelerated deterioration in the conditions in Gaza.""

The letter says Israel has within 30 days to ""reverse the downward humanitarian trajectory"" and remain consistent with its obligations to the U.S. Failure to comply with these demands, the letter said, would violate existing U.S. law and have serious implications for U.S. national security policy.
Israel has defended its humanitarian response to the crisis in Gaza in a statement released on Monday by COGAT, the army division that deals with aid to Gaza, stating, ""Since the start of the war, Israel has allowed the international community to bring 54,270 aid trucks into Gaza, carrying 1,064,820 tons of humanitarian aid through various crossings, including 38,746 trucks carrying approximately 824,078 tons of food.""

The U.S. must continually assess the delivery of humanitarian aid under the Foreign Assistance Act in order to provide foreign military financing assistance to Israel. President Biden issued a memorandum in February stating countries receivingU.S. weaponsmust adhere to international humanitarian law and provide written assurances of their compliance under the laws of war.
The U.S. has surged billions of dollars in security aid to Israel since the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel is also the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid since its founding and has received around $310 billion in economic and military aid. On average, the U.S. provides Israel with over $3 billion in security assistance a year.

A major component of security aid includes $500 million a year for joint U.S.-Israeli missile defense programs, notably the Iron Dome, David’s Sling and Arrow II, which have been critical to thwarting rocket and missile attacks from Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran since Oct. 7.
Some of the military aid to Israel since Oct. 7 includes 13,981 120mm M830A1 high-explosive anti-tank multi-purpose with tracer (MPAT) tank cartridges, 500 aircraft deliveries and 107 sea shipments to Israel of over 50,000 tons of munitions and weapons systems, according to the Congressional Research Service.

""A reminder to the French President: It was not a UN decision that established the State of Israel but the victory that was achieved in theWar of Independencewith the blood of our heroic fighters, many of whom were Holocaust survivors, including from the Vichy regime in France,"" Netanyahu read from a statement in response to Macron's comment.
Macron's remarks came as he called for an end to arms exports to the Gaza Strip and Lebanon in an effort to create conditions for a cease-fire.
The call for an arms embargo comes amid Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza following the terror group's unprovoked attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and its military operations in Lebanon, following a year of rocket fire from Hezbollah, which is backedby Iran.
Earlier this month, Netanyahu criticized Macron and other Western leaders for calls to stop the flow of arms.

""As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilized countries should be standing firmly by Israel’s side, yet President Macron and other western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them,""Netanyahu saidin a statement.
He continued, ""Is Iran imposing an arms embargoon Hezbollah, on the Houthis, on Hamas and on its other proxies? Of course not. This axis of terror stands together, but countries who supposedly oppose this terror axis call for an arms embargo on Israel.""
He called their stance a ""disgrace,"" saying that Israel would win ""with or without their support, but their shame will continue long after the war is won.""
On Oct. 6, Macron said France would no longer supply arms to Israel, although it would continue to send missile defense equipment.

Mike Waltz, R-Fla., debated loaded terms like ‘fascist’ and ‘socialist’ that have been used to describe the two presidential candidates.
CNN anchor John Berman andRep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., got into a tense exchange Tuesday morning over politically charged terms like ""fascist"" and ""socialist"" that have been used to describe the two presidential candidates.
At a recent rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, Vice President Kamala Harris played a mashup of clips in which Trump warned ofdangers from ""the enemy within.""
""The worst people are the enemies from within... those people are more dangerous; the enemy within; than Russia and China. These people should be put in jail the way they talk about our judges and our justices,"" Trump collectively stated in some of the television clips played.
In recent comments on the matter toFox Business'Maria Bartiromo, Trump spoke about such ""enemies,"" and quipped that while China and Russia are ""dangerous"" at times to deal with, ""the thing that's tougher to handle are these lunatics that we have inside like Adam Schiff.""

Schiff, a congressman from Burbank, Calif., is currently the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate against Republican retired MLB star Steve Garvey.
During an interview on ""CNN News Central,"" Berman asked Waltz whether it was ""responsible"" for Trump to make such comments.
Waltz claimed that Trump was talking about issues that are ""detrimental"" to democracy in the United States and undermine public trust in institutions. For example, he claimed that Schiff, a senior House Intelligence Committee member, leaked information from compartmented hearings and lied to the public in open hearings.
Berman then referenced the ""lunatic"" comment directed at Schiff and suggested that Trump was also talking about dealing with ""lunatics"" in a hypothetical military deployment.
""John, people were on this network calling Trump Hitler and the next coming of another dictator and two people have tried to kill him. We have the Iranians trying to kill him. A foreign adversary trying to assassinate him and we're talking about him playing music in a rally,"" Waltz said.
Berman acknowledged that while it is essential to talk about heated rhetoric directed at Trump, Waltz himself has suggested that Harris is a ""socialist.""

""So, these phrases do get tossed around,"" Berman added.
Waltz said that socialism is a ""longstanding political ideology"" and very different from claiming that Trump would be ""the world's most god-awful dictator"" and Hitler. Waltz also contended that such language is radicalizing people to take action.
He also noted that some members of Congress have referred to themselves as ""democratic socialists"" and insisted that Berman was not making a ""fair comparison.""
""You don't?"" Berman asked. ""You talk about Marxism. You talk about socialism. And do you think Kamala Harris is a Marxist or a socialist?""

Waltz said that he believes Marxism is ""underpinning"" some of Harris' policies, such as price controls.
Berman then tried to draw a comparison between Waltz's comments about Harris andretired Gen. Mark Milley'sremarks about Trump.
Milley reportedly said, ""No one has ever been as dangerous to this country as Donald Trump… Now I realize he's a total fascist. He is the most dangerous person to this country,"" according to a new book by journalist Bob Woodward.
""He's saying that Donald Trump espouses fascist policies,"" Berman said. ""It's a political ideology. Fascism is a political ideology.""

AFGHAN CHARGED WITH ELECTION DAY TERROR PLOT RAISES QUESTIONS, FEARS FROM LAWMAKERS: ‘THIS IS REAL’
SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN:I was briefed a few weeks prior to this, not by the FBI, but from a different agency. What we understood is this individual was vulnerable to touch points, meaning that they were accepted in on an SIV, special immigration visa, but there's confusion if he was prior or after the withdrawal. We believe that he was rushed with an SIV after the disastrouswithdrawal from Afghanistan,and it wasn't proper vetting to actually say he was an SIV. The issue that we have here is there's thousands of individuals that [were] rushed over here because of the Harris-Biden withdrawal, and they weren't properly vetted. And when you don't probably vet them, you don't know what their touch points – touch points mean their vulnerabilities –  vulnerabilities mean what can be leveraged against the individual to make them turn on their host country like this individual did. Fortunately, the FBI was doing their job. They did it correctly that no one was actually at harm, but they caught the individual.How many individuals are out therethat we're not paying attention to?

Authorities announced last week the arrest ofNasir Ahmad Tawhedi, an Afghan nationalwho came to the U.S. in 2021 after the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Tawhedi is charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS and receiving a firearm to be used to commit a felony or a federal crime of terrorism.
Authorities say he liquidated his family's assets to finance his plan, including purchasing rifles and one-way tickets for his wife and child back to Afghanistan.
""This defendant, motivated by ISIS, allegedly conspired to commit a violent attack, on Election Day, here on our homeland,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray in a statement.

Court filings initially stated that he came on a special immigrant visa but have since clarified that he came to the U.S. via humanitarian parole and later applied for SIV status.
A senior administration officialtold Fox News last week that Tawhedi was screened three times. He was screened first to work security for the CIA in Afghanistan, then for humanitarian parole to enter the U.S. in 2021, when he was vetted and screened in a third country, and then for special immigrant status, for which he was approved. His status has not yet been finalized. Officials believe he was radicalized after coming to the U.S.

Bidenadministrationofficials have urged Israel to show restraint against both Iran and Hezbollah, the terrorist proxy group operating in Lebanon. Netanyahu's regime has mulled action against Iran since it fired roughly 200 missiles into Israeli territory on Oct. 1.
""We listen to the opinions of the United States, but we will make our final decisions based on our national interest,""Netanyahu saidin a statement.
Netanyahu issued the statement following a report from the Washington Post claiming that the Biden White House was confident that Netanyahu was in a ""more moderate place"" now than in recent weeks.

White House officials say Israel has assured the U.S. that it will not target Iran's oil or nuclear facilities, however. That agreement came after Biden and Netanyahu held a phone call last week and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with Israeli officials this week, according to the Wall Street Journal.
White House national security adviserJakeSullivanreportedly told Israeli officials earlier this month that the U.S. expects ""clarity and transparency"" about Israel's plans, specifically regarding any retaliation against Iran for the latest missile attack.

A Detroit pastor accused Vice President Kamala Harris of ""exploiting"" the Black vote as she prepares for an event with podcaster Charlamagne tha God in a bid to shore up support with Black males.
Pastor Lorenzo Sewell, who leads 180 Church in Detroit, detailed why he is ""offended"" by Harris' decisionduring ""Fox & Friends.""
HERSCHEL WALKER SAYS OBAMA ‘FORGOT OUR FIGHT FOR RIGHT TO VOTE’ AFTER SCOLDING BLACK VOTERS AGAINST HARRIS
""I have never been so offended in my life,"" Sewell told Lawrence Jones on Tuesday. ""She's bringing a man here who is Charlamagne, a false god, to a community that has 4,500 churches, all people of faith. We are extremely offended that she's bringing a podcaster here to talk to Black men about politics. She brought a retired athlete to Flint who is failing –  Magic Johnson – and she brought Oprah to Oakland County, as if she understands the plight and the playing of people that look like me.""
""We will not allow virtue signaling. We will not allow identity politics. Black men are not political infants,"" he continued. ""We know exactly what's happening with the Democratic Party. We know that they've exploited us for over six decades, and we are saying, just like Moses said to Pharaoh, ‘Let my people go.’""

Harris dismissed pollingthis week that indicates she has lost support with Black men during a 23-minute sit-down with Black-focused entertainment outlet ""The Shade Room.""
She was asked about polls indicating that the Democrats' advantage with Black voters has declined from past presidential cycles, and among Black men in particular.
""When you hear those numbers, and you're seeing in the polls — Black men aren't as excited or fired up for you, how do you respond to that?"" host Justin Carter asked Harris.
The VP immediately dismissed the polls and suggested that things could change in the next three weeks before the November election. ""One, that's not my experience,"" Harris responded. ""Two, Election Day has not arrived yet.""
CNN DATA REPORTER PREDICTS TRUMP WILL WIN ‘HISTORIC’ NUMBER OF BLACK AND HISPANIC VOTERS
Harris went on to say that she is not taking these voters for granted and is working to earn their support.
""Black men are no different from anybody else. They expect that you have to earn their vote. And that's why I'm out here,"" she continued.
""It's incumbent on me to earn their support, that’s why I’m talking to folks about the work I’ve done in my career,"" she said, citing her efforts to help strengthen small businesses and pledging to continue to do so if elected as president.
According to aNew York Times/Siena College pollreleased on Saturday, Harris currently holds 78% of the Black vote, which is down from 2020, when President Biden won approximately 90% of that voting bloc. It's also down from 2016, when Hillary Clinton won approximately 92% of the Black vote. Harris' support among Black men has dropped even more significantly, according to the report: 70% said they would vote for Harris in November, down from Biden’s 85% in 2020.
""She continues to think that she can entertain her way to the Black vote,"" Sewell said. ""We're offended, and we want her to be willing to actually bring real solutions to the complex problems that we're facing in urban America.""
Meanwhile, Harris rolled out her ""Opportunity Agenda for Black Men"" this week, which includes providing 1 million loans that are fully forgivable to Black entrepreneurs and others to start a business, championing education, training and mentorship programs that help Black men get good-paying jobs in high-demand industries and lead their communities, including pathways to become teachers.

Radio host Charlamagne Tha God spoke to Andrew Schulz on ""The Brilliant Idiots"" podcast, telling him that an anonymous source argued his interview with former President Trump was so good it already decided the election.((Photo by Marcus Ingram/Getty Images))
Schulz burst out laughing, ""The interview was fire, bro, I don’t know what to tell you.""
Charlamagne and Schulz went on to discuss how Trump’s off-the-cuff humor is a stark contrast with Vice President Kamala Harris, who Schulz argued is afraid of losing the advantage she believes she has.
""There’s nothing about the poll numbers that we’re seeing right now that should make anybody feel like she’s got this,"" Charlamagne said, and when acomparison was made to Hillary in 2016he replied, ""I keep telling people this campaign feels more Hillary-ish than it does Obama-ish- than Obama ’08-ish.""
During the interview on ""Flagrant,"" Trump had the hosts in stitches numerous times with his irreverent humor, such as when he joked that Biden has one advantage over him.
""He has one ability that I don't have — he sleeps,"" Trump said. ""He can sleep! This guy goes on a beach, and he lays down on one of those 6-ounce [chairs]. They weigh 6 ounces, and he can’t lift it. They're meant for children, young people, and old people to lift. They’re aluminum, you know, hollow aluminum, they weigh very little, and he can't lift.""
He later went on to joke, ""Somebody convinced him helooks good in a bathing suit,and when you’re 82, typically bathing suits aren’t gonna make you look great.""
IN ARIZONA SPEECH, VANCE SAYS NEXT PRESIDENT MUST PUT AMERICANS FIRST, SLAMS FEMA MONEY FOR MIGRANTS

On The Breakfast Club, Charlamagne recently critiqued the Harris-Walz campaign’s messaging tactics, arguing that their commentary about global politics seems ""very out of touch to what’s going on right here in America.""
This, he said, is a stark difference from Trump and his running-mate JD Vance, who are ""talking about what’s happening here at home and saying things like‘America First’and ‘Make America Great Again,’ that messaging sometimes resonates a lot more.""
He then corrected himself and said, ""Not sometimes, it does resonate a lot more.""

foxnews,"Voter beware: Text scam targets you, no matter where you live",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/voter-beware-text-scam-targets-you-no-matter-where-you-live,"Kurt Knutsson gives Android users some tips to stem the tide of annoying text messages from political campaigns.
As Election Day approaches, scammers are finding new ways to deceive voters. Several media reports are highlighting a new scam where people receive a text message falsely claiming they are not yet registered to vote. Election officials are warning Americans to be cautious of these scam messages, as more are expected to circulate in the weeks leading up to the general election.

The local Channel 4 affiliate WDIV in Detroit warned about a new text message wave in late August that could prevent registered voters from casting their ballot. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported a similar incident around the same time, warning Pennsylvanians to be wary of potential scam text messages targeting voters.
A spokesperson for the Department of State said voters should expect more of these messages to be sent in the weeks leading up to the general election.
""Voters should be aware that opportunistic bad actors may attempt to use this campaign season to send phishing or smishing emails/texts,"" Matt Heckel, a spokesperson for the department, told the Philadelphia Inquirer.
Both these reports and several others refer to a text message that is linked to the site all-vote.com: ""We have you in our records as not registered to vote. Check your registration status and register in 2 minutes.""

DON’T FALL PREY TO THIS ELECTION SEASON’S CRAFTIEST SCAMS
For one, the domain all-vote.com isn’t associated with the government. Another clue is that even people who were already registered to vote in their state received this message. WDIV even interviewed a seventh-grader from Canada who said he also got the text, despite not being eligible to vote.
A quick search on Who.Is lookup shows the domain was registered on July 10, 2024, definitely a red flag.KrebsOnSecuritymentioned that some of these texts are also linking to another domain, votewin.org, which asks for your name, address, email, date of birth and phone number when you visit.
They even pre-check boxes to sign you up for more notifications. The government doesn’t need all that info from you. To register to vote or to update your voter registration, all you need to do is visitvote.govand select your state or region.

FAKE SOFTWARE FIXES FUEL MONEY-STEALING MALWARE THREAT
1) Unsolicited contact: If you receive a message from an unknown number or an unexpected source, especially one claiming urgency (like registering to vote), it could be a scam.
2) Suspicious links: Scammers often use fake links that appear legitimate but redirect you to phishing websites. Always hover over links or check the domain carefully. In the case of ""all-vote.com,"" if it's not a well-known or official site (like .gov for U.S. voting), it's worth being suspicious.
3) Grammatical errors: Many scam messages contain typos, awkward phrasing or grammatical mistakes. This can be a red flag for phishing or scam attempts.
4) Requests for personal information: Legitimate organizations typically don’t ask for sensitive information like Social Security numbers, bank details or passwords via text. Scams often do.
5) Have strong antivirus software:The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious texts, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.
HOW TO STOP ANNOYING ROBOCALLS
As Election Day gets closer, it’s essential to stay alert to scams like these. If you receive a suspicious text about your voter registration, remember to check the details carefully. Look out for unofficial domains like all-vote.com or votewin.org, which have nothing to do with the government. Always head to trusted sites like vote.gov to confirm your status. Scammers are getting creative, but knowing the signs can help you avoid getting caught up in their traps.

foxnews,"Harris' off-putting manner put Zelenskyy on defensive ahead of Russian invasion, new book reveals",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-off-putting-manner-put-zelenskyy-defensive-ahead-russian-invasion-new-book-reveals,"Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker discusses growing threats from Russia and China on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.’
Vice President Kamala Harris’history as a federal prosecutor instilled in her a direct, sometimes adversarial communication style that reportedly alienated Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during their first private sit-down, leaving him ""disgruntled"" and defensive just days before Russian troops invaded his country.
Their tense sit-down was chronicled in ""War,"" the new book by Bob Woodward. In the book, Woodward details some of the most consequential foreign policy and security challengesoverseen by President Biden during his first term. Among them, Russia’s 2022 invasion and ongoing war in Ukraine.
Fox News obtained an early copy of the book, which is available in bookstores today.
As Woodward reports, Biden deployed Harris to the Munich Security Conference in February 2022, less than a week before Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops commenced their full-scale invasion of Ukraine – with the sole mission of convincing Zelenskyy that theRussian incursionwas imminent, based on all available U.S. intelligence and the hundreds of thousands of troops it had confirmed Russia had been amassing nearby, including some 40,000 soldiers near the Belarusian border.
Harris was to demonstrate unified support for Ukraine from the U.S. and NATO, and to help Zelenskyy accept the fact that this was, indeed, happening.
However, Woodward reports, aspects of that mission backfired – at least behind closed doors.
Publicly, Harris delivered a winning speech, effectively reassuring the world of the U.S. commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and Article 5. It is considered among her major achievements as vice president.
HUNTER BIDEN LEGAL SAGA IS ‘REAL WAR’ THAT 'PREOCCUPIED' OUTGOING PRESIDENT, NEW WOODWARD BOOK CLAIMS

In private, however, Zelenskyy was immediately put off by Harris’s brusque communication style and ""forceful"" demeanor during their sit-down, during which Harris and her national security adviser, Philip Gordon, wore masks and did not attempt to shake hands with their Ukrainian counterparts upon entering the room.
Though Germany was still under COVID-19 protocols, the icy start to the meeting ""disgruntled"" Zelenskyy, Woodward said, and left the Ukrainian president feeling ""like he was about to be reprimanded"" at a frightening and vulnerable time for his nation.
""You need to take seriously the likelihood that any day the Russians will invade your country,"" Harris told him forcefully.
In Woodward's telling, things between the two did not improve from there.
Harris, a successful former federal prosecutor and California attorney general, has been praised and criticized for her adversarial communication style – and it was one she reportedly employed during her sit-down with Zelenskyy, in attempt to convince him of the imminence of Russia's invasion.
TRUMP MEETS UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY AT TRUMP TOWER, SAYS RUSSIA'S WAR MUST END WITH 'FAIR DEAL'
Vice President Kamala Harris speaks to reporters at her hotel after the Munich Security Conference.(Andrew Harnik/Pool via Reuters)
""Look,"" Harris told him, after some tense back-and-forth, ""our teams will share more specific information with you but we are telling you that your numbers are wrong. You really face a potentially imminent invasion.""
Rather than softening him, the meeting appeared to put Ukraine's president even more on the defensive.
As Woodward writes, Zelenskyy was hard-pressed to acknowledge the imminence of the invasion despite credible U.S. intelligence, in large part because it would create a ""self-fulling prophecy"" for Ukraine's nascent democracy, risking the collapse of the country's economy, and potentially, its government.
Finally, Zelenskyy relented, looking Harris in the eye and asking directly, ""What do you want me to do?""
He inquired whether the U.S. would impose sanctions, close ports to Russian ships, give Ukraine Stinger or Javelin missiles or send warplanes to his country, in order to equip them for the battles ahead.
Harris’s answer did little to assuage him. ""The punishment can only come after the crime,"" she said of a U.S. response to Russia, Woodward noted, instead advising him to ""start thinking about things like having a succession plan in place to run the country if you're captured or killed or cannot govern.""
Zelenskyy was urged by the U.S. to have an escape plan – one which he boldly rebuffed, choosing to remain in Kyiv in the days and weeks following Russia’s invasion.
He also turned down evacuation offers from both the U.S. and Turkey following the start of the war.
The ""fight is here,"" he would later say from Kyiv. ""I need ammunition, not a ride.""

foxnews,"As a cautious Kamala loses momentum, Democrats are panicking over a Trump win",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cautious-kamala-loses-momentum-democrats-panicking-over-trump-win,"Fox News media analyst challenges ex-Clinton adviser Mark Penn's call for a full internal investigation into the ABC News Presidential Debate.
TheKamala Harriscampaign rocket, which soared to dazzling heights when she got into the race, is losing altitude.
Despite raising a billion dollars, despite overwhelmingly positive coverage by the mainstream media, she has failed to deliver a compelling message and is especially struggling to win over Black and Latino voters. There’s no question that many Democrats, who grew accustomed to reading stories about who’ll be in the Harris Cabinet, are panicking.
Now you could look at the glass as half-full and say it’s remarkable that a relatively unpopular vice president, in a short period of time, is running neck and neck withDonald Trump.She is tied nationally in a new NBC College poll. But that’s a drop of five points for Harris since the last survey in September.
Trump is the ultimate Teflon candidate. The press may jump on him for refusing to release his medical records (as Harris just did) but demanding she take a cognitive test; for using incendiary language against illegal immigrants, or for vowing to protect women when it’s his Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe.
NOW THAT KAMALA HARRIS IS DOING INTERVIEWS, PEOPLE ARE REMINDED THEY ‘DON’T LIKE HER’: LISA BOOTHE
The Harris campaign's hype train appears to be screeching to a grinding halt – and regardless of whether they'll admit it, Democratic intelligentsia are taking notice.(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)
It doesn’t matter. MAGA loyalists can’t stand the media, and they’re not going to change their minds at this late date. He has the advantage of having held the job. They remember Trump’s presidency with growing fondness, particularly for a strong economy and greater limits at the border, and brush aside any negative developments, especially Jan. 6.
Harris has certainly made policy proposals and done a bunch of softball interviews. But she made a big mistake on ""The View,"" saying she couldn’t think of a single thing where she’d differ fromJoe Biden.It was not intended as a gotcha question.
How can she grab the mantle of the change candidate and, with that sentence, cast herself as Biden 2.0?
KAMALA 2.0’S CHALLENGE? MAKING MORE NEWS, AND NOT JUST WITH ULTRA-FRIENDLY HOSTS
If she feels loyalty to Joe, it’s misguided. As a veteran pol, he would understand if she said he did a good job but here’s several areas where I disagree with him and would do things differently–no word salad allowed.
Axios and others are reporting tension between the Harris and Biden camps – she’s replaced the president’s top strategists and spokesmen – precisely the kind of leaks that mark a sputtering campaign.
When people complain that they don’t really know Kamala, they’re really saying they’re not yet prepared to trust her with the nuclear codes. She still has to pass the commander-in-chief test. But she also has to seem warm and approachable. That’s a daunting challenge in a country that, unlike much of the world, has never elected a female president.

""Her team either fears or knows she may not be up to it. And this is bleeding obvious. A presidential campaign where you rarely face the press, never deal with a hostile interview, and never hold a presser is a campaign defined by fear. You can smell it from miles away.""
Andrew, by the way, is voting for Harris, mainly because he’ll do anything to keep Trump out of theWhite House.
Kamala keeps talking about being the underdog, but she’s run a very cautious campaign. The anxiety about making a mistake should be outweighed by the need to make news, at a time when Trump is back to dominating the news. Many days go by in which she’s a minor TV presence compared to the ratings-boosting Trump.
It’s smart that she’s now agreed to several network town halls, but she should have been doing these from the start, rather than reciting the same stump speech at rallies. Drinking beer with Stephen Colbert doesn’t quite cut it.

And who would have thought that the woman of color would be lagging behind the usual Democratic margins among Blacks – particularly Black men –and Latinos?
Things reached the point where Barack Obama had to scold Black men for sexism, accusing them of not being comfortable with voting for a woman.
The battleground polls are tight, so obviously Harris can still win. But she basically needs to camp outin Pennsylvania,Michigan and Wisconsin rather than trying to pick off these Sunbelt states.

In fact, if she had put aside any personal friction and picked Josh Shapiro, she’d probably have more of an edge in his state. Instead, she went withTim Walz,who’s not helping the ticket much no matter how many pheasants he hunts. He has, however, done well in two straight interviews with ""Fox News Sunday.""
A major step forward: Harris agreeing yesterday to an interview with Fox anchor Bret Baier, on Wednesday in Pennsylvania. Some headlines are calling this a risky move, but Bret has vast experience with such interviews and will absolutely be fair. The upside for her: reaching the largest audience by far in cable news.
Bret said on the air that he believes there’s ""a sense that they have inside the campaign, their strategy has to change, they’ve got to change. They’re losing Black males… I think that the campaign realizes they have to do more outreach.""

foxnews,"Trump counters Harris media blitz by ripping Bob Woodward, Howard Stern and her hurricane briefing",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-counters-harris-media-blitz-ripping-bob-woodward-howard-stern-hurricane-briefing,"Panelists Kellyanne Conway, Howard Kurtz and Patrick Murphy react to Vice President Kamala Harris’ recent media interviews on ‘The Story.’
On one point, at least, the Kremlin has sided with Bob Woodwardagainst former President Donald Trump.
Woodward is coming out with a new book, and among its headline-making disclosures is his report on what happened when the pandemic struck, when the death toll was soaring and people could not get home testing kits for COVID-19.
FROM KISSY-FACE SITDOWN ON ‘THE VIEW’ TO A TOUGHER GRILLING ON ‘60 MINUTES,’ KAMALA HARRIS IS MAKING NEWS
Trump, at that point in 2020, secretly sentVladimir Putina number of Abbott Point of Care COVID test machines ""for his personal use.""
The Trump campaign said Woodward’s book, an advance copy of which was obtained by CNN, consisted entirely of made-up stories.
However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov confirmed the receipt of theCOVID machines.

""As for the tests, when the pandemic began, countries did not have enough equipment,"" Peskov said. ""And many countries then exchanged such gestures of support and sent each other shipments of various equipment they had.""
In fact, during the spring of 2020, Russia sent the Trump administration 60 tons of medical equipment.
Woodward also quotes the Russian dictator as telling Trump, ""I don’t want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me. They don’t care about me.""
KAMALA 2.0’S CHALLENGE? MAKING MORE NEWS, AND NOT JUST WITH ULTRA-FRIENDLY HOSTS
However, Peskov disputed another assertion by Woodward, that Trump has stayed in touch with Putin since he left the White House, with as many as seven calls between them. ""As for the calls, that's a lie,"" Peskov said.
In the book ""War,"" however, the Washington Post sleuth recounts a scene where Trump tells a top aide to leave the room so ""he could have what he said was a private phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin."" Trump officials now say they are not aware of any such conversations.
The former president granted Woodward 18 taped interviews for his previous book, but they had a falling out after the veteran reporter wrote that Trump was unfit for office and was sued by his subject for releasing the recordings.

I know Woodward’s work extremely well, and while any journalist can be misled by sources, he does not make things up.
Other parts of the book dealwith President Bidenconfronting Putin about the coming invasion of Ukraine, had Vice President Kamala Harris warn a skeptical Volodomyr Zelenskyy, and – with officials assuming a 50% chance that he might use a tactical nuclear weapon against the Ukrainians, called the Kremlin boss the ""epitome of evil.""
The president repeatedlycursed out Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin ""Bibi"" Netanyahu, calling him an ""SOB"" and, later, a ""f---ing liar"" after the Israeli prime minister invaded the crowded area called Rafah despite American pressure.
WHY VANCE EASILY BEAT WALZ IN DEBATE, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE IN THE PROCESS
In the statement from Trump’s spokesman, which sounds like it was dictated by the boss, Woodward is described as ""a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. Woodward is an angry, little man and is clearly upset because President Trump is successfully suing him because of the unauthorized publishing of recordings he made previously. President Trump gave him absolutely no access for this trash book that either belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section of a discount bookstore or used as toilet tissue. Woodward is a total sleazebag who has lost it mentally, and he’s slow, lethargic, incompetent and overall a boring person with no personality.""
Why stop there?
Trump, who prides himself on being a counter-puncher, wastes little time before swinging away.

After Harris’ friendly radio interview with Howard Stern, who said it would be insanity to vote for Trump, a post appeared on Truth Social.
""BETA MALE Howard Stern made a fool of himself on his low-rated radio show when he ‘interviewed’ Lyin’ Kamala Harris, and hit her with so many SOFTBALL questions that even she was embarrassed.
""He looked like a real fool, working so hard to make a totally incompetent and ill-equipped person look as good as possible, which wasn’t very good. I dropped Howard a long time ago, like most others, and have since been credited with very good judgment!""
Trump and Stern were, of course, once New York pals, and Trump attended his wedding.
Trump also had campaign manager Chris LaCivita take a swipe at Fox News for covering (along with other networks) a government briefing, featuring both Biden and Harris, on Hurricane Milton as the monster storm was heading toward Florida.
""@FoxNews ⁩just as bad as every other ‘cable news’ network …running literally propaganda and @KamalaHarris ⁩TV ads disguised as a news conference,"" Chris LaCivita posted on X.

Of course, there’s a political benefit for Harris showing that she and FEMA are working hard to prepare for the Florida storm, just as there is when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis holds a presser on the Category 5 threat.
However, with Harris' media blitz finally making some news after weeks in which Trump has dominated the campaign coverage, this reflects his determination to insert himself into every story that surfaces, no matter how negative.

abcnews,Trump says US troops should be used to go after 'radical left.' Can he do that?,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/could-trump-use-military-go-after-radical-left/story?id=114806253,"The military isn't supposed to police Americans, but there are exceptions.
Former President Donald Trump saysactive-duty or National Guard troops could be usedto go after ""radical left lunatics"" to handle any Election Day chaos, warning that the bigger problem facing the United States isn't a foreign enemy but ""the people from within.""
The suggestion of using military force following a political election is hypothetical, considering Trump won't have command of U.S. troops in November. If he wins the election, Trump wouldn't gain control of the armed forces until mid-January following the inauguration.
But deploying the military within U.S. borders is a suggestion Trump has made before, including the idea that the military could police the southern border and help deport an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.
""I think the bigger problem are the people from within,"" Trump told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures.""
""We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics... And it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard or really necessary by the military, because they can't let that happen,"" he said.
So, can a president use U.S. troops to police Americans and quash political protests?
Many of Trump's supporters say yes, citing a 200-year-old law meant to curb rebellions. The Insurrection Act of 1807 was used during the Civil War and throughout the 1960s to enforce civil rights laws.
Legal experts are now warning the law is dangerously vague and ripe for abuse.
Here's what to know about the use of military power on U.S. soil:
The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act mostly prohibits active-duty military troops from carrying out law enforcement duties inside the United States.
The idea behind the law is that any president -- as commander in chief of U.S. forces -- shouldn't be allowed to use federal military might against its own citizens.
But it's a different law that was passed earlier that century that's caught the attention of many Trump supporters.
First enacted in 1807, theInsurrection Actsays the president can call on a militia or the U.S. armed forces if there's been ""any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination or conspiracy"" in a state that ""opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.""
According to theBrennan Center for Justice, the law has been invoked dozens of times throughout history, including by Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and by Lyndon B. Johnson to quell rioting after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
In 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower used the law to deploy members of the Army's 101st Airborne Division to escort nine Black students into Little Rock Central High School, after the Arkansas governor used the state's National Guard to prevent the students from entering the school.
More recently, the law was invoked by President George H.W. Bush during the1992 riots inLos Angelesthat followed the trial acquittal of police officers in the Rodney King case. The law was also under consideration in 2005 following Hurricane Katrina, but was not used.
In the days leading up to the Jan. 6 riot, some Trump supporters wanted the president to invoke the Insurrection Act as a justification for far-right militia groups to storm the Capitol and to keep Trump in power despite losing the election.
Trump falsely claimed he won the election, but never invoked the Insurrection Act while in office.
Legal experts have proposed reforms to the Insurrection Act, includingone proposalearlier this year by the American Law Institute.
""There is agreement on both sides of the aisle that the Insurrection Act gives any president too much unchecked power,""Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor and former assistant attorney general in the Bush administration, said last April.
It's unlikely, though, that such a sharply divided Congress would take up the issue any time soon.
There's another law, too, that Trump could try to rely on when it comes to handling illegal immigration -- the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which allows the president to deport any noncitizen from a country that the U.S. is at war with.
In his interview withTime magazinethis year, Trump didn't cite a legal justification when he said he'd use the National Guard to conduct mass deportations and create detention camps for people living illegally inside the U.S.
In the end, whether any of Trump's proposals are legal would likely be determined by the courts, including federal judges he appointed.

abcnews,Trump's 'enemy from within' threat spurs critics' alarm about his authoritarian shift,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-enemy-threat-spurs-critics-alarm-authoritarian-shift/story?id=114816374,"He suggested the military could be used against ""radical left lunatics.""
Donald Trump, in a recent interview, suggested his political opponents are more of a threat to the U.S. than top foreign adversaries such as China and Russia when it comes to the 2024 election.
""I think the bigger problem are the people from within,"" Trumptold Fox Newsanchor Maria Bartiromo. ""We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics.""
Then he floated the idea of deploying the military against them on American soil, arguing without proof they would be more likely to sow chaos on Nov. 5 than his supporters -- despite what transpired on Jan. 6, 2021.
""I think it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen,"" Trump added.
The dark comments highlight Trump's increasing bend toward authoritarian rhetoric in his third White House campaign, some political scientists told ABC News.
""It's really classic authoritarian discourse,"" said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University professor and author of ""How Democracies Die,"" citing examples from 1930s Europe and 1960s Latin America.
""In each of these cases, autocrats used exactly this language: there's an enemy within that's more dangerous than our external enemies and that justifies the use of extra-constitutional measures,"" he said. ""How many times does Trump have to use this rhetoric before we realize that this is not a normal election?""
Trump's ""enemy from within"" comments come after a history of praising authoritarian leaders in public as well asthreats to jail election workers, pledges to take on the civil service and toenact retributionon political enemies if elected -- all of which would significantly stretch the normal limits of executive power.
Vice President Kamala Harris, playing clips of his Fox News comments, painted Trump as ""increasingly unstable and unhinged"" and ""out for unchecked power"" at a Pennsylvania rally on Monday.
""He considers anyone who doesn't support him or who will not bend to his will an enemy of our country. It's a serious issue,"" Harris said. ""He is saying that he would use the military to go after them.""
Harris added, ""This is among the reasons I believe so strongly that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America and dangerous.""
Meanwhile, some Republicans attempted to downplay Trump's comments.
Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate, said he thought they were related to illegal migrants -- despite Trump specifically shifting his conversation with Bartiromo away from undocumented immigrants or foreign actors toward who he called ""radical left lunatics.""
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, tried to make a similar argument on CNN, in what turned into a tense exchange with host Jake Tapper as Youngkin said he ""didn't believe"" that Trump was talking about using the military against Democrats.
The Trump campaign, too, suggested the former president's comments were related to immigration.
""The Harris-Biden administration has unconscionably abused our refugee and asylum systems, and turned them into programs to import mass numbers of unvetted migrants from the most dangerous countries on earth, at the expense of Christians and other persecuted religious minorities who those programs were intended to help,"" spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement to ABC News.
Critics expressed concern not only about Trump's comments but how they're being received by the GOP.
""All the time in authoritarian states you see branding of some faction of the political opposition not as loyal opposition but as enemy opposition,"" said Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton University.
Scheppele noted the U.S. has some history with this, such as Republican President Richard Nixon and GOP Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy's abuses of power to go after perceived political foes.
But there is a key distinction between then and now, she said, in that Nixon and McCarthy were ostracized by their peers.
""This one is really different because Trump's got this mass movement and a set of people who are willing to fight for him,"" Scheppele said.
Levitsky said so long as Republicans are standing by Trump, ""democracy is going to be in trouble.""
""I think the most shocking thing is not what Trump said, but the silence that we hear in response to it, particularly among conservative elites who know better, or who should know better,"" Levitsky said.

abcnews,"Democrats, Republicans lining up in new ways in 2024. No one knows what's next.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/parties-coalitions-changing-election-day/story?id=114793336,"""We can't take voters for granted,"" one Democrat said.
The Democratic and Republican Parties' coalitions are undergoing a seismic change just weeks before Vice President Kamala Harris and former PresidentDonald Trumpface off against each other.
What comes after Election Day is anyone's guess.
Harris is overperforming with seniors, sparking speculation she could even win a demographic that has traditionally leaned Republican. Trump, meanwhile, is eating into Democrats' edge with Black and Hispanic voters, particularly males, eroding a gap that has sunk past GOP presidential contenders.
The 2024 presidential election therefore marks not just a key race to see who leads the country but also one of the first contests under what could be brand new dynamics for the parties. Gone, at least for now, are the days of Republicans banking on the support of older voters -- some of the nation's most reliable ballot punchers -- and Democrats' proclamations that demography is destiny.
""The trend lines are that we can't take voters for granted, neither party can take voters for granted. The coalitions are shifting,"" said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic strategist and former communications director for Harris' vice-presidential office.
Poll after poll suggests voter preferences are altering with little time to suss out what the changes mean.
A CNN/SSRS poll released last month showed Harris leading Trump 50-46 among voters 65 years old and up. No Democratic presidential contender has carried that group since Al Gore in 2000.
Meanwhile, a recent Pew poll showed Trump getting 14% support among Black voters and 38% support among Hispanic voters, compared to 79% and 54% for Harris, respectively. In 2020, President Joe Biden won 87% support from Black voters and 65% support from Latinos.
Those numbers are even starker when divided by gender.
Biden won 79% support from Black men and 59% support among Hispanic men four years ago. In the pew poll, those numbers dropped to 72% support for Harris from Black men and 53% support for her from Hispanic men.
The shifting numbers have the campaigns and outside operatives scrambling to figure out why voter preferences are changing the way they are and how long after Nov. 5 that shift will continue.
Strategists in both parties speculated that seniors defecting to Harris are motivated by temperament and healthcare and are potentially spooked by the Jan. 6, 2021, riot on Capitol Hill and repeated Democratic attacks that Republicans will go after long-coveted entitlement programs.
""One is, is that Democrats have done a lot for seniors. Thirty-five-dollar insulin, $2,000 cap on prescription drugs, negotiating with Medicare, etc., etc. They have an advantage on voters trust them on Social Security and Medicare more than Republicans. And I think that there's a qualitative thing, which is, I don't think for seniors, Trump is their type of Republican. They don't like his behavior,"" said John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster who conducts surveys for both Harris' campaign and AARP.
Black and Latino voters, meanwhile, are thought to be leaning more on economic arguments than racial ones that Democrats had long deployed. Those voters, experts said, have defied traditional thinking of voters with uniquely strong cultural concerns and instead are taking into account similar concerns as white working-class voters.
""What you're seeing is this transformation of things like race and ethnicity, where Black and brown voters are increasingly becoming more Republican for reasons that are clearly not racial,"" said Mike Madrid, a GOP strategist who studies and writes about Latino voting patterns. ""This peculiar interaction between race, economic class and diplomas or college education...are happening in very unique ways that are reshaping the coalitions.""
""The Democratic Party is becoming more white, it's becoming less diverse, and where it's concentrating voters is with college-educated white progressives who are much more insulated to the economy and economic shocks and things like inflation and recessions. Those aren't issues for them. What is, is abortion rights, gun control, marriage equality,"" he said.
Economic frustrations are thought to be particularly motivating among men, with whom Trump is consolidating support.
""Democrats have to talk about issues that are important to men, which are very often economic issues, particularly around aspirations. Men want to be able to take care of their families, be contributors to society, and have the standing that comes with a good job or a good business,"" Simmons said.
Each candidate is putting in work to stem their losses.
Trump has boasted of his plan to end taxes on Social Security income, and Harris is waging a full court media blitz to bring Black men back into the fold, appearing on key radio shows and deploying former President Barack Obama to deliver a stern message to those potentially wary of electing a female president.
The country will only have to wait mere weeks to see if those efforts will pay off -- for this election. Even the most veteran operatives aren't sure what happens from Nov. 6 onward.
Trump has said this will be his last race, and his singular hold on the GOP may not be replicated, meaning the day after he leaves the stage -- whenever that happens -- could mark a watershed political moment.
""I think you're asking the right questions. I just don't have all the right answers,"" GOP pollster Whit Ayres said when asked what comes next. ""I am loathe to try to give a prediction about what a party would look like without a figure that has so dominated the party for the last eight years.""
Some strategists think the dynamics will snap back -- with seniors going back to Republicans and voters of color coming home to the Democratic Party, arguing that the unique personalities in this year's race are driving the movement, as seen by more traditional trends playing out in some down-ballot races.
""If he goes away, if we beat him, I think that this whole thing starts lining back up as long as you have a strong Democratic nominee,"" said Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha. ""I don't see all the opportunities once Donald Trump is gone, because the Donald Trump phenomenon is only happening with Donald Trump.""
""I think Trump is seen as better on the economy among a subset of younger voters than most Republicans. So, I think it will be challenging for Republicans writ large to mimic that success,"" added a source familiar with the Harris campaign's thinking.
Others disagreed, noting that the trends that are producing the changes, such as a rise in populism, were bubbling up prior to Trump and will outlive his political career.
""I don't think Trump is the driver of this,"" Madrid said. ""These dynamics began before him.
""I don't think it's as clear as to say one group is going to benefit over the other. I think what we're seeing is the movement of all these pieces away from a right-left spectrum to a top-down spectrum,"" he added.
Still others predicted a whole new ballgame.
Trump has undoubtedly altered America's politics, and, as seen by the failures of some of his primary rivals, his personal brand is difficult to replicate -- meaning without him on a ticket, the country might simply be staring into the political unknown.
""Floodgates open up for there to be competition among subgroups. I absolutely believe that. I think all bets are off. And it just depends on who the candidates are on both sides,"" Anzalone said. ""There may be no snapping back.""

abcnews,Arrest made in connection with FEMA threats in North Carolina,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/threats-fema-workers-north-carolina-sheriff/story?id=114776904,"The man was armed with a handgun and rifle, according to the sheriff's office.
The sheriff's office in Rutherford County, NC, announced Monday that they'd arrested a man and charged him with allegedly threatening to harm Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) workers in the area.
William Parsons, 44, of Bostic, NC, was charged with ""going armed to the terror of the public,"" according to a statement from the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office provided to ABC News.
The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office statement said deputies on Saturday investigated reports in the vicinity of Lake Lure and Chimney Rock that a ""white male had an assault rifle and made the comment about possibly harming FEMA employees"" working in the area. Witnesses were able to provide enough information for law enforcement to ultimately locate and identify Parsons, who was armed with a handgun and a rifle, according to the statement.
Parsons was released Saturday after posting $10,000 bond, according to the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office.
""The initial report stated there was a truckload of militia that was involved. However, after further investigation, it was determined Parsons acted alone and there were no truckloads of militia going to Lake Lure,"" the statement said.
According to SITE Intelligence, which tracks the online activity of extremist organizations, Parsons has promoted the militia group the Three Percenters online.
News of the arrest came one day after the sheriff in Ashe County, NC, about two hours to the north of Rutherford County, said that there had been threats against FEMA employees responding to Hurricane Helene.
""Recently in the mountain region, there have been threats made against them,"" Ashe County Sheriff Phil Howellposted on Facebookregarding the alleged threats against FEMA employees.
""This has not happened in Ashe County or the surrounding counties,"" Howell added. ""Out of an abundance of caution, they have paused their process as they are assessing the threats.""
Sheriff Howell did not specify in his post who allegedly made the threats, nor is it known if Parsons' alleged threat is the one to which Sheriff Howell was referring. An ABC News request for comment sent to the Ashe County Sheriff's Office did not receive an immediate response.
Threats to FEMA employees have been consistent during the Hurricane response, along with misinformation, federal authorities told ABC News.
Search and rescue efforts in the affected areas continue, a federal source told ABC News. However, while FEMA assesses potential threat information, disaster survivor assistance teams are currently working at fixed locations and secure areas instead of going door to door, out of an abundance of caution, the source said, adding that FEMA will monitor threat information and make adjustments to this posture on a regular basis in coordination with local officials.
A FEMA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency continues to support communities impacted by Helene and to help survivors apply for assistance.
""For the safety of our dedicated staff and the disaster survivors we are helping, FEMA has made some operational adjustments,"" the spokesperson said. ""Disaster Recovery Centers will continue to be open as scheduled, survivors continue to register for assistance, and we continue to help the people of North Carolina with their recovery.""
At the direction of North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, the state's Department of Public Safety will assist FEMA conduct their operations.
""We know that significant misinformation online contributes to threats against response workers on the ground, and the safety of responders must be a priority,"" the governor said.  ""At my direction, the North Carolina Department of Public Safety is helping partners like FEMA to coordinate with law enforcement to ensure their safety and security as they continue their important work.""
Sheriff Howell said that FEMA locations in Ashe County are open this week.
""Stay calm and steady during our recovery, help folks and please don't stir the pot,"" he said.
FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told ABC News Friday during a press briefing that threats to FEMA employees are a ""shame"" and a ""distraction.""
""We continuously monitor the social media, channels, other outlets where we're seeing this information, because we want to make sure we're providing for the safest environment for our employees, and making sure that they know that their safety is first and foremost for us as they go out into these communities,"" Criswell said in response to a question from ABC News.
FEMA hires people from local communities when disaster hits, Criswell said, noting that ""many"" leave their families behind to go and help communities who are impacted by disaster.

In an interview on ""Roland Martin Unfiltered,"" also released on Monday, Harris argued that economic policies that consider ""historical barriers"" facing Black people benefit all Americans.
""If you have public policy, and I'm talking about economic public policy specifically at this point, but if you have public policy that recognizes historical barriers and what we need to do then to overcome,"" Harris said. ""First, speak truth about them and then overcome them, that in the process of doing that, not only are you directly dealing with the injustices and the legal and procedural barriers that have been focused on Black folks, but by eliminating those barriers, everyone actually benefits, right?""
The focus on Black voters comes afterformer President Barack Obama sternly chided Black menover ""excuses"" to not vote for Harris while speaking to a group of Black at a campaign field office in Pittsburgh's East Liberty neighborhood last week.
""You have [Trump], who has consistently shown disregard, not just for the communities, but for you as a person, and you're thinking about sitting out?"" Obama asked. ""And you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses?""
Harris is polling ahead of Trump with Black voters who are registered to vote, 82-13%, according tothe latest ABC News/Ipsos poll. That compares with 87-12% in the 2020 exit poll (a slight 5 points lower for Harris; no better for Trump). Black men are at 76-18% (compared with 79-19% four years ago), the poll found.
These differences from 2020 aren't statistically significant, and Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock said he agrees.
""I don't buy this idea that there will be huge swaths of Black men voting for Donald Trump. That's not going to happen. What I would urge folks to do is to show up, to understand that if you don't vote, that is a vote for Donald Trump. That's the concern.,"" said Warnock on a Tuesday campaign call with reporters.
Part of the Harris campaign's plan for Black men includes legalizing recreational marijuana nationwide. Such a move would ""break down unjust legal barriers that hold Black men and other Americans back,"" the campaign said in its release.
This takes the Biden administration's current stance, which includes pardoning people convicted of marijuana possession, a step further. For Harris' part, such a proposal is evidence of her evolving position. She has become more progressive since her time as attorney general of California when she was heavily criticized for aggressively prosecuting weed-related crimes.
Asked if she ever smoked by Charlamagne tha God back in 2019, Harris responded, ""I have. And I inhaled -- I did inhale. It was a long time ago. But, yes.""
She went on to clarify that she believes in legalizing the substance.
""I have had concerns, the full record, I have had concerns, which I think -- first of all, let me just make this statement very clear, I believe we need to legalize marijuana,"" she said. ""Now, that being said -- and this is not a 'but,' it is an 'and' -- and we need to research, which is one of the reasons we need to legalize it. We need to move it on the schedule so that we can research the impact of weed on a developing brain. You know, that part of the brain that develops judgment, actually begins its growth at age 18 through age 24.""
Her answer garnered backlash due to her record prosecuting the substance, particularly given the racial disparities in punishment nationwide. Harris' new proposal looks to correct those historical inequities.
But is it enough?
In addition to the new proposals, Harris has aggressively been campaigning in Black communities in the past week, stopping at several local Black-owned businesses and churches in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan as well as appearing on several media programs with predominately Black audiences.
In September, Harris told a group of Black reporters in a moderated conversationhosted by the National Association of Black Journaliststhat she was ""working to earn the vote, not assuming I'm going to have it because I am Black.""
Her campaign launched a ""Black Men Huddle"" organizing call on Monday, which featured remarks from campaign senior officials Tony West, Brian Nelson, Quentin Fulks and Rep. Cedric Richmond. Later, there was a weekly event focused on Black men supporting Harris featuring actor Don Cheadle.
""What the vice president is doing is giving us the tools to be able to go and have meaningful, impactful conversations when Black men turn back around to us and say, 'Well, what's in it for me,' I think that we have policy and tools like this that we can say exactly that,"" said Fulks.
Doc Rivers, whointerviewed Harris for his ""ALL the SMOKE"" podcast on Monday, said he agreed with Obama's comments last week and pushed for Black men to cast their ballots.
""I agree 100% with President Obama -- it's unacceptable not to vote. When you look back at what your parents and your grandparents had to do to get the right to vote, that's unacceptable for me,"" said Rivers. ""But there are Black men who out there that feel hopeless, they don't believe a vote helps them in either way, and I'm here to tell them they're wrong.""
ABC News interviewed Black men in Pittsburgh's predominately Black Homewood Brushton neighborhood last Friday about their impressions of Harris and what she needed to do to get their vote.
Aquail Bey, a student at The Community College of Allegheny County and president of its veterans club, said Harris needs to meet them where they are and genuinely speak with them.
""She's doing a good job right now, but I think she should have -- go to places where they are, you know, meet them on their own terms, you know. Go to the neighborhoods where they are, go to the barber shops ... "" Bey said. ""Wherever the Black men are, go to where they are, speak to them a way that they understand.""
Aaron Stuckey said people shouldn't assume Black men aren't getting behind Harris.
""Just poll us instead of assuming that that's where we're not going,"" he said.

abcnews,Close fight in the trenches: A look at the ground game in the presidential race: POLL,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/close-fight-trenches-ground-game-presidential-race/story?id=114780589,"Harris and Trump are fighting to parity in voter contacts.
A narrow edge in voter contact by Kamala Harris' campaign at the national level fades to parity in the battleground states -- but Harris has been doing more to turn her contacts into voter assistance, an ABC News/Ipsos poll finds.
Three weeks before Election Day, and with early voting underway in more than 40 states, the level of political outreach is vast. More than four in 10 Americans have been contacted by the Harris or Trump campaigns asking for their vote, rising to 62% in the seven battleground states.
Nationally, 30% report having been contacted by Harris' campaign, vs. 26% by Trump's -- a small edge for Harris. This evens out in the battleground states, where 47% report contacts by Trump's campaign, 46% by Harris'. These counts exclude fundraising appeals -- and surely have grown since this survey was completed last week.
See PDF for full results.
In all, 16% of adults have been contacted nationally by Harris' campaign only, 12% by Trump's only and 14% by both, adding to 42%. In the battlegrounds, it's 15% by Trump only, 14% by Harris only and 32% by both.
There's a gap in terms of voter assistance. Nationally, 43% of those contacted by the Harris campaign say they were offered one of several forms of voting assistance, vs. 35% of those contacted by Trump's campaign. In the battleground states, offers of assistance run 48-39% in Harris' favor, a slight advantage given sample sizes.
Forms of assistance tested in the survey include checking that people are registered to vote, confirming their plans to vote and making sure they know where to vote. In the battlegrounds (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin), people contacted by Harris are 8 percentage points more apt than those contacted by Trump to report help making sure they're registered and 7 points more apt to report an effort to confirm they have voted or will vote, both slight differences given sample sizes. Gaps nationally are similar.
This poll, produced byLanger Research Associatesfor ABC, with fieldwork byIpsos, also finds some signs of more targeted outreach by Harris. Nationally, 46% of Democrats have heard from her campaign, vs. 37% of Republicans contacted by the Trump campaign. And 42% of Harris supporters say her campaign has reached out to them, vs. 35% of Trump's supporters contacted by his side.
Similar to Harris' lead on overall contacts, these gaps disappear in the battleground states. That said, among people in these states who report having voted forJoe Bidenin 2020, 71% report a contact by the Harris campaign this year. Among those who voted for Trump in 2020, fewer, 59%, report a 2024 Trump campaign contact.
Naturally, Harris' campaign has had far more contact than Trump's among Democrats and liberals, while Trump's has done more outreach to Republicans and conservatives. National results also demonstrate campaign targeting in other ways. Three examples:


Among people younger than 40 -- a generally pro-Harris group -- 27% report a Harris campaign contact vs. 19% contacted by the Trump campaign.
By contrast, among white evangelical Protestants, a solidly pro-Trump group, 34% have been contacted by the Trump campaign, vs. 16% by Harris'.

There are inefficiencies on both sides. Nationally, 24% of Trump supporters have been contacted by the Harris campaign asking for their vote, and 21% of Harris supporters have been contacted by the Trump campaign. Misplaced outreach rises in the battlegrounds: There, 44% of Harris supporters have been asked for a Trump vote, and 41% of Trump supporters have heard from the Harris campaign.
Using national data for adequate sample sizes, there are several groups in which Harris' campaign exceeds Trump's in offering assistance to people they've contacted. It's 58% among Black people contacted by Harris' campaign vs. 38% among Black people contacted by Trump's. It's 40% among college graduates contacted by Harris vs. 26% among those contacted by Trump. And the Harris campaign has offered assistance to 42% of independents it's contacted, a potential swing voter group, vs. 32% among independents contacted by the Trump campaign.
Text messages are the most common types of outreach, reported by 61% of those who've heard from either or both of the campaigns. That's followed by email, 43%; postal mail, 36%; social media, 25%; and phone or voicemail, 19%.
Last on the list is the kind of outreach many political scientists say is most effective -- in-person contact, reported by 6%.
The distribution of contact types is similar across the two campaigns overall, albeit with more digital outreach by Harris and more by mail from Trump. Nationally, 84% of her contacts report having heard from her campaign by text, email or on social media vs. 77% of Trump's. Trump, for his part, leads on postal mail outreach, 38 vs. 29%. Distributions look largely similar in the battlegrounds, although both campaigns appear to be focusing more on postal mail; 56% of battleground state respondents who have been contacted by either campaign have been contacted via postal mail vs. 36% nationally.
This ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel® Oct. 4-8, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,631 adults. Partisan divisions are 29-29-30%, Democrats-Republicans-independents. Results have a margin ofsampling errorof plus or minus 2 percentage points, including the design effect, for the full sample. Error margins are larger for subgroups, including 5 points for battleground state residents. Sampling error is not the only cause of differences in polls.

abcnews,Harris calls Trump 'increasingly unstable and unhinged' during Pennsylvania rally,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-calls-trump-increasingly-unstable-unhinged-erie-pennsylvania/story?id=114795103,"Harris played clips of Trump during her campaign stop in Erie on Monday.
Vice PresidentKamala Harrisdeployed a new show-and-tell approach to lambasting former PresidentDonald Trumpat her Monday night rally, playing clips of him calling his opponents the ""enemy within"" and saying that it signaled that he was ""increasingly unstable and unhinged.""
""After all these years, we know who Donald Trump is: He is someone who will stop at nothing to claim power for himself,"" Harris said during her campaign stop in Erie, Pennsylvania.
""And you don't have to take my word for it. I've said, for a while now, watch his rallies, listen to his words,"" she added.
Harris first invited Americans to watch Trump's rallies during the presidential debate hosted by ABC News debate last month.
""He tells us who he is, and he tells us what he would do if he is elected president. So here tonight, I will show you one example of Donald Trump's worldview and intentions,"" Harris said, teeing up the video that played on large monitors at the Erie Insurance Arena.
""The worst people are the enemies from within,"" Trump is seen saying in one clip.
""Now if you had one really violent day, one rough hour, and I mean real rough,"" he says in another.
The presentation marks the introduction of a new element to a Harris rally.
The vice president has quoted Trump's comments before -- as she also did again throughout her speech Monday night -- and has repeatedly asked supporters to watch his events, but she has yet to play a video of them.
""So, you heard his words. You heard his words coming from him. He's talking about the enemy within Pennsylvania. He's talking about the enemy within our country, Pennsylvania,"" Harris said after the clip played.
""He considers anyone who doesn't support him or who will not bend to his will, an enemy of our country,"" Harris warned.
Harris went on to say another Trump term would be ""a huge risk for America and dangerous,"" calling out his positions on reproductive freedoms, climate and LGBTQ+ rights.
The vice president concluded her speech in Pennsylvania with a rallying cry to voters. ""We are all here together because we know what's at stake. And we are here together because we love our country,"" she said.

abcnews,"Walz to campaign with Presidents Obama, Clinton in early-vote push: Sources",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/walz-campaign-presidents-obama-clinton-early-vote-push/story?id=114814686,"Walz will be in North Carolina with Clinton and in Wisconsin with Obama.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, for the first time this cycle, will soon hit the campaign trail with former President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton, according to a senior campaign official.
The vice presidential nominee will be out with his party's former standard bearers this week and next week in an effort to push for early voting in battleground states, ABC News has exclusively learned.
The governor will first rally with Clinton in Durham, North Carolina, on Thursday -- the first day of early voting in the critical battleground state. Next Tuesday, Walz will travel to Wisconsin, another battleground, with Obama for the start of early voting in that state.
The joint campaign blitzes come as the Harris-Walz ticket has deployed both former presidents -- some of its strongest political assets -- headed into the final stretch of the election cycle.
Obama hit the trail for the ticket starting on Oct. 10 and has additional stops planned in the run-up toElectionDay, according to the campaign.
His first stop was in battleground Pennsylvania in the Pittsburgh area -- a visit wherehe sternly chided Black menover ""excuses"" to not vote for Harris, saying he finds them sitting out or voting for former President Donald Trump ""not acceptable.""
Obama will also independently hit the campaign trail in the Sun Belt this week, with stops on Friday in Arizona and on Saturday in Nevada -- the first days of early voting in the state.
On Sunday and Monday, Clinton made his trail debut with travel across rural communities in Eastern and South Georgia to encourage Georgians to vote early.
Last night, on the eve ofearly in-person voting in the state, Clinton stumped for the Harris-Walz ticket in battleground Georgia, mounting the stakes of the election and the importance of voting.
""I want you to be happy, and I want you to know that I am here because I believe. I believe, based on my personal knowledge of the job and the candidates, that Kamala Harris will be a fine president,"" he said.
""All we gotta do is show up. If we show up, we'll win,"" Clinton added.
The joint principal campaign events also come as Walz himself has made campaign stops related to early voting. The governor campaigned last week in Phoenix and Tucson on the first day of early voting in Arizona.
""I know you've started voting here in Arizona. It's happening across the country. We can make a difference. And I think just the idea of having an administration building on these strong relationships, this is our opportunity to take this to the next level that we need to do,"" Walz said at event with tribal leaders in Chandler, Arizona last Wednesday.

abcnews,"Arizona counties don't have to do citizenship checks before election, judge rules",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/arizona-counties-wont-forced-citizenship-checks-election-judge-114831464,"Those who sought the checks made their request too close to the election.
PHOENIX --A judge has rejected a request to require Arizona's 15 counties to verify the citizenship of some 42,000 voters registered only to vote in federal elections in the presidential battleground state, concluding those who sought the checks made their request too close to the Nov. 5 election and didn’t have legal standing.
A lawsuit filed on behalf of an Arizona voter and the conservative advocacy group Strong Communities Foundation of Arizona sought a court order requiring county recorders to ask federal authorities to verify the citizenship of those voters.
Arizona requires voters to prove their citizenship to participate in local and state races. Voters who don’t provide proof of citizenship yet still swear they are U.S. citizens are allowed to vote only for president, the U.S. House or Senate.
The lawsuit alleged officials weren’t complying with a 2022 law requiring the cross-checking of registration information with various government databases.
“They (the plaintiffs) have not made a clearcut showing of harm, nor that the action they request is feasible in the midst of a general election,” U.S. District Judge Krissa Lanham wrote in an order issued Friday.
Lanham, a nominee of President Joe Biden, said she was declining to force county recorders to divert resources away from preparing for the election and toward citizenship checks just weeks before Election Day.
The plaintiffs told the court that they intend to appeal the ruling.
America First Legal, which is run by former Donald Trump adviser Stephen Miller and represents the plaintiffs, said in a statement Tuesday that the appeal effort was made “to demand potential illegal aliens and noncitizens are lawfully removed from the Arizona voter rolls.”
Taylor Kinnerup, a spokeswoman for Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, declined to comment on the judge’s order.
The lawsuit alleged it wasn’t enough for county officials to consult the databases and said officials should ask federal authorities to verify the voters’ citizenship status.
After it was pointed out that federal law bars systematic voter-list purges within 90 days of an election, the plaintiffs clarified that they were merely asking that a letter be sent to federal officials inquiring about the citizenship of federal-only voters, according to Lanham. The plaintiffs noted they weren’t seeking the removal of people from voter rolls.
The 42,000 voters at issue in the lawsuit are separate from a much larger group of voters whose citizenship hasn’t been confirmed yet will still be allowed to vote in local, state and federal elections in November, according to the office of Secretary of State Adrian Fontes.
About a month ago, officials uncovered a database error that hadmistakenly designated nearly 98,000 votersas having access to the full ballot, even though their citizenship status hadn’t been confirmed.
Driver licenses issued after 1996 are considered valid documented proof of citizenship, but the system error marked the original batch of voters who had pre-1996 licenses as eligible to vote in state and local elections.
The state Supreme Court concluded those voters, who were already able to vote in the federal races,could vote in state and local racesfor the 2024 general election.
A little more than a week later, the number of misclassified votersjumped from almost 98,000 to around 218,000. Fontes' office has said all people included in the database error remain eligible to vote a full ballot.

Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Republican challenger David McCormick are meeting for their second debate
HARRISBURG, Pa. --Democratic U.S. Sen.Bob Caseyof Pennsylvania and Republican challengerDavid McCormickmeet for their second debate Tuesday evening, with control of the Senate on the line and tens of millions of dollars pouring into the race every week.
During theirfirst debatetwo weeks ago, Casey tried to drive home the message that McCormick is a wealthy,carpetbaggingex-hedge fund CEO whogot richat the expense of Americans and will serve the interests of billionaires.
McCormick painted Casey as a weak, do-nothing out-of-touch career politician who will vote almost 100% of the time with PresidentJoe Bidenand Vice PresidentKamala Harris.
Mail-in voting has already begun in the pivotal swing-state seat, and the outcome of this race, one of the nation’s most expensive, could help determine which party controls the narrowly divided Senate.
Casey, perhaps Pennsylvania’s best-known politician, is seeking a fourth term in what he calls his toughest reelection challenge yet.
Casey, 64, supported Biden's major initiatives, including his$1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, and is a staunch ally of labor unions. The former state auditor general and treasurer has won six statewide elections and is Pennsylvania’s longest-serving Democrat in the Senate. He has campaigned on preserving the middle class,abortion rights, labor rights and voting rights — and calls McCormick and former PresidentDonald Trumpa threat to all those.
McCormick, 59, is making his second run for the Senate afterlosing narrowlyto Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022’s Republican primary. He was CEO of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, sat on Trump’s Defense Advisory Board and served in top positions under President George W. Bush. Those included posts as a Commerce undersecretary tasked with policy over controlling exports of sensitive technologies and a Treasury undersecretary as the administration tried to prevent bank failures during the recession.
McCormick backs Trump's pledge to extend the tax cuts he signed into law in 2017 and to carry out a mass deportation of immigrants who are in the country without permission — prioritizing people with criminal records. McCormick also opposes abortion rights, but said he wouldn't vote for a national ban on abortion.
Issues aroundborder policyand theIsrael-Hamas warare prominent in the race.
Democrats currently hold a Senate majority by the narrowest of margins, but facea difficult 2024 Senate map.
More than $190 million has been spent on this single race so far, according disclosures to the Federal Election Commission. The total is on track to exceed $320 million, based on campaign ad tracking by AdImpact, which includes spots reserved between now and Election Day.
The 60-minute debate will air starting at 7 p.m., hosted byWPVI-TV in Philadelphia, which will broadcast it live.Univision 65in Philadelphia will simulcast it with Spanish language translation. Both stations will stream it live online, as willABC News Liveand Univision'sVIX.
Both Casey and McCormickwere uncontestedfor their party’s nominations. Also on the ballot in this race are John Thomas of the Libertarian Party, Leila Hazou of the Green Party and Marty Selker of the Constitution Party. They were not invited to the debate.

abcnews,"Economic discontent, issue divisions add up to tight presidential contest: POLL",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/economic-discontent-issue-divisions-add-tight-presidential-contest/story?id=114723390,"Harris has 50% support to Trump’s 48% among likely voters, the poll finds.
Dreary economic attitudes and sharply divergent views on social policies mark the 2024 presidential election, contributing to a tighter contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump: Just 2 percentage points now divide them in a new ABC News/Ipsos poll.
Harris has 50% support to Trump's 48% among likely voters in the national survey, with a similar 49-47% result among all registered voters. (Among all adults, regardless of registration status, it's a single-point race, 49-48%, excluding those who wouldn't vote.)
The results are slightly closer than Harris' +5 points among likely voters and the general public, and +4 among registered voters, in the last ABC/Ipsos poll in mid-September. A gain for Trump among men -- he's now +8 points among those registered to vote -- is a factor, as is a slip for Harris among independents, often swing voters.
See PDF for full results.
Beneath the horse race, issues pull in opposite directions. The poll, produced for ABC News byLanger Research Associates, with fieldwork by Ipsos, finds that 56% of Americans now favor deporting all undocumented immigrants, up 20 points from eight years ago. That reinforces one of Trump's strongest issues, with a 10-point Trump lead in trust to handle immigration at the southern border.
Yet the same share, 56%, side with Harris on abortion, saying the federal government should restore access to what it was before the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. Many fewer, 41%, favor Trump's view that each state should decide. It follows that abortion is Harris' best issue in this poll, with a 15-point lead over Trump in trust on it.
Then there's the economy, and related to it, a sharp division on the nation's future. As reportedFriday, 44% of Americans say they're not as well off now as they were when Biden took office, tying the most negative number on this question in data since 1986.
Further, while inflation has eased and employment is strong, those gains haven't hit home for most people: 59% say the economy is getting worse, more than twice as many as say it's getting better, 23%. And among registered voters who say the economy's worsening, Trump leads Harris by a sweeping 53 points, 74-21%.
Largely informed by economic attitudes, registered voters divide, 51-47%, on whether America's best days are still ahead, or behind it. This in turn relates to candidate choice: Trump, with his message of national decay, leads Harris by 27 points, 61-34%, among those who say the country's best days are behind it. Harris, with her more optimistic messaging, leads Trump by 28 points, 63-35%, among those who think America's best days are ahead.
Taken another way, 59% of Trump's supporters say the country's best days are behind it. Among Harris supporters, 67% say the country's best days are still to come.
Trump leads Harris by 8 points overall in trust to handle the economy and 7 points on inflation, consistent results since August that are central to his competitiveness and reflect Harris' challenges breaking free from dissatisfaction with Biden's economic stewardship. (See more on this inFriday's reporton Harris' headwinds as an agent of change.)
That said, Harris pushes back on another economic benchmark, ""looking out for the middle class."" A new item in this poll, she leads Trump on it by 5 points, 42-37%. (The rest don't trust either of them to handle it.)
A test of three economic proposals from each candidate fills out the story: Trump has both the most popular and the least popular proposals, with Harris winning the second, third and fourth slots of the six.
Specifically, Trump's suggestion to end income taxes on Social Security benefits leads in popularity, followed by three from Harris -- a tax credit for middle- and lower-income families with newborns, a limit on the profits food companies can make on groceries and grants to first-time home buyers. Two more Trump proposals come next -- raising tariffs on foreign imports, and the one that is unpopular among most people, cutting corporate income taxes.
One of these -- the idea to end taxes on Social Security benefits -- rises to the level of majority ""strong"" support, 55%. Harris' three proposals also get more strong support than strong opposition, by 10 to 23 points. Trump's remaining items, by contrast, get much less strong support -- and cutting corporate income taxes is more apt to be strongly opposed.
In trust on other issues, Trump holds single-digit leads on handling crime and safety, national security and the conflict in the Middle East; Harris has a single-digit lead on ""protecting American democracy."" Results for items repeated from past polls are virtually unchanged.
While potential voters are closely divided on many points, enthusiasm and personal favorability are two areas in which Harris has clear advantages. Among registered voters who support her, 84% say they're enthusiastic about it; among Trump supporters, enthusiasm drops by 6 points, to 78%. That's markedly lower than enthusiasm for Trump -- 93% -- at this point in 2020.
Enthusiasm is related to personal favorability, and 44% of Americans see Harris favorably, vs. 35% for Trump. Harris' favorability rating lost 3 points in this poll, and 47% now see her unfavorably. That said, many more, 58%, have an unfavorable opinion of Trump.
Favorability isn't determinative. Trump has been underwater in favorability consistently since 2015 -- but won the Electoral College eight years ago regardless.
One important boost to Trump is that, among the 15% of registered voters who see both candidates unfavorably, he leads by a wide margin, 62-24%. Looking at it another way, 21% of Trump's supporters see him unfavorably, but support him anyway. The corresponding figure for Harris is just 7%.
Trump also continues to score a few points by portraying Harris as too liberal. Forty-eight percent of Americans see her this way, vs. 43% who call Trump too conservative. That said, 7% call Harris too conservative and 9% call Trump too liberal; at the end of the day, very similar numbers call them ""about right"" ideologically, 43% for Trump, 41% for Harris.
However much they're liked or disliked, another result shows that most people are ready to hear more from the candidates: 57% say Harris and Trump should agree to an additional televised debate, while 41% say not.
Trump reiterated last week that another debate is not in the cards. And there's a difference on the question between their supporters. Among registered voters who prefer Harris, 71% are looking for another debate, while among those who prefer Trump, this drops sharply, to 45%. (After their sole debate last month, 58% overall thought Harris had won it.)
With the election close to three weeks away, partisanship infuses survey results. Eighty-five percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the economy is getting worse, for instance, while just 32% of Democrats and Democratic leaners agree. In another example, Republicans and GOP leaners are far more apt than their Democratic counterparts to say the country's best days have passed, 60% vs. 36%.
Policy preferences show similar patterns. Eighty-eight percent of Republicans support mass deportation, as do 58% of independents, compared with 26% of Democrats. (That said, support for deportations has increased broadly compared with a 2016 survey, with the exception of views among Democrats and liberals.)
On abortion, partisan divisions results are reversed: Eighty-seven percent of Democrats say the federal government should restore abortion access, as do 57% of independents, dropping to 27% of Republicans.
Polls are best used not to recite who's ahead, but to assess how and why the country is coming to its decision. It's also important to keep in mind that the ultimate winner of the popular vote may differ from the winner of the presidency, as demonstrated in 2016 and 2000 (and likewise, for history buffs, in 1888, 1876 and 1824).
With Election Day drawing close and early voting underway, this poll includes slight departures from previous ABC/Ipsos polls this cycle in measuring vote preferences. Survey respondents are offered up to five candidates -- Harris, Trump, Jill Stein, Chase Oliver and Cornel West, and their running mates -- based on which of those candidates are on the ballot in the state where the respondent lives. (Robert F. Kennedy Jr., while on the ballot in 30 states and the District of Columbia, is not listed, since he's not actively running. Respondents can volunteer their support for Kennedy or anyone else.)
In addition to being asked whom they'd support, respondents are given the option of saying they already voted. In this survey 1% had done so, a number likely to ramp up quickly.
As mentioned, one shift in this poll is the result among men who are registered to vote -- 52-44% in Trump's favor, compared with a dead heat, 48-48%, in mid-September. That includes a 19-point Trump lead among white men and a close contest among Hispanic men and younger men (age 18-39) alike.
A slight change is among independents, who, per exit polls, have voted for the winner in nine out of the last 12 presidential elections. Harris led among independents by 10 points, 51-41%, in mid-September, compared with a non-significant 5 points now, 49-44%.
Harris, for her part, continues to lead among women by 9 points, 53-44%, aided by her showing among under-40, Black and Hispanic women. And she leads by 14 points among college graduates, 56-42%, among the more reliable groups for turnout.
The 17-point gender gap between the candidates (Trump +8 among men, Harris +9 among women) is back to its typical level; it has averaged 19 points in exit polls since 1996. This reflects the fact that women are 8 points more apt than men to identify as Democrats.
The contest stands at 82-13%, Harris-Trump, among Black people who are registered to vote; that compares with 87-12% in the 2020 exit poll (a slight 5 points lower for Harris; no better for Trump). Black women are at 87-10% now (compared with 90-9% in 2020); Black men are at 76-18% (compared with 79-19% four years ago). These differences from 2020 aren't statistically significant.
Then there's the division of votes by state groupings. In what are thought to be safely and likely red states, Trump is comfortably ahead, 55-42%. In expected blue states, Harris is well ahead, 56-39%. And in the seven battleground states where the contest is expected to be close -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- it couldn't be closer: 49% for Harris, 49% for Trump.

abcnews,Vance stands by Trump's false claims Venezuelan gangs have invaded Colorado,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/vance-stands-trumps-false-claims-venezuelan-gangs-aurora/story?id=114751512,"The Republican mayor of the city has said the claims are grossly exaggerated.
GOP vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance is standing by former PresidentDonald Trump'sfalse claims that Venezuelan gangs have invaded and conquered Aurora, Colorado.
Trump has repeatedly claimed that members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang have ""taken over"" apartment complexes and ""overrun"" the city, as he did in arally in the cityon Friday.
Mike Coffman, the Republican mayor of Aurora, said Trump's claims are ""grossly exaggerated"" and ""have unfairly hurt the city's identity and sense of safety.""
Asked by ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday if he supports Trump making those claims, Vance did not back down.
""Well, Martha, you just said the mayor said they were exaggerated. That means there's got to be some element of truth here,"" Vance said.""
Raddatz followed up with Vance, saying the issues in Aurora were limited to a handful of apartment complexes and that the mayor released a statement saying the city's ""dedicated police officers have acted on those concerns and will continue to do so.""
Vance responded, saying Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris caused the issues in Aurora.
""Unfortunately, when you let people in by the millions, most of whom are unvetted, most of whom you don't know who they really are, you're going to have problems like this.""
""Kamala Harris, 94 executive orders that undid Donald Trump's successful border policies. We knew this stuff would happen. Bragged about opening the border, and now we have the consequences, and we're living with it. We can do so much better, but frankly, we're not going to do better, Martha, unless Donald Trump calls this stuff out. I'm glad that he did.""
In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which devastated parts of states in the southeastern U.S., including Florida, North Carolina, and Georgia,Trump has falsely suggestedthat aid from FEMA meant for the hurricane was going to migrants and that the federal government is going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas.
Asked if he believed that true, Vance defended the president.
""What the President said is that fundamentally, FEMA aid is distracted by going to illegal migrants,"" Vance responded. ""We've got Republican congressmen who are on the ground who represent that area saying that they have to call the White House to get food and water to FEMA? I don't, frankly, think there's anything malicious going on here, Martha, but I do think that we've had an incompetent response to this particular crisis, particularly in Western North Carolina, which, to be fair, was hit harder than a lot of us expected it.""
Vance called the federal government's response to the crisis incompetent, saying members of the military are still ""trickling"" into western North Carolina.
Raddatz pushed back against the false claims that the government is not assisting people in Republican areas and citing Pentagon officials who said that active duty troops were staged and ready to go before being called upon and were instantly out the door.
On Friday in Georgia, Vance said that the attorney general is the second-most important government role after the president.
Raddatz pressed Vance if Trump would go after his political opponents if he won another term.
""No, he was president for four years, and he didn't go after his political opponents. You know, who did go after her political opponents? Kamala Harris, who has tried to arrest everything from pro-life activists to her political opponents,"" Vance said.
To follow up, Raddatz told Vance that Trump has said in the past that those who have cheated will be prosecuted.
""Well, he said that people who violated our election laws will be prosecuted. I think that's the administration of law,"" Vance said. ""He didn't say people are going to go to jail because they disagree with me.""
Vance continues to refuse to acknowledge that Trump lost the 2020 election. In an interview with ""This Week"" earlier this year, Vance said he wouldn't have certified the results of the 2020 race until states submitted pro-Trump electors.
Raddatz pressed Vance again on the 2020 election.
""In interview after interview, question after question, and in the debate, you refuse to say that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election,"" Raddatz said. ""So I'm just going to assume that if I ask you 50 times whether he lost the election, you would not acknowledge that he did. Is that correct?""
""Martha, you've you asked this question. I've been asked this question 10 times in the past couple of weeks. Of course, Donald Trump and I believe there were problems in 2020,"" Vance said.
Pressed again by Raddatz, Vance replied, ""I've said repeatedly I think the 2020 election had problems. You want to say rigged? You want to say he won? Use whatever vocabulary term you want.""

LAS VEGAS --Vice PresidentKamala Harriswas asked to name three virtues that her opponent in next month's election,Donald Trump, possesses — but was unable to come up with even one.
At the end of hertown hall for Spanish-language network Univisionin Las Vegas on Thursday, audience member Teresa Djedjro, 48 and originally born in Mexico, asked Harris to, ""Please give me three virtues that Trump has.”
Harris laughed and thanked her for the question before saying, “I know that the vast majority of us has so much more in common than what separates us.” Then she made clear that is not the case for herself and the former president, saying Trump's approach to politics, “pains me” while singling out his ”us versus them” approach.
“I don’t think that's healthy for our nation, and I don’t admire that,"" Harris said. ""And I’m quite critical of it, coming from someone who wants to be president of the United States.”
Taking another stab at a compliment, she offered, “I think Donald Trump loves his family and I think that’s very important,"" only to continue, ""But I don’t really know him. I only met him one time ... so I don’t really have much more to offer you.”
Trump is holding his own Univision town hall next week, after the original gathering in Miami was postponed due to Hurricane Milton. Still, he too has had little nice to say about Harris during the campaign, calling her “mentally impaired.”

abcnews,Trump outpaces Harris and Walz in campaign events as Election Day approaches,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-outpaces-harris-walz-campaign-events-run-final/story?id=113932634,"In September, Trump held 21 public events compared to Harris' 13.
As former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris spend the run-up to the last stretch of the 2024 election barnstorming through battleground states, a contrast has emerged: Trump has single-handedly outpaced both Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in campaign events for the month of September as he shows no signs of slowing down -- a strategy his campaign is employing to focus on counties vulnerable to flipping.
In September, Trump held 21 public campaign events including remarks, rallies, press conferences and town halls. That's compared to Harris' 13 campaign events; Walz had seven campaign events, according to campaign schedules ABC News has reviewed. On top of Trump's jam-packed campaign schedule, his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, alone held 14 events in the month of September.
These tallies do not include brief campaign retail stops and appearances without remarks.
The intensity in Trump's campaign schedule has continued into the first week of October. From Oct. 1 through Oct. 6, Trump has already held eight campaign events compared to Harris, who has held two, according to an ABC News review of their schedules.
Recently Harris has spent her days focused on her official duties as vice president receiving Federal Emergency Management Agency briefings and surveying Hurricane Helene's damage in Georgia and North Carolina. Trump similarly visited Georgia to survey the storm damage and received his own briefings from local officials.
Harris campaign advisers have dismissed arguments that Harris isn't campaigning hard enough, pointing to the eight events she had done throughout the month in her official capacity as vice president including a trip down to the southern border along with dealing with the devastation from Hurricane Helene.
Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement that Trump is ""cocooned in a conservative media bubble"" and ""limiting his time in battleground states,"" while Harris and Walz are ""taking tough questions and meeting voters where they are.""
""In the home stretch, Donald Trump is campaigning in California, Chicago, and New York City, after camping out at Mar-A-Lago avoiding voters,"" Chitika wrote in the statement.
However, in recent weeks, Trump has been campaigning across multiple battleground states, which have included multiple appearances in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina, as he enters a crucial phase of his campaign and vies to make a final pitch to voters ahead of Election Day.
""I go to a lot of places, we're definitely outworking the opposition. She'll go to one place in three days. I say, 'Why can't I do that?'"" Trump quipped at a campaign stop in Savannah, Georgia, late last month.
Earlier this election cycle, Trump was falling behind in the number of campaign events compared to his nonstop rallying during the 2016 election. Trump, who had early victories in primary races, had fewer events amid his legal battles, which kept him confined in a courtroom most days of the week.
But he has picked up the pace in the final months ahead of the election.
The former president has spent most of his time in the past month in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, holding four events in September there as polling shows it's the closest state on the map between the two candidates. Harris only has a 0.4% lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, according to538's polling average.
Trump's events have been concentrated in urban-suburban areas in battleground states that flipped between his two presidential runs as his campaign hopes to eat away at Democratic margins.
For example, last month, Trump gave remarks at a manufacturing plant in Walker, Michigan, in Kent County -- a county that President Joe Biden flipped from Trump in 2020. Later in the day, Trump hosted a town hall in Warren, Michigan, which sits just outside of Detroit and was the only county in 2020 in the tri-county region that flipped to Trump in the past two cycles after former President Barack Obama won the county in 2008 and 2012.
Two weeks ago, Trump visited Prairie Du Chien in Crawford County, Wisconsin -- a southwest county in the state that is among several in the region that flipped from Obama to Trump. Now, Trump is trying to win back voters in these pivotal counties after he narrowly lost the state to Biden by 21,000 votes in 2020.
Last week, Trump marked his fourth visit to Wisconsin in eight days with events in Milwaukee and Dane counties -- two Democratic strongholds. He went on to campaign on Sunday in Juneau, Wisconsin, in Dodge County -- a county that has increasingly been turning into a Republican stronghold over the last few presidential elections.
Harris has similarly focused on Pennsylvania, holding five events in the commonwealth. She has spent much of her time in Western and central Pennsylvania, drawing crowds from both the Democratic-leaning Pittsburgh area as well as rural counties that have been wavering between strong and slight Republican leanings.
The schedule contrast comes as the Harris campaign, and previously Biden's, have been critical of Trump's slow pace on the road earlier in the cycle, arguing he was campaigning from ""his country club basement.""
In the early weeks of August, on the heels of Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 election, Trump only had a smattering of events in Republican-safe states, spending most of his time at private fundraisers and participating in online interviews including with tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and streamer Adin Ross.
Harris began introducing herself to the nation by holding multiple events in the beginning weeks of her campaign and drawing big crowds from that momentum -- especially in the second week of August when the Harris-Walz ticket held five joint rallies across the country -- but has since failed to keep up with that pace. At times, Harris has focused on her official duties as vice president instead or simply had no public campaign or vice presidential schedules announced.
Additionally, Harris and Walz have both received public scrutiny for their careful campaigning methods, both largely avoiding media availability on the road and sit-down interviews, something the Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance both routinely do.
Recently, however, the Harris-Walz campaign has announced a series of media interviews including appearances on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, ABC's ""The View,"" CBS News' ""60 Minutes,"" and the ""Howard Stern Show"" for Harris. Walz is set to do interviews on the ""Smartless"" podcast and ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" this week.
Thelatest polling average from 538shows Harris is gaining momentum nationally, leading Trump by 2.6%, but a recentNew York Times/Siena College pollshows a tighter race with the two candidates neck-and-neck among registered voters in Michigan and Wisconsin. AnotherNew York Times/Siena College polla week prior showed Trump leading in the battleground states of Arizona and North Carolina.
As he enters the final stages of the campaign, Trump has publicly acknowledged the importance of the last weeks of his campaign, often telling his supporters that he isn't taking anything for granted. Trump's campaign has said the former president is aware of the stakes of the election as he enters the final stages and hopes his message on immigration and economy -- two key issues for voters this election -- resonate.
Trump has said he plans to leave everything on the field as Election Day draws near.
""We're going to leave nothing to chance and everything on the field … and we're going to defeat Kamala Harris, and we're going to make America great again,"" Trump said at a campaign stop in Waunakee, Wisconsin, last week.
Harris, going into the final stretch of the election, has stressed that she's running as an ""underdog"" in what's shaping up to be a close race.
""This is a margin-of-error race. We are the underdog. And I am running like the underdog because I am the underdog in this race. The baton is now in our hands,"" Harris said at a fundraiser in San Francisco in late September.
While falling behind Trump in formal campaign remarks, the Harris campaign has filled their schedule for both candidates with retail campaign stops, seeing value in fostering environments where their candidates can have more face time with voters, as well as fundraisers that has allowed them to wipe out Trump's campaign money edge from earlier this year.

President Bidentravels to his native state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday, as he serves as the main attraction at the Philadelphia Democratic City Committee's autumn fundraising dinner.
And first lady Jill Biden will be in suburban Philadelphia – as she headlines an afternoon event in Chester County and then speaks in the evening in Montgomery County, where she grew up.
The first lady is campaigning on behalf of Harris in the seven key swing states whose razor-thin margins decided her husband's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine if Harris or Trump succeed Biden in the White House.

Biden's latest campaign trail foray for fellow Democrats comes amid reports of a lack of coordination between political advisers to the president and the vice president.
TENSIONS ALLEGEDLY RISE BETWEEN BIDEN AND HARRIS AIDES
The appearances by both Bidens also come a day after the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees campaignedin Pennsylvania, with Harris holding two events in Erie, in the northwest corner of the state, and Trump in suburban Philadelphia, in the southeastern portion of the commonwealth.

It was the vice president's 10th visit to Pennsylvania since replacing Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in mid-July. Trump's also been a frequent visitor, with rallies in Scranton and Reading less than a week ago.
Pennsylvania, along with Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada, had razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump. And the seven states will likely determine whether Harris or Trump wins the 2024presidential election.

But with 19 electoral votes at stake, Pennsylvania's the biggest of the key battlegrounds. And while the campaigns and their allied super PACs are pouring resources into all seven states, more money has been spent running spots in Pennsylvania than any of the other battlegrounds, according to figures from AdImpact, a top national ad tracking firm.

foxnews,Trump says GOP is 'party of common sense' during contentious Bloomberg interview,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-gop-party-common-sense-during-contentious-bloomberg-interview,"Former President Trump details his foreign policy and trade policies on ‘Sunday Morning Futures.’
Former President Trump said theRepublican Partyis ""the party of common sense"" Tuesday during a contentious interview with Bloomberg News in Chicago.
Trump sat for an interview with Bloomberg News’ editor-in-chief John Micklethwait at the Economic Club of Chicago. The two discussed Trump’s plans forthe economyin a potential second term during a heated interview that lasted nearly an hour.
Micklethwait spoke about the economy to start, but later got into the state of the presidential race, asking the former president which state he believed was most critical to deciding the election.

TRUMP REVEALS WHICH ELECTION ISSUE IS A 'BIGGER DEAL' THAN INFLATION AND THE ECONOMY
""They say Pennsylvania. I think we’re doing very well there. I think you look at Michigan, too, and I’m doing very well,"" Trump said. ""We’re way up in Pennsylvania. We’re way up in Michigan. We’re doing very well in Arizona. In fact, somebody said they’re going to pull the plug in Arizona – they’re going to give it up because it looks like we’re quite a ways ahead.""
A RealClearPolitics polling average as of Tuesday afternoon showed Trump slightly ahead in Pennsylvania, as well as in Arizona and Michigan.
Trump went on to say that the Republican Party is ""the party of common sense.""
""Forget about conservative, liberal. We’re, let’s say, conservative, but we’re really a party of ‘We need borders. We need fair elections. We don’t want men playing in women’s sports. We don’t want transgender operations without parental consent,’"" Trump explained. ""It is 99.9% common sense. It really is common sense. I say we’re really a party of common sense, and we want to have great people in our country.""
Trump added: ""I have a good heart. I have a heart where I want people to be taken care of. But I don’t want to take in people where millions of people – 21 million people at least have come in the last three and a half years unvetted, unchecked. We don’t know anything about them.""

Micklethwait began Tuesday's interview by claiming Trump’s economic plan would drive up debt and inflation, with the former president claiming that he served in office without inflation.
""Yeah, I had four years – no inflation,"" Trump said.
Micklethwait also hit Trump on his plan for tariffs on foreign goods, but Trump fired back, explaining that foreign countries will pay a ""100% tariff on everything sold into the United States.""
FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS LOSES HER LEAD AND A NEW ELECTORATE EMERGES
Earlier this year, Trump rolled out a plan to eliminateChina's most favored nation trade statusand impose universal baseline 10% tariffs on imports. In private, Trump has even floated tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese goods. Economists have warned that increasing tariffs would also cause an increase in prices for everyday goods due to American companies relying on cheap raw materials from China.
Micklethwait said Trump’s plans would ""have a serious effect on the overall economy.""
""It’s going to have a massive effect – positive effect. It’s going to be a positive effect,"" Trump replied. ""It must be hard for you to spend 25 years talking about tariffs as being negative and then have somebody explain to you that you’re totally wrong.""
Micklethwait fired back at Trump, saying he could be ""plunging America into the biggest trade war.""
""No, there are no tariffs – all you have to do is build your plant in the United States and you don't have any tariffs,"" Trump said. ""That's what I want.""
The former president's response was met with applause from the audience.
""The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States and build a factory in the United States so it doesn't have to pay the tariff,"" Trump explained.
As for national security and foreign policy, Trump touted his relationships with adversaries, like Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying the United States was respected under his administration.
Trump was asked if he would send American troops to defend Taiwan if China invaded. The Chinese military are currently engaged in rehearsals for a naval blockade of the island nation.
""The reason they're doing it now is because they're not going to do it afterward,"" Trump said – a response met with applause from the audience.
Trump was also asked if he has spoken to Putin since he left office, to which he replied: ""I don’t comment on that.""

""But I will tell you that if I did, it’s a smart thing,"" Trump said. ""If I’m friendly with people, if I can have a relationship with people, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing, in terms of a country.""

The campaign added: ""Kamala could NEVER.""
The Trump campaign touted the former president's responses and policies, and added: ""President Trump did it once with record success – and he'll do it again.""

Mike Waltz, R-Fla., debated loaded terms like ‘fascist’ and ‘socialist’ that have been used to describe the two presidential candidates.
CNN anchor John Berman andRep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., got into a tense exchange Tuesday morning over politically charged terms like ""fascist"" and ""socialist"" that have been used to describe the two presidential candidates.
At a recent rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, Vice President Kamala Harris played a mashup of clips in which Trump warned ofdangers from ""the enemy within.""
""The worst people are the enemies from within... those people are more dangerous; the enemy within; than Russia and China. These people should be put in jail the way they talk about our judges and our justices,"" Trump collectively stated in some of the television clips played.
In recent comments on the matter toFox Business'Maria Bartiromo, Trump spoke about such ""enemies,"" and quipped that while China and Russia are ""dangerous"" at times to deal with, ""the thing that's tougher to handle are these lunatics that we have inside like Adam Schiff.""

Schiff, a congressman from Burbank, Calif., is currently the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate against Republican retired MLB star Steve Garvey.
During an interview on ""CNN News Central,"" Berman asked Waltz whether it was ""responsible"" for Trump to make such comments.
Waltz claimed that Trump was talking about issues that are ""detrimental"" to democracy in the United States and undermine public trust in institutions. For example, he claimed that Schiff, a senior House Intelligence Committee member, leaked information from compartmented hearings and lied to the public in open hearings.
Berman then referenced the ""lunatic"" comment directed at Schiff and suggested that Trump was also talking about dealing with ""lunatics"" in a hypothetical military deployment.
""John, people were on this network calling Trump Hitler and the next coming of another dictator and two people have tried to kill him. We have the Iranians trying to kill him. A foreign adversary trying to assassinate him and we're talking about him playing music in a rally,"" Waltz said.
Berman acknowledged that while it is essential to talk about heated rhetoric directed at Trump, Waltz himself has suggested that Harris is a ""socialist.""

""So, these phrases do get tossed around,"" Berman added.
Waltz said that socialism is a ""longstanding political ideology"" and very different from claiming that Trump would be ""the world's most god-awful dictator"" and Hitler. Waltz also contended that such language is radicalizing people to take action.
He also noted that some members of Congress have referred to themselves as ""democratic socialists"" and insisted that Berman was not making a ""fair comparison.""
""You don't?"" Berman asked. ""You talk about Marxism. You talk about socialism. And do you think Kamala Harris is a Marxist or a socialist?""

Waltz said that he believes Marxism is ""underpinning"" some of Harris' policies, such as price controls.
Berman then tried to draw a comparison between Waltz's comments about Harris andretired Gen. Mark Milley'sremarks about Trump.
Milley reportedly said, ""No one has ever been as dangerous to this country as Donald Trump… Now I realize he's a total fascist. He is the most dangerous person to this country,"" according to a new book by journalist Bob Woodward.
""He's saying that Donald Trump espouses fascist policies,"" Berman said. ""It's a political ideology. Fascism is a political ideology.""

foxnews,Nathan Wade grilled by House investigators probing Georgia Trump prosecution,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nathan-wade-grilled-house-investigators-probing-georgia-trump-prosecution,"Former Fulton County special prosecutor Nathan Wade is on Capitol Hill for a closed-door deposition by the House Judiciary Committee.
Former Fulton County Special Prosecutor Nathan Wade left Capitol Hill on Tuesday after a marathon four-and-a-half hour grilling by House Judiciary Committee investigators.
Wade, whose legal team included former Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes, said little to reporters before, after and during his closed-door deposition. No lawmakers were seen entering or leaving the room.
""This is all I’m going to say – we gave our testimony, we cooperated and we are through,"" Barnes told reporters after the session.

Barnes said ""yes"" when asked if it was an effective meeting and ""no"" when asked by Fox News Digital if he expected to follow up with the committee.
Earlier, he had testy words for a reporter who asked whether Wade would plead the Fifth Amendment, responding tersely, ""What crime has been committed here?""
The House Judiciary Committee has been seeking information on Wade’s relationship with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who is investigating former President Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn his 2020 electionloss in Georgia. Trump and 18 allies were indicted by a grand jury in August 2023 on charges including racketeering and conspiracy.
Wade was brought into that investigation by Willis as a special prosecutor, but stepped away after it was revealed he and Willis began a romantic relationship, which has since ended.

In a pair of letters published by the Republican majority on the committee on Monday night,Willis saidWade was instructed ""not to answer any questions about his role in the election interference case or about any evidence in that case.""
""The disclosure of such evidence may also interfere with ongoing proceedings, this is considered legally privileged and not subject to disclosure,"" Willis wrote.
The committee responded on X, saying, ""What is she trying to hide?""

One of Trump’s co-defendants had sued to have Willis and Wade disqualified from the case, arguing their relationship presented a conflict of interest and that they financially benefited from the probe – which they have denied.
A Fulton County judge ruled in March that Willis could stay on the case if Wade was removed.

Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., shares new details about an Afghanistan national allegedly tied to an Election Day terror plot and discusses his swing state tour.
Lawmakers are raising new concerns about potential terror threats after the arrest of an Afghan national accused of planningan Election Dayattack. On""Fox & Friends""Tuesday, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., raised concerns about the vetting process for foreign nationals, warning ""thousands"" of individuals were ""rushed"" over in the wake of the Biden-Harris administration's botched Afghanistan withdrawal.
AFGHAN CHARGED WITH ELECTION DAY TERROR PLOT RAISES QUESTIONS, FEARS FROM LAWMAKERS: ‘THIS IS REAL’
SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN:I was briefed a few weeks prior to this, not by the FBI, but from a different agency. What we understood is this individual was vulnerable to touch points, meaning that they were accepted in on an SIV, special immigration visa, but there's confusion if he was prior or after the withdrawal. We believe that he was rushed with an SIV after the disastrouswithdrawal from Afghanistan,and it wasn't proper vetting to actually say he was an SIV. The issue that we have here is there's thousands of individuals that [were] rushed over here because of the Harris-Biden withdrawal, and they weren't properly vetted. And when you don't probably vet them, you don't know what their touch points – touch points mean their vulnerabilities –  vulnerabilities mean what can be leveraged against the individual to make them turn on their host country like this individual did. Fortunately, the FBI was doing their job. They did it correctly that no one was actually at harm, but they caught the individual.How many individuals are out therethat we're not paying attention to?

Authorities announced last week the arrest ofNasir Ahmad Tawhedi, an Afghan nationalwho came to the U.S. in 2021 after the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Tawhedi is charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS and receiving a firearm to be used to commit a felony or a federal crime of terrorism.
Authorities say he liquidated his family's assets to finance his plan, including purchasing rifles and one-way tickets for his wife and child back to Afghanistan.
""This defendant, motivated by ISIS, allegedly conspired to commit a violent attack, on Election Day, here on our homeland,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray in a statement.

Court filings initially stated that he came on a special immigrant visa but have since clarified that he came to the U.S. via humanitarian parole and later applied for SIV status.
A senior administration officialtold Fox News last week that Tawhedi was screened three times. He was screened first to work security for the CIA in Afghanistan, then for humanitarian parole to enter the U.S. in 2021, when he was vetted and screened in a third country, and then for special immigrant status, for which he was approved. His status has not yet been finalized. Officials believe he was radicalized after coming to the U.S.

More than 230 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals are calling on former President Trump to release his medical records afterVice President Kamala Harrisdid so.
In anopen letterdated Oct. 13, first reported by CBS News, the health care providers raise concerns about Trump's advanced age and argue that the 78-year-old Republican nominee should be transparent about his health and medical history.
""On August 20, Donald Trump said he would ‘very gladly’ release his medical records. In the 55 days since, he has yet to do so,"" the letter states. ""With no recent disclosure of health information from Donald Trump, we are left to extrapolate from public appearances. And on that front, Trump is falling concerningly short of any standard of fitness for office and displaying alarming characteristics of declining acuity.""
Most of the signatories support Harris for president. The letter asserts that Trump appears to ""ramble, meander, and crudely lash out at his many perceived grievances"" during his campaign events and questions whether this behavior is the result of cognitive changes associated with old age.
HARRIS GOADS TRUMP TO RELEASE MEDICAL RECORDS AFTER SHE GETS CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH FROM PERSONAL PHYSICIAN

""The American people deserve to have confidence in their elected officials' mental and physical capacity to do the jobs that they've elected them to do. Trump ought to be going above and beyond to provide transparency on his physical health and mental acuity, given his advancing age.""
The letter comes while Harris is goading Trump into releasing his health information after the White House put out a ""Healthcare Statement"" on Saturday that declared her to be in ""excellent health.""

Thestatement from Harris' doctoralso indicated she had her most recent annual physical exam in April of this year. Trump released his own health records while campaigning in 2016, and once he took over the White House he continued the trend. In August, with the 2024 election quickly approaching, Trump told CBS News that he would release updated medical records to the public. However, he has yet to do so, with roughly three weeks until Election Day.
""He won't put out his medical records,"" Harris said Monday morning during an interview with podcast host Roland Martin. She also slammed Trump for refusing to debate a second time and questioned why Trump's ""staff"" would not allow him to do an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" particularly when it is tradition for both presidential candidates to do a sit down with the show.

""It may be because they think he's just not ready and unfit and unstable and should not have that level of transparency for the American people,"" Harris suggested.
The Trump campaign responded by pointing out several times the former president has voluntarily released updates about his health. They also noted that he sharedrecords from a July screeningconducted by Dr. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician turned GOP congressman, following the second assassination attempt on his life.
""All have concluded [Trump] is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,"" said Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung. ""He has maintained an extremely busy and active campaign schedule unlike any other in political history."" Meanwhile, Cheung slammed Harris as being ""unable to keep up with demands of campaigning,"" arguing that compared to Trump her schedule ""is much lighter because, it is said, she does not have the stamina of President Trump.""

foxnews,Local officials face off against Georgia's elections board over rule that could shake up November,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/local-officials-face-off-against-georgias-elections-board-over-rule-could-shake-up-november,"Fox News Digital spoke with Cobb County Democratic Party Chairwoman Essence Johnson about the 2024 election and the fight to keep Georgia blue.
A hearing was held Tuesday in akey Georgia county’slawsuit against the State Elections Board (SEB), roughly three weeks until voters head to the polls on Nov. 5.
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney is overseeing the case filed by the Cobb County Board of Elections earlier this month. The bipartisan board is taking issue with a set of new rules imposed by the SEB, including a measure to require county election workers tohand count ballotsafter polls close to ensure accurate machine tabulation.
The rule has also sparked a lawsuit filed by Georgia Democratic officials, which is set for a hearing on Wednesday.
Cobb County is a majority suburban area anchored by the city of Marietta, a suburb of Atlanta.

During the Tuesday hearing, attorneys for the SEB argued that there were no limitations on when election rules can be passed and pointed out that the specific hand-counting rule applies only to the ballots themselves, not tallying individual votes cast on the ballots.
""All we are doing is saying, you need to [have] receipts of votes cast, mirror the number that the machine says were cast,"" the lawyer said.
But McBurney noted that it was ""late in the game"" for the SEB to change election rules but also conceded that, in a vacuum, wanting to ensure that the number of ballots cast matched the machine-count was a ""laudable goal.""

""Why wouldn’t we just pause, especially on the hand-count rule, given what looks like a fairly robust record of chaos that it is sowing?"" the judge asked the defendants’ lawyer.
""I'm asking you from a practical perspective, if the goal is orderly, reliable elections, why the prudent — in terms of reasonableness approach — wouldn't be to say, 'Let's try this next election,' when all those questions can be answered with no one having to sue?""

Republican Party officials have held the rule up as a critical guardrail to ensuring voters can be confident in their elections, but Democrats contend that its goal is to foment doubt in the process.
The Cobb County lawsuit argued the rules put elections boards across the state in ""an untenable position.""
An attorney in support of the plaintiffs later pointed out the state officials who have come out in opposition to the rules changes, including Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.
""All of them are concerned about the impact of this rule,"" the lawyer said.
TRUMP VS HARRIS ROUND 2? VOTERS IN KEY GA COUNTY REVEAL IF THEY WANT SECOND DEBATE
""It would be one thing in an ideal sterile environment to have people who are fresh and energized sit down and count ballots… That's not how this is going to play out. In reality, as our petitioner affidavits reference, poll workers get to their polls as early as 5 a.m., 5:30, 6 a.m. They stay as late as 8 p.m., 10 p.m. And so we're talking about adding something on top of an already 14- to 16-hour day when people are exhausted.""
McBurney pointed out that it could then be done the next day, to which the attorney responded, ""But then there are challenges that come with that as well, Your Honor.""
The judge said the hand-counting ballots rule ""does not directly interfere with the certification work going on"" but that it ""will be a resource drain, no question.""
But the SEB attorney later criticized the plaintiffs’ arguments as conjecture.
""All that it says over and over again is, quote, ‘I am concerned about the rule’s last minute adoption….I am concerned that the Cobb County Elections Office lacks space. I am concerned that the hand-count rule may lead to delays,"" he said.

""It is hypothetical on top of conjecture, on top of speculation. There is no imminent threat here. There is a threat of potential things that might happen if the worst-case scenario comes up, and that's simply not sufficient for declaratory judgment.""
McBurney heard the case the same day as he issued a decision in a separate Georgia elections case, ruling that county elections supervisors are not allowed to delay certification of results on the grounds of their own suspicions of fraud or mistakes.

foxnews,'Ruining our car industry': Biden-Harris EV regs prove flashpoint in Michigan Senate debate,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ruining-our-car-industry-biden-harris-ev-regs-prove-flashpoint-michigan-senate-debate,"Mike Rogers emphasized the importance of his latest endorsement in the Michigan Senate race, as farmers back the Republican over his Democrat foe.
Former Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., and Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., traded blows on electric vehicle mandates and border security during their Senate debate in the criticalswing state of Michigan.
""It's ruining our car industry,"" Rogers said of mandates related to buying and producing electric vehicles (EV) during Monday’s debate, starting one of the most heated exchanges of the event. ""You're promoting Chinese technology in America.""
The two candidates in Michigan’s critical Senate race have sparred over the issue of EV mandates throughout the campaign, highlighting how critical the issue is in a state that will play a major role in deciding thepresidential electionand control of the federal legislature.
Rogers has attempted through two debates in the race to tie President Biden and the Democratic Party’s support for EVs to Slotkin, who has countered that her support for the technology will ensure that Michigan remains competitive in the future of auto manufacturing.

Rogers said Democrats such as Slotkin are ""killing the car business"" when it comes to promoting EVs, accusing his opponent of voting for a ""mandate"" on EVs ""at least three times.""
While there has been no mandate that Americans must purchase EVs, the Biden administration has pressed emissions standards that could force automakers to ensure that up to two-thirds of their new vehicles sold are zero-emissions by 2032. According to a report in the Detroit Free Press, Slotkin voted against legislation that would have blocked the new standards, but has expressed openness to rewriting them if they would hurt U.S. automakers.
""I want that manufacturing here. I don't care what you drive, I want to build them,"" Slotkin said during Monday’s debate.
The two candidates also attempted to cast blame on the other for the situation at thesouthern border, with Slotkin accusing Rogers and Republicans of a campaign to kill Biden’s border legislation before it could get through Congress.
""What's going on at the southern border is a symptom of a broken immigration system,"" Slotkin said, accusing Republicans of using the ""border as a political issue than actually do the real work and get things done.""

Rogers instead blamed Democrats on the issue, calling Biden’s legislation a ""terrible bill"" that would have allowed for continued legal crossings, while Slotkin questioned how Rogers could claim to know better on the issue than the national Border Patrol union, which threw its support behind the deal.
The debate also highlighted the two candidates' competing viewson abortion, with Slotkin doubling down on campaign ads that have accused Rogers of supporting several pieces of anti-abortion legislation.
""He has shown us who he is, don’t trust him on this issue,"" Slotkin said.

Rogers countered by arguing that he supported leaving the question of abortion to the voters in each state, promising not to do anything in the Senate that would undo the will of voters in Michigan who voted to make abortion a right in the state.
""I won't do anything when I go back to the United States Senate to undo the vote of the people,"" Rogers said.
Another tense exchange saw the two candidates trade blows over gun reform, with Slotkin acknowledging her ownhistory with firearmsbut calling for tougher legislation to ""go after the number one killer of children in our communities.""

""It's really, really easy to understand why politicians, in the face of murdered children, don't do anything. They don't do it because they receive campaign donations and they're scared,"" Slotkin said. ""They're scared because they don't want to lose their election, and it's terrible.""
THE BIDEN-HARRIS EV MANDATES WILL HURT WORKERS IN STATES LIKE MICHIGAN: TUDOR DIXON
Rogers countered that the issue mostly centered on the country’s struggles with mental health, and that ""banning guns isn’t going"" to solve the issue.
Inflation andthe economywere another major issue during the debate, with Rogers appealing to voters to remember if they were better off under the leadership of Republicans four years ago.
""Are you better off than you were four years ago?"" Rogers asked. ""My opponent voted 100% with Biden-Harris (Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic presidential nominee) on all of the things that have raised your prices.""
Slotkin responded by pointing to her support for bringing supply chains back to the U.S., which she argued would help bring prices down. She also hit Rogers on his lack of support for allowing the government to negotiate lower pharmaceutical prices, something she said would help alleviate the pressure on middle-class families.

The Senate race in Michigan will be one of the closely watched nationally and features one of the few tight races that could determine control of the upper chamber this election.
According to theFox News Power Rankings, the Michigan Senate race leans in the Democrats' favor. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average, Slotkin currently holds a slim 1.9 lead over her Republican opponent.
Even so, the race has shifted significantly since Sept. 19, when Slotkin held a 5.1 advantage over Rogers in the average.

FIRST ON FOX:A dramatic, months-longcampaign seasonis drawing to a close as the clock ticks closer to Election Day, according to a new message from House Republicans to voters.
The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), the House GOP’s campaign arm, released a new digital ad on Tuesday marking 21 days until the election.
It comes as Republican Party operators at the state, federal and local level work overtime to convince supporters to vote early, particularly in pivotal swing states like Georgia and North Carolina that have been ravaged by Helene this storm season.

Trump’s voice opens the video with, ""Republicans must win, and we must use every appropriate tool available to beat the Democrats. They are destroying our country.""
""I don’t care when you vote, but you’ve got to vote,"" Trump says in the video.
Meanwhile, clips of vulnerable Republicans, like Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., and Ken Calvert, R-Calif., flash across the screen interspersed with the word ""vote.""

""In 21 days, Americans will cast their ballots to end Democrats’ dangerous, far-left socialist agenda for our country. Every trip to the grocery store, fentanyl death or crime committed in a family’s neighborhood should give voters another reason to record their vote in this critical election,"" NRCC rapid response director Macy Gardner told Fox News Digital.
Early in-person voting is kicking off in four states this week. Georgia can head to the polls before Election Day from Tuesday through Nov. 1, while North Carolina begins early voting on Thursday. Voters in Iowa and Kansas are also heading to the polls.
Republican Party officials have been working overtime to convince their base to vote earlyafter Democratswalloped the GOP with non-Election Day voters in 2020.

foxnews,More than 230 doctors and health care professionals call on Trump to release medical records,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/more-than-230-doctors-health-care-professionals-call-trump-release-medical-records,"Trump 2024 senior adviser Tim Murtaugh reacts to Vice President Kamala Harris calling on former President Trump to release his medical records on 'The Story.'
More than 230 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals are calling on former President Trump to release his medical records afterVice President Kamala Harrisdid so.
In anopen letterdated Oct. 13, first reported by CBS News, the health care providers raise concerns about Trump's advanced age and argue that the 78-year-old Republican nominee should be transparent about his health and medical history.
""On August 20, Donald Trump said he would ‘very gladly’ release his medical records. In the 55 days since, he has yet to do so,"" the letter states. ""With no recent disclosure of health information from Donald Trump, we are left to extrapolate from public appearances. And on that front, Trump is falling concerningly short of any standard of fitness for office and displaying alarming characteristics of declining acuity.""
Most of the signatories support Harris for president. The letter asserts that Trump appears to ""ramble, meander, and crudely lash out at his many perceived grievances"" during his campaign events and questions whether this behavior is the result of cognitive changes associated with old age.

""The American people deserve to have confidence in their elected officials' mental and physical capacity to do the jobs that they've elected them to do. Trump ought to be going above and beyond to provide transparency on his physical health and mental acuity, given his advancing age.""
The letter comes while Harris is goading Trump into releasing his health information after the White House put out a ""Healthcare Statement"" on Saturday that declared her to be in ""excellent health.""

Thestatement from Harris' doctoralso indicated she had her most recent annual physical exam in April of this year. Trump released his own health records while campaigning in 2016, and once he took over the White House he continued the trend. In August, with the 2024 election quickly approaching, Trump told CBS News that he would release updated medical records to the public. However, he has yet to do so, with roughly three weeks until Election Day.
""He won't put out his medical records,"" Harris said Monday morning during an interview with podcast host Roland Martin. She also slammed Trump for refusing to debate a second time and questioned why Trump's ""staff"" would not allow him to do an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" particularly when it is tradition for both presidential candidates to do a sit down with the show.

""It may be because they think he's just not ready and unfit and unstable and should not have that level of transparency for the American people,"" Harris suggested.
The Trump campaign responded by pointing out several times the former president has voluntarily released updates about his health. They also noted that he sharedrecords from a July screeningconducted by Dr. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician turned GOP congressman, following the second assassination attempt on his life.
""All have concluded [Trump] is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,"" said Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung. ""He has maintained an extremely busy and active campaign schedule unlike any other in political history."" Meanwhile, Cheung slammed Harris as being ""unable to keep up with demands of campaigning,"" arguing that compared to Trump her schedule ""is much lighter because, it is said, she does not have the stamina of President Trump.""

foxnews,From cease-fire push to boots on the ground in Israel: US seemingly accepts involvement in escalating war,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/what-does-putting-us-troops-ground-mean-us-involvement-israeli-response-iran,"Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on the U.S. deploying a missile defense system to Israel on ‘Your World.’
The U.S. is now more deeply entrenched in the conflict in the Middle East after a pivotal move to send troopsto Israelwas announced this week.
On Monday, the Biden administration revealed it would offer Israel one of theU.S.’s highly sophisticated THAAD missile defense systems– as Israel braces for potential Iranian retaliation to the counter-attack it is planning after Tehran rained down missiles on Tel Aviv on Oct. 1.
Only U.S. troops can operate the system, and 100 of them will deploy to Israel. The Pentagon only has seven operable Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries in its possession, and the one offered to Israel would presumably be among the seven.
Though Washington has armed Israel throughout its existence, putting boots on the ground for Israel's defense is a rare departure from U.S. policy and the first U.S. deployment there since the outbreak of war after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.
""It's a bit unprecedented,"" said EJ Kimpton, policy director at the U.S. Israel Education Association.
""Israel's mantra has been, you know, with ‘Never Again,’ meaning we will defend ourselves by ourselves, obviously working with allies, but that we should be able to defend our country and not be dependent upon others,"" Kimpton went on. ""It changes the dynamic between the U.S. and Israel in Israel's war fighting over the years.""

""This would be the first time that U.S. personnel would be actively engaged in essentially fighting a war with Israelif Iranwere to carry out additional strikes.""
NETANYAHU HITS BIDEN ADMIN, SAYS ISRAEL – NOT US – WILL DECIDE HOW TO HANDLE IRAN
From pushing Israel to a cease-fire, the U.S. has pivoted to containing the war in the Middle East, to seemingly accepting the fate of U.S. involvement in the conflict.
The U.S. has some 43,000 troops deployed elsewhere in the Middle East and recently sent a ""few thousand"" to the region within the last few weeks to be ready to defend Israel if necessary.
""It's inescapable to see it as anything else [than escalation], the United States is now actually sending troops. We did not do that in Ukraine,"" Trita Parsi, vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, told Fox News Digital.
Sending U.S. troopsto Ukraineis a non-starter in American discourse – a popular refrain among supporters is that such aid will prevent U.S. troops from ever having to put themselves in Russia's line of fire.
""We may end up having American casualties, and to put soldiers in that type of vulnerable situation for something that is not the defense of the United States itself, I think, is a very serious step taken by the administration,"" said Parsi.
In the past, Iranians have targeted military installations, including Israeli air defense systems. The THAAD system is expected to be able to intercept ballistic missiles launched from Iran and Yemen and shoot down any short-range missiles launched by Hezbollah from Lebanon.
Others question why the administration is supplying the system with no real off-ramp to the conflict or U.S. involvement in it. Israel’s mission to eradicate Hezbollah and Hamas has now drawn it into direct conflict with Iran, and hope for peace anytime soon appears to have faded.
""Why are we keeping U.S. troops in harm’s way in Iraq and Syria with no clear mission or defensive strategy, while deploying critical defense systems like THAAD to Israel?"" Jason Beardsley, senior coalitions adviser to Concerned Veterans for America, questioned.

""The reality is, we’re funding both sides of this conflict – directly aiding Iraq, whose Iranian-backed militias target our forces, and indirectly supporting Israel’s defense without addressing the real vulnerability: U.S. personnel scattered across the Middle East, with Iran’s proxies actively targeting our troops.""
IDF MEETS LITTLE RESISTANCE FROM HEZBOLLAH AFTER WEEKS OF HITTING TERROR TARGETS, OFFICIALS SAY
The U.S. has some 2,500 troops in Iraq leading a coalition that provides extensive support to the Iraqi Security Forces to fight ISIS. But Iran has already tightened its grip on Baghdad and the mission its forces carry out.
The THAAD will assist Israel’s other missile defenses in what could be the Biden administration bracing for escalation: an aggressive counter-attack from Iran to an aggressive counter-attack from Israel.
For two weeks, the world has waited to see how Israel responds to the 200 missiles Iran fired at the heart of Tel Aviv.
A violent showing from Israel might deter Iran from wanting to pick a larger battle. But in the Biden administration’s view, a disproportionate response risks a tit-for-tat that could lead to all-out war.
President Biden may have offered the system as a way to coax Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to follow his recommendation: to make sure Israel's counterstrike to Iran’s missile attacks is ""proportional"" – by going after military installations – not nuclear or oil facilities.

""I think the administration may be thinking that by offering this, they can convince the Israelis not to go that far,"" said Parsi.
""If you truly want to put an end to this, then sending the same system that actually makes it easier for Israel to escalate is not the answer…  Sometimes, it's really difficult to discern who is actually making the policy and what is the policy.""
Netanyahu told Biden he was willing to strike military facilities when they spoke on the phone last week, according to aWashington Post report.But after that report, Netanyahu said in a statement he would not be making any decisions based on Biden's insistence on proportionality.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin sent a letter to Israel demanding it improve thehumanitarian situation in Gazaor risk losing crucial security assistance.
The letter was supposed to be a private, diplomatic communication and was not intended for the public, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said at a press conference Tuesday.
""What we have seen over the past few months is that the level ofhumanitarian assistancehas not been sustained,"" adding, ""Ultimately, we did not see our concerns sufficiently addressed, which is why the two secretaries sent the letter they did,"" Miller warned.

National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby tried to assuage fears and told reporters that the letter was not meant as a threat. ""The letter was simply meant to reiterate the sense of urgency we feel and the seriousness with which we feel about the need for an increase, dramatic increase in humanitarian assistance. And that's what you can do with your friend. That's what you can do with your ally. And it's not the first time we've communicated that to Israel. But hopefully we won't have to communicate it again.""
Some critics took issue with the letter not being a threat.

""I’m not sure which is worse to consider, that threatening an ally is a necessary pre-election political theater to pacify radical pro-Hamas leftists or that it’s actually U.S. policy to cut off arms to Israel if Israel doesn’t agree to feed, fuel and fund Hamas,"" Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and former NSC official in the Trump administration, told Fox News Digital.
""Because let’s be clear, that’s what this is really all about – whether Hamas survives by controlling humanitarian aid and its distribution,"" Goldberg said.
The letter, which wasfirst obtained by Axios, expressed its ""deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza"" and is particularly concerned that recent actions by the Israeli government, including halting commercial imports and denying or impeding nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September, are ""contributing to an accelerated deterioration in the conditions in Gaza.""

The letter says Israel has within 30 days to ""reverse the downward humanitarian trajectory"" and remain consistent with its obligations to the U.S. Failure to comply with these demands, the letter said, would violate existing U.S. law and have serious implications for U.S. national security policy.
Israel has defended its humanitarian response to the crisis in Gaza in a statement released on Monday by COGAT, the army division that deals with aid to Gaza, stating, ""Since the start of the war, Israel has allowed the international community to bring 54,270 aid trucks into Gaza, carrying 1,064,820 tons of humanitarian aid through various crossings, including 38,746 trucks carrying approximately 824,078 tons of food.""

The U.S. must continually assess the delivery of humanitarian aid under the Foreign Assistance Act in order to provide foreign military financing assistance to Israel. President Biden issued a memorandum in February stating countries receivingU.S. weaponsmust adhere to international humanitarian law and provide written assurances of their compliance under the laws of war.
The U.S. has surged billions of dollars in security aid to Israel since the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel is also the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid since its founding and has received around $310 billion in economic and military aid. On average, the U.S. provides Israel with over $3 billion in security assistance a year.

A major component of security aid includes $500 million a year for joint U.S.-Israeli missile defense programs, notably the Iron Dome, David’s Sling and Arrow II, which have been critical to thwarting rocket and missile attacks from Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran since Oct. 7.
Some of the military aid to Israel since Oct. 7 includes 13,981 120mm M830A1 high-explosive anti-tank multi-purpose with tracer (MPAT) tank cartridges, 500 aircraft deliveries and 107 sea shipments to Israel of over 50,000 tons of munitions and weapons systems, according to the Congressional Research Service.

(Credit: Government Press Office Israel)
Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahuon Tuesday took umbrage at remarks made by French President Emmanuel Macron, in which he stated that Israel was created by the United Nations.
Macron was speaking to his cabinet when he said, ""Mr Netanyahu must not forget that his country was created by a decision of the U.N.,"" referring to the resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1947 to partition Britain's Palestinian mandate into separate Jewish and Arab states.
""Therefore, this is not the time to disregard the decisions of the U.N.,"" he added.

Israel accepted the partition plan while the Palestinians rejected it. Hours after declaring its independence on May 14, 1948, armies from the surrounding Arab countries attacked Israel, which won the war a year later.
""A reminder to the French President: It was not a UN decision that established the State of Israel but the victory that was achieved in theWar of Independencewith the blood of our heroic fighters, many of whom were Holocaust survivors, including from the Vichy regime in France,"" Netanyahu read from a statement in response to Macron's comment.
Macron's remarks came as he called for an end to arms exports to the Gaza Strip and Lebanon in an effort to create conditions for a cease-fire.
The call for an arms embargo comes amid Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza following the terror group's unprovoked attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and its military operations in Lebanon, following a year of rocket fire from Hezbollah, which is backedby Iran.
Earlier this month, Netanyahu criticized Macron and other Western leaders for calls to stop the flow of arms.

""As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilized countries should be standing firmly by Israel’s side, yet President Macron and other western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them,""Netanyahu saidin a statement.
He continued, ""Is Iran imposing an arms embargoon Hezbollah, on the Houthis, on Hamas and on its other proxies? Of course not. This axis of terror stands together, but countries who supposedly oppose this terror axis call for an arms embargo on Israel.""
He called their stance a ""disgrace,"" saying that Israel would win ""with or without their support, but their shame will continue long after the war is won.""
On Oct. 6, Macron said France would no longer supply arms to Israel, although it would continue to send missile defense equipment.

""When you hear those numbers, and you're seeing in the polls — Black men aren't as excited or fired up for you, how do you respond to that?"" host Justin Carter asked Harris.

""Black men are no different from anybody else. They expect that you have to earn their vote. And that's why I'm out here,"" she continued.
""It's incumbent on me to earn their support, that’s why I’m talking to folks about the work I’ve done in my career,"" she said, citing her efforts to help strengthen small businesses and pledging to continue to do so if elected as president.
According to aNew York Times/Siena College pollreleased on Saturday, Harris currently holds 78% of the Black vote, which is down from 2020, when President Biden won approximately 90% of that voting bloc. It's also down from 2016, when Hillary Clinton won approximately 92% of the Black vote. Harris' support among Black men has dropped even more significantly, according to the report: 70% said they would vote for Harris in November, down from Biden’s 85% in 2020.
""She continues to think that she can entertain her way to the Black vote,"" Sewell said. ""We're offended, and we want her to be willing to actually bring real solutions to the complex problems that we're facing in urban America.""
Meanwhile, Harris rolled out her ""Opportunity Agenda for Black Men"" this week, which includes providing 1 million loans that are fully forgivable to Black entrepreneurs and others to start a business, championing education, training and mentorship programs that help Black men get good-paying jobs in high-demand industries and lead their communities, including pathways to become teachers.

Charlamagne Tha God revealed on Friday that an anonymous source told him that former President Trump's appearance on a recent podcast was going to get him elected.
A key component of Trump’s media strategy this election has been doing interviews on podcasts to appeal to young male voters. One appearance that made numerous headlines wasTrump’s interview on the ""Flagrant"" podcast,hosted by comedian Andrew Schulz, last week.
""Breakfast Club"" radio show co-host Charlamagne spoke candidly with Schulz afterward on their shared ""Brilliant Idiots"" podcast, saying he heard one response so significant he had to keep the person’s name secret.
""A young, Black man, 20-something years old, I’m not gonna say his name. I should say his name… He comes to me this morning, he turns to me, he goes, ‘Flagrant is gonna get Trump elected,’"" Charlamagne said.

Schulz burst out laughing, ""The interview was fire, bro, I don’t know what to tell you.""
Charlamagne and Schulz went on to discuss how Trump’s off-the-cuff humor is a stark contrast with Vice President Kamala Harris, who Schulz argued is afraid of losing the advantage she believes she has.
""There’s nothing about the poll numbers that we’re seeing right now that should make anybody feel like she’s got this,"" Charlamagne said, and when acomparison was made to Hillary in 2016he replied, ""I keep telling people this campaign feels more Hillary-ish than it does Obama-ish- than Obama ’08-ish.""
During the interview on ""Flagrant,"" Trump had the hosts in stitches numerous times with his irreverent humor, such as when he joked that Biden has one advantage over him.
""He has one ability that I don't have — he sleeps,"" Trump said. ""He can sleep! This guy goes on a beach, and he lays down on one of those 6-ounce [chairs]. They weigh 6 ounces, and he can’t lift it. They're meant for children, young people, and old people to lift. They’re aluminum, you know, hollow aluminum, they weigh very little, and he can't lift.""
He later went on to joke, ""Somebody convinced him helooks good in a bathing suit,and when you’re 82, typically bathing suits aren’t gonna make you look great.""

On The Breakfast Club, Charlamagne recently critiqued the Harris-Walz campaign’s messaging tactics, arguing that their commentary about global politics seems ""very out of touch to what’s going on right here in America.""
This, he said, is a stark difference from Trump and his running-mate JD Vance, who are ""talking about what’s happening here at home and saying things like‘America First’and ‘Make America Great Again,’ that messaging sometimes resonates a lot more.""
He then corrected himself and said, ""Not sometimes, it does resonate a lot more.""

As Election Day approaches, scammers are finding new ways to deceive voters. Several media reports are highlighting a new scam where people receive a text message falsely claiming they are not yet registered to vote. Election officials are warning Americans to be cautious of these scam messages, as more are expected to circulate in the weeks leading up to the general election.

The local Channel 4 affiliate WDIV in Detroit warned about a new text message wave in late August that could prevent registered voters from casting their ballot. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported a similar incident around the same time, warning Pennsylvanians to be wary of potential scam text messages targeting voters.
A spokesperson for the Department of State said voters should expect more of these messages to be sent in the weeks leading up to the general election.
""Voters should be aware that opportunistic bad actors may attempt to use this campaign season to send phishing or smishing emails/texts,"" Matt Heckel, a spokesperson for the department, told the Philadelphia Inquirer.
Both these reports and several others refer to a text message that is linked to the site all-vote.com: ""We have you in our records as not registered to vote. Check your registration status and register in 2 minutes.""
A woman voting(Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
DON’T FALL PREY TO THIS ELECTION SEASON’S CRAFTIEST SCAMS
For one, the domain all-vote.com isn’t associated with the government. Another clue is that even people who were already registered to vote in their state received this message. WDIV even interviewed a seventh-grader from Canada who said he also got the text, despite not being eligible to vote.
A quick search on Who.Is lookup shows the domain was registered on July 10, 2024, definitely a red flag.KrebsOnSecuritymentioned that some of these texts are also linking to another domain, votewin.org, which asks for your name, address, email, date of birth and phone number when you visit.
They even pre-check boxes to sign you up for more notifications. The government doesn’t need all that info from you. To register to vote or to update your voter registration, all you need to do is visitvote.govand select your state or region.

FAKE SOFTWARE FIXES FUEL MONEY-STEALING MALWARE THREAT
1) Unsolicited contact: If you receive a message from an unknown number or an unexpected source, especially one claiming urgency (like registering to vote), it could be a scam.
2) Suspicious links: Scammers often use fake links that appear legitimate but redirect you to phishing websites. Always hover over links or check the domain carefully. In the case of ""all-vote.com,"" if it's not a well-known or official site (like .gov for U.S. voting), it's worth being suspicious.
3) Grammatical errors: Many scam messages contain typos, awkward phrasing or grammatical mistakes. This can be a red flag for phishing or scam attempts.
4) Requests for personal information: Legitimate organizations typically don’t ask for sensitive information like Social Security numbers, bank details or passwords via text. Scams often do.
5) Have strong antivirus software:The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious texts, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.
HOW TO STOP ANNOYING ROBOCALLS
As Election Day gets closer, it’s essential to stay alert to scams like these. If you receive a suspicious text about your voter registration, remember to check the details carefully. Look out for unofficial domains like all-vote.com or votewin.org, which have nothing to do with the government. Always head to trusted sites like vote.gov to confirm your status. Scammers are getting creative, but knowing the signs can help you avoid getting caught up in their traps.

foxnews,"Harris' off-putting manner put Zelenskyy on defensive ahead of Russian invasion, new book reveals",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-off-putting-manner-put-zelenskyy-defensive-ahead-russian-invasion-new-book-reveals,"Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker discusses growing threats from Russia and China on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.’
Vice President Kamala Harris’history as a federal prosecutor instilled in her a direct, sometimes adversarial communication style that reportedly alienated Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during their first private sit-down, leaving him ""disgruntled"" and defensive just days before Russian troops invaded his country.
Their tense sit-down was chronicled in ""War,"" the new book by Bob Woodward. In the book, Woodward details some of the most consequential foreign policy and security challengesoverseen by President Biden during his first term. Among them, Russia’s 2022 invasion and ongoing war in Ukraine.
Fox News obtained an early copy of the book, which is available in bookstores today.
As Woodward reports, Biden deployed Harris to the Munich Security Conference in February 2022, less than a week before Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops commenced their full-scale invasion of Ukraine – with the sole mission of convincing Zelenskyy that theRussian incursionwas imminent, based on all available U.S. intelligence and the hundreds of thousands of troops it had confirmed Russia had been amassing nearby, including some 40,000 soldiers near the Belarusian border.
Harris was to demonstrate unified support for Ukraine from the U.S. and NATO, and to help Zelenskyy accept the fact that this was, indeed, happening.
However, Woodward reports, aspects of that mission backfired – at least behind closed doors.
Publicly, Harris delivered a winning speech, effectively reassuring the world of the U.S. commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and Article 5. It is considered among her major achievements as vice president.
HUNTER BIDEN LEGAL SAGA IS ‘REAL WAR’ THAT 'PREOCCUPIED' OUTGOING PRESIDENT, NEW WOODWARD BOOK CLAIMS

In private, however, Zelenskyy was immediately put off by Harris’s brusque communication style and ""forceful"" demeanor during their sit-down, during which Harris and her national security adviser, Philip Gordon, wore masks and did not attempt to shake hands with their Ukrainian counterparts upon entering the room.
Though Germany was still under COVID-19 protocols, the icy start to the meeting ""disgruntled"" Zelenskyy, Woodward said, and left the Ukrainian president feeling ""like he was about to be reprimanded"" at a frightening and vulnerable time for his nation.
""You need to take seriously the likelihood that any day the Russians will invade your country,"" Harris told him forcefully.
In Woodward's telling, things between the two did not improve from there.
Harris, a successful former federal prosecutor and California attorney general, has been praised and criticized for her adversarial communication style – and it was one she reportedly employed during her sit-down with Zelenskyy, in attempt to convince him of the imminence of Russia's invasion.
TRUMP MEETS UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY AT TRUMP TOWER, SAYS RUSSIA'S WAR MUST END WITH 'FAIR DEAL'
Vice President Kamala Harris speaks to reporters at her hotel after the Munich Security Conference.(Andrew Harnik/Pool via Reuters)
""Look,"" Harris told him, after some tense back-and-forth, ""our teams will share more specific information with you but we are telling you that your numbers are wrong. You really face a potentially imminent invasion.""
Rather than softening him, the meeting appeared to put Ukraine's president even more on the defensive.
As Woodward writes, Zelenskyy was hard-pressed to acknowledge the imminence of the invasion despite credible U.S. intelligence, in large part because it would create a ""self-fulling prophecy"" for Ukraine's nascent democracy, risking the collapse of the country's economy, and potentially, its government.
Finally, Zelenskyy relented, looking Harris in the eye and asking directly, ""What do you want me to do?""
He inquired whether the U.S. would impose sanctions, close ports to Russian ships, give Ukraine Stinger or Javelin missiles or send warplanes to his country, in order to equip them for the battles ahead.
Harris’s answer did little to assuage him. ""The punishment can only come after the crime,"" she said of a U.S. response to Russia, Woodward noted, instead advising him to ""start thinking about things like having a succession plan in place to run the country if you're captured or killed or cannot govern.""
Zelenskyy was urged by the U.S. to have an escape plan – one which he boldly rebuffed, choosing to remain in Kyiv in the days and weeks following Russia’s invasion.
He also turned down evacuation offers from both the U.S. and Turkey following the start of the war.
The ""fight is here,"" he would later say from Kyiv. ""I need ammunition, not a ride.""

During a pre-campaign-rally stop in Pittsburgh on Thursday, former President Barack Obama appeared to admonish Black Americans who have not been as fervent in their support for Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid as they were for his in 2008 and 2012.
""We have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all corners of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running,"" Obama said during a stop at a campaign office.
""Now, I also want to say that that seems to be more pronounced with the brothers. So if you don't mind -- just for a second, I've got to speak to y’all and say that when you have a choice that is this clean: When on the one hand, you have somebody who grew up like you, went to college with you understands the struggles [and the] pain and joy that comes from those experiences…""

foxnews,"As a cautious Kamala loses momentum, Democrats are panicking over a Trump win",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cautious-kamala-loses-momentum-democrats-panicking-over-trump-win,"Fox News media analyst challenges ex-Clinton adviser Mark Penn's call for a full internal investigation into the ABC News Presidential Debate.
TheKamala Harriscampaign rocket, which soared to dazzling heights when she got into the race, is losing altitude.
Despite raising a billion dollars, despite overwhelmingly positive coverage by the mainstream media, she has failed to deliver a compelling message and is especially struggling to win over Black and Latino voters. There’s no question that many Democrats, who grew accustomed to reading stories about who’ll be in the Harris Cabinet, are panicking.
Now you could look at the glass as half-full and say it’s remarkable that a relatively unpopular vice president, in a short period of time, is running neck and neck withDonald Trump.She is tied nationally in a new NBC College poll. But that’s a drop of five points for Harris since the last survey in September.
Trump is the ultimate Teflon candidate. The press may jump on him for refusing to release his medical records (as Harris just did) but demanding she take a cognitive test; for using incendiary language against illegal immigrants, or for vowing to protect women when it’s his Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe.
NOW THAT KAMALA HARRIS IS DOING INTERVIEWS, PEOPLE ARE REMINDED THEY ‘DON’T LIKE HER’: LISA BOOTHE
The Harris campaign's hype train appears to be screeching to a grinding halt – and regardless of whether they'll admit it, Democratic intelligentsia are taking notice.(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)
It doesn’t matter. MAGA loyalists can’t stand the media, and they’re not going to change their minds at this late date. He has the advantage of having held the job. They remember Trump’s presidency with growing fondness, particularly for a strong economy and greater limits at the border, and brush aside any negative developments, especially Jan. 6.
Harris has certainly made policy proposals and done a bunch of softball interviews. But she made a big mistake on ""The View,"" saying she couldn’t think of a single thing where she’d differ fromJoe Biden.It was not intended as a gotcha question.
How can she grab the mantle of the change candidate and, with that sentence, cast herself as Biden 2.0?
KAMALA 2.0’S CHALLENGE? MAKING MORE NEWS, AND NOT JUST WITH ULTRA-FRIENDLY HOSTS
If she feels loyalty to Joe, it’s misguided. As a veteran pol, he would understand if she said he did a good job but here’s several areas where I disagree with him and would do things differently–no word salad allowed.
Axios and others are reporting tension between the Harris and Biden camps – she’s replaced the president’s top strategists and spokesmen – precisely the kind of leaks that mark a sputtering campaign.
When people complain that they don’t really know Kamala, they’re really saying they’re not yet prepared to trust her with the nuclear codes. She still has to pass the commander-in-chief test. But she also has to seem warm and approachable. That’s a daunting challenge in a country that, unlike much of the world, has never elected a female president.
Kamala Harris' last-minute media blitz would be better spent on enemy territory than on cracking beers open with Stephen Colbert.(Screenshot/CBS)
Here’s someBritish invectivefrom Andrew Sullivanon his Substack:
""The more I listened to her in these interviews, the more worried I became that she doesn’t actually believe in anything…
""Her team either fears or knows she may not be up to it. And this is bleeding obvious. A presidential campaign where you rarely face the press, never deal with a hostile interview, and never hold a presser is a campaign defined by fear. You can smell it from miles away.""
Andrew, by the way, is voting for Harris, mainly because he’ll do anything to keep Trump out of theWhite House.
Kamala keeps talking about being the underdog, but she’s run a very cautious campaign. The anxiety about making a mistake should be outweighed by the need to make news, at a time when Trump is back to dominating the news. Many days go by in which she’s a minor TV presence compared to the ratings-boosting Trump.
It’s smart that she’s now agreed to several network town halls, but she should have been doing these from the start, rather than reciting the same stump speech at rallies. Drinking beer with Stephen Colbert doesn’t quite cut it.
WHY VANCE EASILY BEAT WALZ IN DEBATE, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE IN THE PROCESS
And who would have thought that the woman of color would be lagging behind the usual Democratic margins among Blacks – particularly Black men –and Latinos?
Things reached the point where Barack Obama had to scold Black men for sexism, accusing them of not being comfortable with voting for a woman.
The battleground polls are tight, so obviously Harris can still win. But she basically needs to camp outin Pennsylvania,Michigan and Wisconsin rather than trying to pick off these Sunbelt states.
The Harris campaign, if it hopes to take things all the way, needs to remain laser-focused on campaigning in the Rust Belt – rather than the usually-competitive Sun Belt, states that former President Trump seems poised to easily run away with.(AP Photo/David Yeazell)
In fact, if she had put aside any personal friction and picked Josh Shapiro, she’d probably have more of an edge in his state. Instead, she went withTim Walz,who’s not helping the ticket much no matter how many pheasants he hunts. He has, however, done well in two straight interviews with ""Fox News Sunday.""
A major step forward: Harris agreeing yesterday to an interview with Fox anchor Bret Baier, on Wednesday in Pennsylvania. Some headlines are calling this a risky move, but Bret has vast experience with such interviews and will absolutely be fair. The upside for her: reaching the largest audience by far in cable news.
Bret said on the air that he believes there’s ""a sense that they have inside the campaign, their strategy has to change, they’ve got to change. They’re losing Black males… I think that the campaign realizes they have to do more outreach.""

foxnews,"Trump counters Harris media blitz by ripping Bob Woodward, Howard Stern and her hurricane briefing",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-counters-harris-media-blitz-ripping-bob-woodward-howard-stern-hurricane-briefing,"Panelists Kellyanne Conway, Howard Kurtz and Patrick Murphy react to Vice President Kamala Harris’ recent media interviews on ‘The Story.’
On one point, at least, the Kremlin has sided with Bob Woodwardagainst former President Donald Trump.
Woodward is coming out with a new book, and among its headline-making disclosures is his report on what happened when the pandemic struck, when the death toll was soaring and people could not get home testing kits for COVID-19.
FROM KISSY-FACE SITDOWN ON ‘THE VIEW’ TO A TOUGHER GRILLING ON ‘60 MINUTES,’ KAMALA HARRIS IS MAKING NEWS
Trump, at that point in 2020, secretly sentVladimir Putina number of Abbott Point of Care COVID test machines ""for his personal use.""
The Trump campaign said Woodward’s book, an advance copy of which was obtained by CNN, consisted entirely of made-up stories.
However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov confirmed the receipt of theCOVID machines.

""As for the tests, when the pandemic began, countries did not have enough equipment,"" Peskov said. ""And many countries then exchanged such gestures of support and sent each other shipments of various equipment they had.""
In fact, during the spring of 2020, Russia sent the Trump administration 60 tons of medical equipment.
Woodward also quotes the Russian dictator as telling Trump, ""I don’t want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me. They don’t care about me.""
KAMALA 2.0’S CHALLENGE? MAKING MORE NEWS, AND NOT JUST WITH ULTRA-FRIENDLY HOSTS
However, Peskov disputed another assertion by Woodward, that Trump has stayed in touch with Putin since he left the White House, with as many as seven calls between them. ""As for the calls, that's a lie,"" Peskov said.
In the book ""War,"" however, the Washington Post sleuth recounts a scene where Trump tells a top aide to leave the room so ""he could have what he said was a private phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin."" Trump officials now say they are not aware of any such conversations.
The former president granted Woodward 18 taped interviews for his previous book, but they had a falling out after the veteran reporter wrote that Trump was unfit for office and was sued by his subject for releasing the recordings.

I know Woodward’s work extremely well, and while any journalist can be misled by sources, he does not make things up.
Other parts of the book dealwith President Bidenconfronting Putin about the coming invasion of Ukraine, had Vice President Kamala Harris warn a skeptical Volodomyr Zelenskyy, and – with officials assuming a 50% chance that he might use a tactical nuclear weapon against the Ukrainians, called the Kremlin boss the ""epitome of evil.""
The president repeatedlycursed out Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin ""Bibi"" Netanyahu, calling him an ""SOB"" and, later, a ""f---ing liar"" after the Israeli prime minister invaded the crowded area called Rafah despite American pressure.
WHY VANCE EASILY BEAT WALZ IN DEBATE, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE IN THE PROCESS
In the statement from Trump’s spokesman, which sounds like it was dictated by the boss, Woodward is described as ""a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. Woodward is an angry, little man and is clearly upset because President Trump is successfully suing him because of the unauthorized publishing of recordings he made previously. President Trump gave him absolutely no access for this trash book that either belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section of a discount bookstore or used as toilet tissue. Woodward is a total sleazebag who has lost it mentally, and he’s slow, lethargic, incompetent and overall a boring person with no personality.""
Why stop there?
Trump, who prides himself on being a counter-puncher, wastes little time before swinging away.

After Harris’ friendly radio interview with Howard Stern, who said it would be insanity to vote for Trump, a post appeared on Truth Social.
""BETA MALE Howard Stern made a fool of himself on his low-rated radio show when he ‘interviewed’ Lyin’ Kamala Harris, and hit her with so many SOFTBALL questions that even she was embarrassed.
""He looked like a real fool, working so hard to make a totally incompetent and ill-equipped person look as good as possible, which wasn’t very good. I dropped Howard a long time ago, like most others, and have since been credited with very good judgment!""
Trump and Stern were, of course, once New York pals, and Trump attended his wedding.
Trump also had campaign manager Chris LaCivita take a swipe at Fox News for covering (along with other networks) a government briefing, featuring both Biden and Harris, on Hurricane Milton as the monster storm was heading toward Florida.
""@FoxNews ⁩just as bad as every other ‘cable news’ network …running literally propaganda and @KamalaHarris ⁩TV ads disguised as a news conference,"" Chris LaCivita posted on X.

Of course, there’s a political benefit for Harris showing that she and FEMA are working hard to prepare for the Florida storm, just as there is when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis holds a presser on the Category 5 threat.
However, with Harris' media blitz finally making some news after weeks in which Trump has dominated the campaign coverage, this reflects his determination to insert himself into every story that surfaces, no matter how negative.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.CNN—The race to Election Day in November is in high gear.Voters are casting ballots either by mail or in early voting. The October 1vice presidential debatebetween Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrat, and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican, was likely the last meeting between the Democratic campaign led by Vice President Kamala Harris and the Republican campaign led by former President Donald Trump.While the scene is set for what pollsters expect could be an extremely close election,there will be unexpected developments between now and Election Day on November 5.Nobody expected President Joe Biden’scampaign to implodeafter theshock of his performance at CNN’s debate in late June. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Harris as his replacement.Nobody expected anassassination attempt against Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience.So we don’t know specifically what will happen between now andElection Day, or what could come after, when the country’s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect:Voting is well underwayCNNRelated articleYour personalized voter handbook for the presidential electionWhile Election Day isn’t until November 5, most states allow some kind of early voting, either by mail or in person, and that process kicks into overdrive in October.Most Americans, nearly 70%, voted early or by mail in 2020, according tocensus figures, although that figure was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.The campaigns will be focused on getting out the vote in the few key battleground states they think are up for grabs. In 2020, Biden won five states that Trump won in 2016. Those states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – could again be the focus in 2024 when Harris, who turns 60 in October, takes on Trump.It’s important to be sure you’re registered to vote as soon as possible, which can usually be done online. Twenty-three states and Washington, DC, allow Election Day voter registration.Election Day and beyondUS law requires federal elections to take place on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that’s November 5.People who don’t vote early will hit their local voting location. Polls will close at different times around the country. Due to the rise of voting by mail, if key states are close, like they were in 2020, we probably won’t know the winner on Election Day.Regardless, expect lawsuits in certain states and the potential for recounts in others. Election Day is far from the end of the election.Separately,Trump’s sentencingon 34 counts of falsifying business records is now scheduled for November 26.Also this month: Biden turns 82.December: Electoral votes are castAfter questions about the election are settled, states confirm, or ascertain, their statewide results. Electors gather in their respective state capitols to cast electoral votes for their statewide winner.Nebraska and Maine also allocate some electoral votes by congressional district, and these could be pivotal in a close race.January: Someone will solemnly swearThe new Congress takes the oath of office on January 3. It’s this new Congress that, in the unlikely event ofan Electoral College tie, would settle the election. Each state would get one vote for president in the House of Representatives.In any event, lawmakers gather on January 6, as everyone should remember from 2020, to count electoral votes. Harris will preside. She could either be thefifth vice president in historyto oversee her own Electoral College victory, or the fourth in history to oversee her own Electoral College defeat.On January 20, 2025, the next president takes the oath of office.This story has been updated with additional developments.","Score: 0

cnn,The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/politics/senate-race-rankings-october-2024/index.html,"CNN—With just over a month until Election Day, the same competitive races continue to dominate the Senate landscape, but there are a few significant changes to the order of CNN’s ranking of the seats most likely to flip.And in the final weeks, the degree to which these 10 races – which are mostly playing out in statesDonald Trumpeither won or narrowly lost in 2020 – move in the same direction as the presidential contest will likely determine which party wins control of the Senate.Republican Senate candidate for Montana Tim Sheehy walks up to the stage during a rally for Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump at the Brick Breeden Fieldhouse at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana, on August 9, 2024.Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images/FileRelated articleHow the Senate GOP’s potential majority maker is staying ‘shielded’ in push to oust Tester in MontanaRepublicans – who are virtually a lock to pick up the West Virginia seat and would need to either win the White House or pick up one more seat for the majority – have an incentive to nationalize many of their targeted races. Well-funded Democratic incumbents, for the most part, are touting statewide and local accomplishments and their support for abortion rights.Two states that are part of the Democratic “blue wall” – and also key White House battlegrounds – move up on this month’s rankings, which are based on reporting, as well as fundraising, polling and advertising data. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are now in the middle of the pack of flippable seats, along with Michigan, which remains at No. 4.The oddity of this year’s fight for the Senate is that Democrats have consistently led in the public polling of key races, but it’s Republicans who are poised to gain seats and, potentially, control of the chamber.That’s a reflection of the Senate map – but also increasingly some post-Labor Day tightening as GOP spending picks up and voters get to know their candidates. Still, no public general election polling that meets CNN standards has shown the Republican nominee ahead in any of the seats that Democrats are defending, save for West Virginia.And two GOP targets – Arizona and Nevada – are moving down the list because Republicans have not kept the races as competitive as elsewhere.Earlier this year, those two states were Nos. 4 and 5. Now, they’re at 7 and 8.Florida Sen. Rick Scott, left, and Texas Sen. Ted CruzGetty ImagesRelated articleSenate Democrats launch first multimillion-dollar TV investments in Texas and Florida as map grows more dauntingAt the same time, Democrats are trying to expand the map in hopes of mitigating potential losses. As CNNfirst reportedlast week, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is making multimillion-dollar TV investments in Texas and Florida. DSCC Chairman Gary Peters has insisted that this is extra spending that won’t take money away from their defensive priorities. Texas remains at No. 9 on CNN’s ranking, while Florida fell off the list earlier this year in favor of the race in deep-blue Maryland.Nebraska is a new state generating political buzz, but it hasn’t earned a place on the ranking. Still, independent Dan Osborn’s challenge to GOP Sen. Deb Fischer has prompted the National Republican Senatorial Committee to start spending here, and elections analysts have moved the race out of the solid Republican category.There remain lots of unknowns in Nebraska, but we’ll be watching to see how that race – and the 10 others – develop over the next month.1. West VirginiaSen. Joe ManchinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/FileWest Virginia is essentially out of reach for Democrats, who had little chance of holding this seat without Sen. Joe Manchin running for reelection. Manchin, now an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is likely to be succeeded by Republican Jim Justice, the state’s two-term governor.Justice has had his share of negative headlines, but in a state poised to back Trump by a significant margin, it’s hard to see a world in which Republicans don’t pick up this open seat.2. MontanaSen. Jon TesterAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileDemocrat Jon Tester, who’s running for a fourth term in a state Trump has twice carried by double digits, remains the most vulnerable Senate incumbent this year. Republicans feel confident their nominee,Tim Sheehy, has an edge – and both Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales and the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter have shifted their rating of the once toss-up race toward the GOP.Democrats still see a path to victory for Tester, who has a proven history of defying the partisan lean of his state by communicating both what he’s done for Montanans and painting a contrast with his opponents.Democrats are trying that playbook against Sheehy, trying to define the wealthy businessman and retired Navy SEAL, who moved to Montana in 2014, as an out-of-state carpetbagger who cannot be trusted. Recentlyunearthed audio recordingsof Sheehy using racist stereotypes to refer to Native Americans has played into that message, with Democrats arguing that he’s alienating a crucial demographic in the state. In a debate earlier this week, Sheehy acknowledged his comments were “insensitive,” saying, “I come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color sometimes.”Tester’s campaign is now leaning into abortion rights on the airwaves – an issue that’s on the ballot in Montana this year. Arecent adfeatures a self-described “life-long” Republican woman arguing that Sheehy “wants to take away personal freedoms.”But Republicans are invoking transgender issues in an attempt to cast Tester as a liberal who’s been changed by his years in Washington, while Sheehy istrying to tie Tester to KamalaHarris– especially on immigration. Tester – who has not endorsed in the presidential race – tried to meet those attacks during their debate by pointing out that Sheehy would not have supported this year’s bipartisan border bill that Republicans blocked.3. OhioSen. Sherrod BrownBonnie Cash/Getty Images/FileDemocratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing his toughest reelection in a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 points. Public polling still shows the three-term senator ahead of GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, although that is expected to tighten as more Republican voters come home to Moreno. Brown was at 47% to Moreno’s 43% in a late SeptemberNew York Times/Siena College pollamong likely Ohio voters – not far outside the margin of error. But the reassuring news for Democrats: Brown was winning 10% of Trump voters.Democrats have seized on Moreno’s recent comments at a town hall suggesting that some suburban women were single-issue voters when it comes to abortion and questioning why women over 50 would care about the topic. Brown pointed to the remarks as evidence that his opponent is out of step with the 57% of Ohio voters who last year approved a ballot measure protecting reproductive rights. WinSenate, a Democratic outside group, also launcheda new adwith a woman talking about the emergency abortion she underwent at 25 for an ectopic pregnancy, saying, “Our lives don’t belong in Bernie Moreno’s hands.”(Moreno’s campaign said in a statement that he was “clearly making a tongue-in-cheek joke about how Sherrod Brown and members of the leftwing media like to pretend that the only issue that matters to women voters is abortion,” and that Moreno believes women “care just as much about the economy, rising prices, crime and our open southern border as male voters do.”)The Senate contest in Ohio ranked as the most expensive congressional race on record, as of October 3, with total ad spending from both parties this cycle, including future reservations, exceeding $446 million, according to AdImpact. Brown – who announced raising $30.6 million in the third quarter – has continued totouthis work to pass the PACT Act to help veterans exposed to burn pits, while Morenotries to nationalizethe race by tying Brown to Harris and inflation and linking himself to Trump. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to GOP leadership, isattackingBrown over transgender issues to try to cast him as out-of-step with the partisanship of the state.4. MichiganSen. Debbie StabenowAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileMichigan remains the most competitive open seat on this list. Democrat Elissa Slotkin has held a narrow edge in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, but the absence of an incumbent and the competitiveness of the presidential race in the Wolverine State makes it one that could come down to the wire.Slotkin, a third-term congresswoman, led Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers 47% to 42% among likely voters in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll, with Slotkin drawing 6% of likely voters who also said they would vote for Trump. Slotkin has a strong fundraising record – her campaign announced raising $18 million in the third quarter – but Republicans are pouring more money into this state, with the Senate Leadership Fund recently announcing a $22.5 million investment.Slotkin has been runningads on abortion– an issue that has helped propel recent Democratic victories in the state. Herspotsclaim that Rogers’ past support for abortion restrictions makes him untrustworthy on the issue now. “I’m scared that Mike Rogers will continue to take away my rights,” says one woman in a spot who says she needed an abortion to save her life.Rogers has been responding on air, speaking directly to camera while holding hands with his wife inone new spot,saying he respects Michigan voters’ decision on abortion rights and “won’t do anything to change it” in the Senate.Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, scored the endorsement of the state Farm Bureau’s PAC, which had previously backed Stabenow (the chair of the Senate Agriculture panel). Rogers, whom Democrats have attacked for living in Florida after he left Congress a decade ago, is runningspotsthat tout his Michigan roots and public service. Rogers and Republicans are alsoattacking Slotkinandthe Biden administrationover plans to support the building of electric vehicles, using the misleading term “mandate.”5. PennsylvaniaSen. Bob CaseyAndrew Harnik/Getty ImagesDemocratic Sen. Bob Casey’s race against Republican challenger Dave McCormick moves two spots up on the list in light of heavy GOP outside spending, some tighter polling and the competitiveness of the presidential race in a state that is part of Democrats’ so-called blue wall of must-win states.September polling from Marist, Quinnipiac University, the New York Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer, Franklin & Marshall, CBS News/YouGov and Fox News all gave Casey anywhere from a 5- to 9-point lead among likely voters. Polls from CNN and The Washington Post around the same time, however, showed no clear leader.The two candidates, who met on the debate stage for the first time Thursday night, have been hitting the airwaves with competing messages, as have their allied outside groups. Democrats are going after McCormick onabortion,includingonead that features footage of him referring to himself as “pro-life.” The Senate Leadership Fund, which is adding $28 million to GOP sending here, and the pro-McCormickKeystone Renewal PAChave been attacking Casey over inflation andimmigration.McCormick’s tenure as the CEO of FreeMarkets – a Pittsburgh-based software company – has also been featured in ads on both sides.The Democratic group WinSenateis accusing him ofoutsourcing jobsand pointing to his management of the company to argue that “Connecticut Dave”  – he owns a home in the Nutmeg State – “wants to buy our Senate seat.” McCormick is running ads featuringformer FreeMarkets employeespraising him and touting the company’s hiring policies.6. WisconsinSen. Tammy BaldwinMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesWisconsin also moves up two spots on the list amid signs that some Republicans could be drifting home toward their party’s nominee, Eric Hovde, in his challenge to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.The two-term senator maintained a modest edge over Hovde in aMarquette University Law School pollreleased this week – 51% to 45% among likely voters when third-party candidates are included and 53% to 46% in a head-to-head matchup. Baldwin had a similar 7-point lead in aNew York Times/Siena College surveyof the two-person race taken around the same time.While Baldwin has repeatedly outraised Hovde, the Senate Leadership Fund is also pouring funds – $17 million – into the Badger State, and Hovde has plenty of his own money to pay for ads at the lower candidate rate if he chooses. (We’ll be eying his third-quarter fundraising filing for details about how much the Sunwest Bank CEO had loaned his campaign through September.) Ads from Hovde – whose campaign recently underwent a shakeup – havesought to tie Baldwinto Harris, attacking her over border security, fentanyl andtransgender rights.But Baldwin, who’s made an effort tovisit the red, rural parts of Wisconsin, has a well-defined brand. She picked up theendorsementof the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation this week – a notable get for a Democrat running statewide. Much of Democratic advertising has played up Hovde’s past controversial comments and sought to cast him as a California carpetbagger – he owns property in Laguna Beach, even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin and his family’s company is a prominent state brand.7. ArizonaSen. Kyrsten SinemaAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/FileArizona is a conservative-leaning purple state, where Republicans should ordinarily be able to pick off a Senate seat – especially an open one. But in the race to replace retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, Republican candidate Kari Lake seems to have hit a ceiling.The 2022 gubernatorial nominee is well known in the state, but not necessarily for the right reasons. She still refuses to accept her loss for governor and, despite tethering herself to Trump, is underperforming his polling numbers.Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego led Lake by 10 points among likely voters in aMarist polland 13 points in aFox News survey, both from mid-September. Lake was polling behind Trump in both surveys by 6 points and 8 points respectively.Lake and the NRSC areblaming Gallegofor inflation and immigration – pointing to his support for what they’re calling the “Kamala Inflation Act.” (Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.) And while the Senate Leadership Fund hasn’t spent here, a Club for Growth-affiliated group is also airingattackson the congressman. Gallego, a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was on the airwaves for months introducing himself to voters statewide as a Marine veteran and istouting his supportfrom law enforcement andRepublican voters. He announced raising $21.7 million in the third quarter.8. NevadaSen. Jacky RosenAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/FileNevada moves down two spots on the list as Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen appears to be in a stronger position against Republican opponent Sam Brown in a state where Democratic prospects seem to have picked up since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.Rosen, who appeared at a Harris rally in Las Vegas earlier this week, led Brown by 10 points in aCNN pollin late August. Like Lake in Arizona, Brown – an Army veteran who first ran for office in Texas and lost the GOP primary for Nevada’s other Senate seat last year – also appears to be running up against a ceiling.Rosen and Democrats are hitting Brownover his previous stances on abortion– which is on the ballot this year in Nevada. Brown, who says he supports current state law legalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks, has said he’d “close the door” on backing a national abortion ban.Rosen has had a fundraising edge over her opponent, and this week, national Republicans canceled their remaining independent expenditures in the state in favor of running hybrid ads with Brown, which allows them to benefit from the lower candidate rate in the ultra-pricey Las Vegas media market — a strategy they’ve employed in races across the country to try to compete with well-funded Democratic candidates on the airwaves.9. TexasSen. Ted CruzTierney L. Cross/Getty Images/FileNational Democrats’ decision toinvest TV resourcesin Texas was the first major signal the party is putting money where its mouth is on the competitiveness of the Lone Star State this year. Democrats see Republican Sen. Ted Cruz as unpopular and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred, as the man to beat him, even in a state that is still comfortably red at the presidential level.The first hybridadbetween Allred and the DSCC features Kate Cox, the woman who had to leave the state to seek an abortion after her fetus had been diagnosed with a deadly condition, and Amanda Zurawski, who sued the state after she was denied an abortion when experiencing complications. “If you’re experiencing pregnancy complications in Texas, you’re in danger,” Zurawski says in the ad, “and it’s Ted Cruz and the anti-abortion extremists’ fault.”Allred has also tried to flip the script on Republicans byaccusing Cruzof “doing nothing to secure the border.” Cruz, in turn, isattacking Allredover a vote related to the inclusion of transgender athletes in women’s sports. “Boys and girls are different,” is how anotheradfrom the Republican opens. “This election is about keeping Texas Texas,” Cruz has said.Cruz only beat Democrat Beto O’Rourke by 3 points in 2018. But Democrats hope that Allred, a former NFL player who flipped a Dallas-area House seat the same year, is a more formidable challenger and can turn out more minority voters. (Allred would be the state’s first Black senator if he wins.)Even Republicans acknowledge that Allred is running a good race, and the NRSC is investing here to help Cruz and the state party. Still, Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, so this remains an uphill battle for Allred.10. MarylandSen. Ben CardinAllison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP/GettyImages/FileThe race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin remains in tenth place this month as Angela Alsobrooks fights to keep this seat in party hands. Joe Biden won Maryland by 33 points in 2020, but Republican nominee Larry Hogan – a popular former two-term governor – has a supportive super PAC committing $18 million to tout hisindependence.Alsobrooks, the Prince George’s County executive, led Hogan by 11 points in a recentWashington Post/University of Maryland poll. She’s become better known statewide and has made gains among voters who say they care about Democrats maintaining control of the Senate. The argument that Hogan would be another vote for Senate Republicans has been Democrats’central pitchin deep-blue Maryland, especially onabortion rightsand Trump.Voters in the Post survey were split over whether Hogan would back his party’s leaders in the Senate. He’s winning nearly half of independents, as well as 18% of Democrats. And as he tries to combat Democratic attacks over abortion rights, he’s run ads about being“the ultimate girl dad”and “one of the few Republicans who never caved” to Trump. Hogan rejected the former president’s endorsement earlier this year, but Democrats quickly seized on Trump saying that he’d like to see Hogan win.Maryland’s Future, the super PAC backing Hogan, is trying to localize the race byattacking Alsobrooksfor improperly taking advantage of tax breaks she did not qualify for, as firstreported by CNN. (Her senior adviser told CNN that she was unaware of the problem and that her attorneys are working with both the District of Columbia and Prince George’s County to resolve the issue.)CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report.","Score: 0

cnn,Georgia judge says county election officials cannot delay or decline certification of election results,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/georgia-election-certification-2024/index.html,"CNN—County election officials in Georgia cannot delay or decline to certify election results, a state judge ruled Monday, dealing a blow to an effort by conservatives inthe critical battleground stateto gain the legal right to reject results based on a suspicion of fraud or abuse.“Election superintendents in Georgia have a mandatory fixed obligation to certify election results,” Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote in an 11-page ruling. “Consequently, no election superintendent (or member of a board of elections and registration) may refuse to certify or abstain from certifying election results under any circumstance.”In this November 2022 photo, people wait in line for early voting for the midterm elections at Ponce De Leon Library in Atlanta.Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images/FileRelated articleWhat to know about early voting in Georgia and North CarolinaThe case is one of the closely watched disputes over election certification in the critical battleground state. A ruling is still pending in a separate case brought by state and national Democrats against a rule from the State Election Board that requires local election officials to conduct a “reasonable inquiry” into election results before certifying them.McBurney said in his ruling that while local superintendents have an obligation to “investigate concerns about miscounts,” such concern “is not cause to delay or decline certification.”The case was brought by Julie Adams, a Republican member of the Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections, who had asked the judge to declare that her duties in certifying election results “are discretionary not ministerial.”“If election superintendents were, as Plaintiff urges, free to play investigator, prosecutor, jury, and judge and so – because of a unilateral determination of error or fraud – refuse to certify election results, Georgia voters would be silenced,” McBurney wrote. “Our Constitution and our Election Code do not allow for that to happen.”County election officials face a statutory deadline to certify the election results by November 12 this year.Fulton County has had legitimate problems running its elections and earlier this year the State Election Board reprimanded the county and ordered an independent election monitor because of issues that arose around the 2020 presidential election, including an incident where a batch of ballots were double-scanned during one of the 2020 recounts.But the extensive reviews of Georgia’s 2020 election – which included two machine vote counts and one hand count—did not reveal evidence of widespread fraud. Evidence has not emerged showing tally sheets were tampered with or drop box ballots were improperly taken by couriers, in 2020 or in subsequent elections.The Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Georgia, both of which had intervened in the case – with the backing of Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign – to oppose Adams’ arguments, celebrated the ruling Tuesday as a major legal win.“Election after election, in state after state, we have protected our elections from far-right Republicans trying to disrupt them, and Democrats remain ready to stand up and make sure every voter can cast their ballot knowing it will count. The experts were clear that the 2020 election was free, fair, and secure, and Democrats are making sure that the 2024 is the same,” the groups said in a joint statement.An attorney for Adams has not responded to CNN’s request for comment.In his ruling, McBurney handed Adams a small victory by saying that she had a right to request and receive access to “election information” ahead of certifying the results. But, the judge wrote, “any delay in receiving such information is not a basis for refusing to certify the election results or abstaining from doing so.”McBurney also stressed that concerns over potential election fraud or abuse can be raised by superintendents or others through post-certification court challenges known as “election contests.”“Importantly, election contests occur in open court, under the watchful eye of a judge and the public,” he wrote. “The claims of fraud from one side are tested by the opposing side in that open court – rather than being silently ‘adjudicated’ by a superintendent outside the public space, resulting in votes being excluded from the final count without due process being afforded those electors.”This story has been updated with additional developments.","Score: 0

cnn,"Why the Harris campaign has spent $11 million on a Facebook page with 1,000 followers",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/daily-scroll-facebook-harris-campaign-ads/index.html,"CNN—As Donald Trump and Kamala Harris feverishly chase undecided voters in the final stretch of the presidential campaign, millions of people in battleground states are being served ads on Facebook and Instagram from an obscure page calling itself “The Daily Scroll.”The social media ads, which are adorned with a nondescript logo resembling a pair of checkmarks, have promoted news articles from mainstream outlets including CNN, ABC and NBC, showing easing US inflation, cheaper insulin prices, and the consequences of state abortion bans.But the ads on Meta-owned platforms aren’t being paid for by any news outlet — they’re a product of Harris’ presidential campaign, which has spent heavily on social media platforms and embraced influencers to power her online efforts against Trump.Since Harris launched her bid for president this summer, her campaign has spent more than $11 million on Facebook and Instagram ads to promote The Daily Scroll into users’ feeds, a CNN analysis found. That made it the second biggest page by spending on political or social issues ads in the last 90 days, after only Harris’ main campaign page.A screenshot of The Daily Scroll, a Facebook page managed by the Harris for President campaign.From FacebookThe Harris campaign spent another $900,000 on ads from a similar news aggregator page dubbed “Headlines 2024.”The ads promoting The Daily Scroll have appeared on screens at least 700 million times, according to data from Meta’s Ad Library, with about 97% of views coming from seven battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina.All the ads include a disclaimer that they are “paid for by Harris for President,” and they do not appear to violate Meta’s rules for political advertisers.The Daily ScrollandHeadlines 2024pages are just a small part of a much wider effort to reach undecided voters across all forms of media, Kevin Munoz, a Harris campaign spokesperson, told CNN. Promoting news stories is just one of many digital strategies the campaign is using, in addition to traditional online display ads and short video clips to target voters on YouTube and other platforms, he said.A screenshot shows a ProPublica story shared on The Daily Scroll's Instagram story feature.From InstagramOverall, the Harris campaign has far outspent the Trump campaign on Meta’s platforms, spending nearly $80 million on ads since this summer, compared with about $9.4 million from Trump’s campaign and associated fundraising committees.Unlike the Harris campaign’s main Facebook and Instagram accounts, the ads run by The Daily Scroll and Headlines 2024 aren’t soliciting donations, and most of them aren’t directing users to the campaign’s website. Instead, the Harris team is using the ads to promote select news stories from major media outlets that reflect well on the Democratic presidential nominee and poorly on Trump.In recent months, the campaign has spent more than $2 million on The Daily Scroll to promotean ABC News storyabout slowing inflation — a major voter concern ahead of the election — which was viewed about 120 million times by Facebook and Instagram users in battleground states, according to the Meta database.A Harris campaign advertisement on Facebook promoting an ABC News report on cooling inflation.From Facebook“Good news for consumers – price increases have cooled significantly as inflation reaches the lowest point in over three years,” the ads declared.Other news reports promoted by the page includean NBC News articleon Trump boasting that his crowd sizes rivaled that of Martin Luther King Jr., aCNN videoof Harris speaking the day after Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, and astory from The Guardianreporting that the Project 2025 conservative policy blueprint will “gut labor rights.” The campaign spent more than $300,000 on ads promoting each of those reports.While the thousands of ads in the social media campaign have appeared in users’ feeds hundreds of millions of times, The Daily Scroll account itself appears dormant, with only a handful of public posts and roughly 1,000 followers. Headlines 2024 is even more sparse, with only about 100 followers and no posts at all. This is because Meta allows advertisers to run ads that don’t appear on the main feeds of the pages they are associated with.“The ads are clearly labeled as being paid for by the Harris campaign; there is nothing obviously deceptive about them,” said Peter Loge, director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, who previously worked in the Obama administration. “There is no generic-sounding PAC associated with them.”","Score: 1

cnn,Fact check: Vance falsely claims Trump did not ‘go after his political opponents’ as president,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/fact-check-vance-trump-political-opponents/index.html,"WashingtonCNN—Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, falsely claimed Sunday that former President Donald Trump “didn’t go after his political opponents” during his presidency – an assertion that is contradicted by a mountain of evidence.Vance, who saidFridaythat the attorney general would be the most important government official other than the president in a second Trump administration, wasaskedby ABC News host Martha Raddatz in an interview on Sunday if Trump would go after his political opponents. Vance said no, thenadded, “Martha, he was president for four years and he didn’t go after his political opponents.”Facts First:Vance’s claim is false. As president, Trump publicly and privately pressured the Justice Department, and others in his administration, to investigate or prosecute numerous political opponents.Trump madeextensive behind-the-scenes effortsto get his political opponents charged with crimes. But you don’t have to rely on investigative reporting or the memoirs of former administration officials to know that Trump went after political opponents as president.He often went after them in public, too.As CNN reporter Marshall Cohen hasnoted, there is a long list of political opponents whom Trump publicly called for the Justice Department and others to investigate or prosecute. The list includes not only 2016 election opponentHillary Clintonand 2020 election opponentJoe Bidenbut alsoBiden’s son Hunter Biden,Democratic former Secretary of State John Kerry,Trump’s former national security advisor turned critic John Bolton,Democratic former President Barack Obama,unspecified Obama administration officials,the anonymous author of a New York Times op-ed by a Trump administration official critical of Trump,MSNBC host and Trump critic Joe Scarborough,former FBI director turned Trump critic James Comey,other former FBI officials,former British spy Christopher Steele(the author of a controversial dossier of allegations against Trump), and various congressional Democrats – includingformer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,Rep. Adam Schiff of California,Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota,Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, andSen. Mark Warner of Virginia.Asked for comment for this article on Monday, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk accused the media of having a biased “double standard” and said “it is indisputable that under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s DOJ, the Republican nominee for president was targeted and indicted, while under President Trump, nothing like that ever transpired against either of the Democrats he faced off with in 2016 or 2020.”But that wasn’t for a lack of Trump trying.Trump repeatedly pressured the Justice Department as president to prosecute both Clinton and Biden, in addition totrying to get foreign countries to investigate Biden. That the Trump-era Justice Department declined to charge Clinton and Biden doesn’t mean it’s true that Trump didn’t “go after” them or others. (In fact, Trumpliterally saidin 2017 that he wanted the department to be “going after” Clinton.)John Kelly, whom Trump appointed as Secretary of Homeland Security and then White House chief of staff,told The New York Times in 2023of Trump: “He was always telling me that we need to use the FBI and IRS to go after people – it was constant and obsessive and is just what he’s claiming is being done to him now.”And contrary to Vance’s claim to Raddatz that Harris has herself tried to arrest political opponents, which Van Kirk echoed in her Monday statement to CNN, there is no public evidence that Harris pressured the Justice Department to prosecute Trump or her other opponents. The decision to bring two criminal cases against Trump – one over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and one over his post-presidency retention of classified documents – was made by a special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland.Trump made many public calls for investigations and prosecutions of political opponentsOn some occasions, Trump’s calls for investigations, arrests or prosecutions of his political opponentssoundedmore like vague gripesthan sincere attempts to prompt official action. On numerous occasions, though, Trump applied explicit, sustained public pressure on the Justice Department in general or his attorney general to pursue his opponents.For example, in 2017 and 2018, Trump frequently harangued then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions in tweets and public remarks to investigate various allegations against Clinton.“Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes,” hewrotein one tweet. “So where is the investigation A.G.,” hewrotein another tweet. “So many people are asking why isn’t the A.G. or Special Council (sic) looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes,” hewrotein another tweet. Inyet anothertweet, he noted allegations about Clinton, then wrote that “at some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper.”Trump made a directpublic requestin 2019 for Ukraine and China to launch investigations into Joe Biden and Hunter Biden – after he was already facing criticism forprivately pressuring Ukraine to investigate them. And in 2020, Trumppublicly demandedthat then-Attorney General William Barr indict Joe Biden, Obama and unspecified others over their supposed roles in the investigation into his 2016 campaign’s links to Russia.“Unless Bill Barr indicts these people for crimes, the greatest political crime in the history of our country, then we’re going to get little satisfaction unless I win and we’ll just have to go – because I won’t forget it. But these people should be indicted. This was the greatest political crime in the history of our country. And that includes Obama and it includes Biden,” Trumpsaid.Trump privately pressured the Justice DepartmentTrump suggested in that Fox News interview that he might have raised the subject of Biden and Obama indictments with Barr, saying, “I’ll be honest with you, he’s got all the information he needs. They want to get more, more, more, they keep getting more. I said, ‘You don’t need any more. You’ve got more stuff than anybody’s ever had.’”Trump privately pressured the Justice Department and Trump administration officials to go after other political opponents, according to former officials and news reports. And it appears he was sometimes successful, though it’s impossible to definitively prove a direct relationship between his demands and the department’s actions.Sessionstold special counsel Robert Muellerthat Trump pressured him in 2017 to abandon hisrecusalfrom investigations related to the 2016 election in order to prosecute Clinton, according to the Mueller report. Sessions did not do that, but heannounced in March 2018that he had (in November 2017) appointed a federal prosecutor to look into a variety of allegations against Clinton. She wasnever charged.The New York Timesreported this yearthat in April 2018, Trump told aides that if Sessions didn’t prosecute Clinton and Comey, Trump would prosecute them himself – prompting his White House counsel to write him a memo outlining the limits of the president’s powers.Boltonwrotein a 2020 book that Trump was “obsessed” with having Kerry prosecuted for supposedlybreaking a rarely enforced old lawbyremaining in contactwith Iranian officials after leaving office to try to preserve the nuclear agreement Kerry helped to negotiate. Bolton wrote that “in meeting after meeting in the Oval (Office), Trump would ask Attorney General William Barr or anybody listening to launch a prosecution.”The same week in 2018 that Trump tweeted that Kerry might have broken the law, the Justice Department assigned federal prosecutors to investigate Kerry,according to a bookby former federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman, who wasousted by Trump in 2020. Then, the same day Trump tweeted about Kerry in 2019, a Justice Department official called one of the prosecutors to apply more pressure over the case, Berman wrote. Kerry was never charged.In 2019, Barr satisfied Trump’s investigate-the-investigators demand bytaskinga federal prosecutor to help investigate the origins of the FBI’s probe related to Russia and the 2016 election. In late 2020, with about three months left in Trump’s presidency, Barr gave that prosecutor, John Durham,the status of special counsel.And in early 2020, Barrtaskeda different federal prosecutor with taking in information from members of the public,notably including then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, related to allegations about the Bidens and Ukraine, which had been a subject of Trump’s public and private focus.","Score: 1

cnn,"Democrats outspend Republicans on airwaves in crucial House races, with California and New York leading the way",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/house-election-tv-advertising/index.html,"CNN—Democrats have outspent Republicans ontelevision advertisementsin the races that will be crucial to decidingcontrol of the US House of Representatives, with California and New York seeing the highest spending by the two parties, according to a CNN analysis of advertising data from the first full month following the end of primary season.Both California and New York, while deep-blue at the statewide level, are home to buckets of highly competitive House seats that were key to Republicans gaining their narrow majority two years ago.Outside groups are playing an influential role in the race for the House, with a pair of leading super PACs from both parties collectively accounting for about a quarter of the $378 million in ad spending, while a wild card – a super PAC funded by cryptocurrency interests, which backs a bipartisan slate of pro-crypto candidates – dumped nearly $15 million more into the advertising fray.And the ads from some of the top spenders reflects the key issues that are driving voters, including the economy – always a top concern – as well as abortion rights, immigration, and crime.California and New YorkBetween September 11, the day after the last US House primaries finalized general election matchups across the country, and October 10, California and New York combined to draw about 29% of all ad spending targeting House races. Ten House races in California and six in New York are currently rated as competitive byInside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales.Republicans in both states are defending several seats that are held by lawmakers who won close contests in 2022 but thatJoe Bidenwould have carried two years earlier under the current lines.In New York, they include the 4th Congressional District, held by freshman Rep.Anthony D’Esposito, and a pair of upstate seats also represented by first-term lawmakers, Marc Molinaro (19th District) and Mike Lawler (17th District).The GOP is also trying to hold on to several competitive seats in California, mostly in territory that backed Biden in 2020. The vulnerable members include a pair of Central Valley congressmen – Reps. David Valadao of the 22nd District and John Duarte of the 13th District. Also on the list are Reps. Mike Garcia of the 27th District and Michelle Steel of the 45th District, both in the Los Angeles area, and Rep. Kevin Calvert, whose 41st District in the Inland Empire would have narrowly supportedDonald Trumpfour years ago.Top contestsWith those series of highly competitive contests beckoning, both California and New York have been flooded with ad money from outside groups, while grassroots donors, responding to battleground appeals, have helped the candidates push ad spending totals even higher. California, in particular, saw twice as much House ad spending in the month since the last primaries as any other state.And in the top 20 House contests for ad spending between September 11 and October 10, Democrats combined to outspend Republicans in 17 of them by a net of more than $30 million in total.The three races where Republicans led in ad spending wereNebraska’s 2nd District, California’s 22nd and Iowa’s 3rd – all three seats that the party is defending.In a few races – such as D’Esposito’s seat in New York; Duarte’s seat in California; Pennsylvania’s 7th District held by three-term Democratic Rep. Susan Wild; Colorado’s 8th District, home to freshman Democrat Yadira Caraveo; and Washington’s 3rd District, where Democratic Rep.Marie Gluesenkamp-Perezis seeking a second term – Democrats established large advertising leads in the first full month following the primaries, ranging from about $3 million to $4 million.Across all House races, a few leading outside groups from both parties accounted for a significant share of the ad spending totals. Congressional Leadership Fund, the top House GOP super PAC, spent nearly $60 million, 16% of the total in the month, while its Democratic counterpart, House Majority PAC, spent about $35.5 million, which was 9% of the ad spending total on House races over the 30-day period.Top advertisers and issuesCollectively, Congressional Leadership Fund and House Majority PAC accounted for more than a quarter of all the ad spending in the first full month since the last primaries, and the content of their TV ads reflects the messaging priorities for both parties.According to AdImpact data, Congressional Leadership Fund spent about $42 million on broadcast TV ads in those 30 days, and 39% went to ads that referencedimmigration, the top ranked issue in its advertising; CLF also spent more than a quarter of its total ad budget on spots that referencedcrime, and alsotaxes.On the other side, House Majority PAC spent more than $25 million on broadcast TV ads over the same period, and abortion rights dominated its TV ads more than any other issues by a wide margin – about 71% of the super PAC’s broadcast TV spend went to ads referencingabortion. HMP also spent nearly 40% of its TV ad budget on spots referencing crime, in many cases warning against thecriminalizationof abortion, while ads aboutcharacteraccounted for about 17% of its spending.In addition, Fairshake, a super PAC funded by cryptocurrency interests, has seized an influential role in the campaign, spending nearly $15 million since the final primaries on ads backing a bipartisan slate of industry-friendly candidates in 17 races. The spots praise the candidates’economic policiesand legislative records onother key issues.Looking aheadCampaigns and outside groups routinely book advertising time far in advance, and those future ad reservations are subject to change as candidates and their allies adjust their bookings and spend more campaign money.With three weeks to go before votes are counted in the 2024 election, though, House races in California and New York were poised to continue dominating the landscape, while Democrats held an overall edge in remaining future ad reservations.Including bookings between October 11 and Election Day, all advertisers in House races have combined ad reservations totaling more than $441 million, and Democrats lead Republicans by about $252 million to $183 million.California alone was set to see more than $89 million worth of advertising for House races over the final three and half weeks, while New York was set for more than $50 million – together, about a third of all the ad spending targeting the battle for the House in the crucial final stretch.","Score: 0

cnn,Fact check: What Trump keeps getting wrong about ‘paper ballots’,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/fact-check-trump-paper-ballots/index.html,"WashingtonCNN—After losing the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump has championed the baseless lie that the results were tainted by widespread fraud.To fix this made-up problem, Trump has proposed a four-part solution: The US should switch exclusively to paper ballots, requireproof of citizenshipto register to vote, require voters to show ID at the polls, and eliminate mail-in voting by holding the entire election in-person on just one day.Policymakers can debate the merits of forcing voters to prove their citizenship and provide ID. And mail-in voting, widely used by both Democrats and Republicans, isn’t going anywhere.But Trump’s comments on “paper ballots” havepuzzled voting expertsand election officials – because almost all voters nationwide already use paper ballots.Facts First:Trump’s insistence that the US switch to “paper ballots” is nonsensical. More than 98% of voters live in jurisdictions that produce fully auditable paper trails, according todata from Verified Voting, which tracks election equipment in every county.Trump brings up his four-part proposal almost every time he speaks about election integrity. He has mentioned the “paper ballots” claimdozens of timesthis year alone.“We’re going to fix our elections so that our elections are going to be honorable and honest, and people leave, and they know their vote is counted,” Trump said at anAugust rallyin Potterville, Michigan. “We are going to have free and fair elections. And ideally, we go to paper ballots, same-day voting, proof of citizenship – very big – and voter ID.”In aninterviewlast month, Trump said one way to “solve this problem” of mass fraud was to “go to paper ballots.” At arallyin Johnstown, Pennsylvania, he said, “we want to go to paper ballots.” And hesaid, “we want paper ballots,” in Montezuma Pass, Arizona.Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group, has spent the past two decades urging counties to move away from paperless voting in favor of in-person polling sites. (Vote-by-mail obviously incorporates a paper trail.) The people who run the group say they have accomplished their goal – despite claims from Trump and others that the US still needs paper ballots.“It’s really weird and I don’t understand it,” said Mark Lindeman, the group’s director for policy and strategy. “Almost everybody votes on paper ballots. Anyone who is convinced that we need paper ballots is very likely voting on paper ballots themselves.”Only about 1.4% of registered voters live in counties where there’s no paper trail of their ballot if they vote in-person, according to Verified Voting’s data. (If they vote-by-mail, then there is a paper trail.) These holdouts are the entire state of Louisiana and a few Texas counties.For everyone else, there are paper trails that can be checked during a post-election audit or recount.Nearly 70% of registered voters live in counties where voters physically mark their choices on a paper ballot.Another 25% of voters live in counties that use “ballot-marking devices,” where voters use a touchscreen or another interface to select their candidates, and then the machine fills out a paper ballot to reflect their selections.The remaining 5% of voters use electronic machines that record votes directly into the computer’s memory. But even most of these machines now create paper trails, too. The holdout counties in Texas and the entire state of Louisiana only store the votes on the computer memory.The share of voters in “paperless” counties has been steadily shrinking with every election cycle over the past 20 years, according to Verified Voting.Sherry Poland, elections director in Hamilton County, Ohio, which includes Cincinnati, said her county switched to hand-marked paper ballots in 2006, and that the system creates a “backup” and “redundancy” that should inspire confidence in the integrity of the process.“The trend is coming back now and everyone is realizing the value of having a paper trial,” said Poland, a Republican.After the 2016 election, battleground states like Pennsylvania andGeorgiatransitioned away from paperless machines and now use systems with paper trails. And since 2020, Tennessee and many counties in New Jersey, Texas, and Mississippi made the switch too.False and nonsensical claims about election procedures have had a negative impact on voter perceptions on the integrity of US elections, especially among Republicans.A majority of Trump supporters in Michigan, Arizona, and Pennsylvania now say they’re “not at all confident” or only “just a little” confident the results will be accurately tallied in their state, according torecent CNN polling. And one in five of Trump supporters said in a recentABC/Ipsos pollthat they aren’t prepared to accept the results of the election.“Twenty years ago, Verified Voting was founded to get rid of paperless (voting machines),” Lindeman said.“And now we’ve just about made it. We’re wondering why everybody isn’t happier.We’ve done this incredible thing together as a country.”","Score: 0

Listen to his words. He tells us who he is, and he tells us what he would do if he is elected president,” Harris told a large crowd in Pennsylvania after a weekend when Trump’s authoritarian rhetoric reached chilling new levels and hinted at the extreme nature of his potential second term.Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, meanwhile, went even further, suggesting the ex-president’s musings about using the military against domestic foes he branded“the enemy from within”could even amount to treason.Democratic presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally at the Williams Arena at Minges Coliseum on the campus of East Carolina University October 13.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesRelated articleHarris uses Trump’s ‘enemy from within’ comment to portray GOP rival as dangerous and unstableHarris and her team also aggressively questioned Trump’s mental fitness and his capacity to serve another term, turning the tables on the Republican nominee who for months leveled similar charges at President Joe Biden.In another effort by Harris to ease concerns about her apparently stalled momentum, she announceda major new initiativeto court Black male voters amid anxiety that Trump is making inroads into a critical Democratic support base or that they simply won’t turn out.And in a new ad campaign in swing state Arizona, Harris made fresh attempts to win over Republicans alienated by the ex-president’s behavior but who have yet to make what is for many a wrenching decision to cross party lines. To that end, Harris also announced that she’d sit down for her first formal interview with Fox News, dropping her earlier reticence over unscripted events to create a contrast with Trump, who rarely leaves the conservative media bubble.Former President Donald Trump holds a town hall in Oaks, Pennsylvania, on October 14, 2024.Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesA battle for PennsylvaniaHarris’ new efforts to dictate the pace of the election’s endgame came as both candidates campaigned in opposite corners of Pennsylvania. The commonwealth’s 19 electoral votes could well decide who wins the White House and, like a handful of other battlegrounds, it’s a toss-up according to latest polls.Harris is entering the decisive stretch of her political life. Her actions under the most intense pressure in the next three weeks will be watched by remaining voters who’ve yet to make up their minds and may be looking for a reason to pick her. She needs to also energize wavering or unenthusiastic Democratic-leaning voters who may not show up on Election Day.More broadly, the vice president faces one of the most daunting political assignments in decades, after taking over from Biden as the Democratic candidate months before the election. She’s trying to convince a disgruntled electorate that she’s a change candidate despite being part of an unpopular administration, while trying to take down Trump, who has shown there is almost nothing he won’t do to win back power.Yet Harris’ efforts to close the deal against the former president are being complicated by his refusal to meet her for a second debate after her strong performance in their first showdown in September gave her campaign a boost.An image of former President Donald Trump appears on screen as Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, on October 14, 2024.Jacquelyn Martin/AP‘You heard his words’In a new section of her stump speech, Harris played a tape for her rowdy crowd in Erie featuring Trump’s comment on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that he could turn the National Guard or regular military on “the enemy from within.”“You heard his words,” Harris said. “He’s talking about the enemy within Pennsylvania … he considers anyone who doesn’t support him or who will not bend to his will an enemy of our country.” The vice president added: “Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged, and he is out for unchecked power.”Just before Harris spoke, her running mate unveiled the Democratic ticket’s most explicit assessment yet of Trump’s potential threat to basic political freedoms if he wins a second term. Walz, the Minnesota governor, said the idea a president could use troops against Americans made him “sick to my stomach.”And the Army National Guard veteran highlighted a comment by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley that Trump was a “fascist to his core,” which was reported in Bob Woodward’s new book “War.” Walz added: “Let that sink in, and don’t be a damn bit afraid of saying it, because that’s exactly who he is. That’s exactly who he is.”Trump’s vice presidential nominee JD Vance, however, defended his boss’ remarks. “Is it a justifiable use of those assets if they’re rioting and looting and burning cities down to the ground? Of course it is. Right?” the Ohio senator said in Minneapolis. “I think the question is, is it a justifiable use of assets? Depends on what’s actually happening.”Video Ad FeedbackWhy former defense secretary fears Trump would try to utilize military against US citizens03:28- Source:CNNIntensifying Democratic rhetoric about Trump comes as Democrats begin to consider the implications of the ex-president winning a toss-up election and securing a second term that is likely to be even less restrained that his first. Former President Barack Obama set the tone during his own swing through Pennsylvania last week.Harris suggested in an interview with Roland Martin that Trump had something to hide. “He will not debate me again. I’ve put out my medical records, he won’t put out his medical records. And you have to ask, why is his staff doing that? And it may be because they think he’s just not ready, and unfit, and unstable, and should not have that level of transparency for the American people.”In an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” second gentleman Doug Emhoff raised questions about the 78-year-old former president’s mental and physical condition. Like his wife did, he noted that Trump had backed out of a “60 Minutes” interview and said, “It’s just obvious by looking at him, listening to him, you can see the degradation in front of your eyes.”He added: “He’s a degrading version of an already horrible person so he’s just getting worse and worse.”Vice President Kamala Harris greets the crowd at a rally, in Erie, Pennsylvania, on October 14, 2024.Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersA critical county that could decide the electionAt her rally in Erie, Harris put on an energetic show that looked like an attempt to ease Democratic anxiety that the momentum she built up after taking over from Biden in July has not translated into a clear lead over the ex-president.“We will win. We will win,” she insisted with a beaming smile.Erie County, in far northwestern Pennsylvania, is a study in miniature of the wider strategic nationwide battle facing Harris and Trump in the next three weeks. Biden won the county by 1 percentage point in 2020, but the former president carried the county by nearly 2,000 votes in 2016 on the way to the White House. The city of Erie is a Democratic stronghold, but the fight between Harris and Trump will be intense among moderate voters in the suburbs and Trump will seek to run up huge margins in rural and farming communities.The twice-impeached former president appeared at a town hall event in Oaks, northeast of Philadelphia, with South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who is a star in the conservative media firmament.The event highlighted issues like the cost of living and housing that Trump’s team sees as the key to the election. One of the most critical questions before undecided voters in the coming days is whether pressures bearing down on many American families — for instance, over high grocery prices – will outweigh concerns about Trump’s extremism and threats to democracy.Harris was not the only candidate tending to a vital constituency on Monday. (She unveiled a plan to boost access to finance for Black men who want to start businesses and a health initiative to increase screenings for conditions that disproportionately affect the community). Trump sought to make inroads with young men who are often low-propensity voters but who could add to his coalition.He appeared on the Nelk Boys’ “Full Send” podcast, which has more than 2 million subscribers on YouTube, and chatted authoritatively about UFC martial arts stars in exchanges that displayed the kind of authenticity many voters like. He also appeared to confirm that he would appear on Joe Rogan’s hugely popular podcast in the latest example of how both he and Harris are seeking out non-traditional media sources to reach Americans who often don’t vote.","Score: 1

cnn,Why working-class White women could be so decisive this fall,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/female-voters-decisive-election-blue-wall-states/index.html,"CNN—There is one conspicuous weak spot in the formidable wall of supportVice President Kamala Harrishas built among female voters. And that opening may representformer President Donald Trump’s best chance to tip the states that remain most likely to decidethe razor-thin presidential race.Even as Trump struggled with other groups of women in his 2016 and 2020 presidential races, exit polls and other analyses showed that he amassed a big lead each time among White women without a college education.Those working-class White women loom as a critical, potentially even decisive, factor in Trump’s third White House bid. That’s partly because so many of them, polls show, are torn between personal disdain for Trump and discontent with the results ofJoe Biden’s presidency, particularly over inflation and the border.But it’s also because these women are especially plentiful in the three former “blue wall” states that stillconstitute Harris’ most likely pathto an Electoral College victory: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. To win those states, which she is barnstorming every day this week, Harris doesn’t have to win most of those women – Democrats almost never do – but she does need to remain competitive with them.“They are really tired of Trump, and they’d really like to move on, but they are also nervous about moving on, and they do think the economy was better for them under Trump,” said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. As for Harris, Lake said, “They like she would bring everybody together, they like her empathy. … But they don’t feel that they know her that well.” The sum total of these contradictory impulses is that, “They are really torn,” Lake said. “They feel very insecure about these choices.”One measure of how much Democrats prioritize these blue-collar White women is the massive voter contact program that American Bridge 21st Century, a party super PAC, is targeting at them. The group is spending about $140 million to try to reach 3 million women, predominantly White women without a college degree, just in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the three states that Trump in 2016 knocked out ofwhat I termed the “blue wall.”Vice President Kamala Harris attends a campaign event in Flint, Michigan, on October 4, 2024.Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters“In general, the blue wall states are still the path of least resistance to 270” for Harris, said Bradley Beychok, a co-founder of American Bridge 21st Century. “But I think it’s pretty clear that women are the determinative demographic of this election cycle, and they have been the last few election cycles, so it’s not rocket science.”American Bridge has pursued these blue-collar women through an extraordinarily long engagement that began in 2023 by regularly mailing them newspapers produced by an affiliated group. The effort has included multiple rounds of contacts and testimonial ads from former Trump voters delivered through every available platform, from television and digital to mail and streaming services. Beychok said one of the group’s strongest messages is reminding voters of the uncertainty and volatility that comes with Trump.Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a rally at the Dort Financial Center in Flint, Michigan, on October 4.Mark Schiefelbein/APRelated articleHarris advisers zero in on Michigan strategy to overcome anticipated losses among some parts of Democratic coalition“If you show folks, gee you put this guy back in the White House and you’ll have a sense of unrest and disorder in your community … people say, ‘I don’t want that,’” Beychok said. Similarly, he added, “If Donald Trump is proud that he made good on his threat to ban abortion, and overthrow Roe v. Wade, and you know he’s an agent of chaos, then what [rights] will” he threaten next?Beychok said the group’s guiding principle is that even small gains with these women can prove decisive across narrowly divided states. “We may not get to 50.1 with them, but if we run a program to get what is available to us … it can be just as effective,” he said.In fact, winning a majority of these women has not been a realistic goal for Democrats. In exit polls dating to 1980, the only Democratic presidential nominee who carried even a plurality of White women without a college degree on a national basis was Bill Clinton in 1996. Democrats stayed close among these women again in the razor-thin 2000 race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. But while White womenwitha college degree have trended toward the Democrats in the presidential campaigns since then, the White womenwithouta college degree have moved sharply in the opposite direction.The Republican presidential nominees won just under three-fifths of these working-class White women in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 races, while Trump pushed his share with them over three-fifths in both the 2016 and 2020 races, according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. Other well-respected analyses of the 2016 and 2020 vote likewise showed Trump winning about three-fifths of these women,with the Democratic targeting firm Catalistputting Trump just below that threshold each time,and the Pew Research Center’s Validated Votersstudy putting Trump just underneath it in 2016 and just above it in 2020.Supporters of former President Donald Trump cheer during a campaign rally on October 9, 2024, in Reading, Pennsylvania.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe GOP advantage in those national figures is inflated by its imposing advantage among these women in Southern states, where many of them are culturally conservative evangelical Christians who support the GOP in overwhelming numbers.Critically for Democrats, in the pivotal battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, they have usually run a few points better with these women than they do nationally. In Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection victory, for instance, he only won about one-third of these women nationally, but he carried about 45% of them in both Michigan and Pennsylvania and won a narrow majority of them in Wisconsin, the exit polls found. By contrast, in 2016, Hillary Clinton,the exit polls found, stalled out at around 40% support from them in all three states, which contributed to her losing Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by a combined margin of roughly 80,000 votes – and with them the presidency.Compared with Clinton in 2016,Biden in 2020 posted a small but critical improvement among these women in Michigan and Wisconsin, contributing to his victories there,exit polls found. Biden ran only about as well as Clinton did with them in Pennsylvania, where he flipped the state primarily by vastly expanding on her margin in the heavily college-educated suburbs of Philadelphia.GREENVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA - OCTOBER 13: Democratic presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally at the Williams Arena at Minges Coliseum on the campus of East Carolina University October 13, 2024 in Greenville, North Carolina. With 22 days until the election, recent polls in North Carolina show Harris and her opponent Republican presidential candidate, former President Donald Trump within just a point or two on average, which is also the case in the other six key battleground states. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesRelated articleHarris unveils new proposals targeting Black men as she looks to shore up Democratic coalitionWorking-class White women in the former blue wall states may be even more central to Harris’ fate than they were to Biden’s. Even most Democrats acknowledge Harris may struggle to fully match Biden’s showing among almost all the major groups of male voters, especially White men without a college degree, as well as Black, Latino and younger men.Because Biden won Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by a combined margin of nearly 260,000 votes, Harris has a cushion to sustain some erosion among men. But Lake, like many other Democrats, believes that to win the three big Rust Belt battlegrounds – and for that matter,anyof the swing states – Harris will likely need to run at least slightly better than Biden did among women. “She is going to have to do better with women,” Lake said flatly. “She has to make up for the fact that she won’t do as well with the men as he did.”Polls show Harris has a good chance at improving over Biden’s 2020 performance with one group of women in all of the battlegrounds, including the former blue wall states: White women with at least a four-year college degree.In the 2022 midterm – the first election held after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion – the Democratic gubernatorial nominees in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsinall ran notably betteramong these women than Biden had two years earlier.Recent surveys by Quinnipiac Universityshowed Harris also drawing about two-thirds of these college-educated White women in all three of the former blue wall states,as did a recent Wisconsin poll by the Marquette Law School.Harris’ position is less certain among women of color. Many polls have shown her facing some decline compared with 2020 among bothBlackandLatinowomen, but Democrats feel more confident about her ability to regain most of that ground than they do about her odds of undoing the shortfall with minority men, especially Latinos.That leaves the working-class White women as the biggest wild card among female voters.“They are weighing a lot of things,” said Republican pollster Christine Matthews. “They could very well be deliberating up until the very last minute.”Their choices will be especially important in the former blue wall states because the blue-collar White women are so numerous there.In a new analysis shared exclusively with me, William Frey, a demographer at the nonpartisan Brookings Metro think tank, has calculated that these White women without a college degree will comprise a huge share of eligible voters in these pivotal states. According to his analysis of the latest census data, they will represent over one-fourth of adults eligible to vote in both Michigan and Wisconsin and almost exactly one-fourth in Pennsylvania. In all three states, he found they represent roughly as big a share of the eligible voting population as the blue-collar White men who are Trump’s strongest group and a bigger group of eligible voters than either White men or women with a college degree, or non-White men or women. Every vote from every group, of course, counts the same, but the blue-collar White women are a big enough bloc that even minuscule shifts in their preference, or turnout, could easily tip these precariously balanced states.One word from Trump’s speech during a recent Wisconsin rally offers the best window on how he is pursuing these working-class White women. Talking about undocumented migrants, he declared, “They will walk into your kitchen, they’ll cut your throat.” Trump didn’t say immigrants would walk through the front door or into the living room. He specifically said they would come into akitchen, where many women, particularly in working-class households, can easily envision themselves alone and vulnerable.Former President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Dodge County Airport on October 6, 2024, in Juneau, Wisconsin.Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APThat was just one salvo in the barrage of messaging from Trump and his allies – in speeches and in advertising – that seeks to simultaneously trigger fears of crime from undocumented immigrants, portray Harris as too weak and too liberal to protect people from it, and to present himself as the strongman, in all senses of that word, who can provide that protection.Jackie Payne is the founder and executive director of Galvanize Action, a liberal group that studies moderate White women, primarily those without college degrees. She acknowledges that Trump’s alarms have resonated among working-class White women, especially older ones. These women, she said, “express some of the fear around the border crisis; safety and security of their family is a top priority, and they identify the border crisis as a threat.”But at the same time, Payne said, for many of these women, the vehemence and vitriol of Trump’s attacks on immigrants –the dehumanizing language and lurid accusations– is also triggering their greatest concern about him: that he’s too divisive, disruptive and chaotic.Trump, Payne said, is “making the bet” that voters fearful about their safety will accept language and threats from him about immigrants that they consider “ugly” if they believe such vehemence to be “ the price of strength and protection.” But, she added, “At the same time, we see a revulsion and disgust at the way we are talking about other humans.”Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania Ed Fry Arena, Monday, Sept. 23, 2024, in Indiana, Pa. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)Alex Brandon/APRelated articleThe unexpected gender dynamic shaping the 2024 electionTrump’s other big asset with these women is the economy. Many working-class White women live with very little economic margin, and pollsters agree the cumulative increase under Biden in the cost of living – notwithstanding inflation’s decline over recent months – has almost eclipsed any of his other economic accomplishments, such as the strong job market.“If you are just getting by and living paycheck to paycheck, that increase in basic groceries did a number on you and you are very focused on the economy,” said GOP pollster Jon McHenry.McHenry said in his polling, significantly more of these blue-collar women say they were doing better economically under Trump than Biden.The latest national New York Times/Siena surveyreinforces that finding: Among White women without a college degree, 54% said Trump’s policies had helped them personally, while a nearly identical 53% said Biden’s policies had hurt them, according to unpublished results provided by Siena. These women may feel a stronger personal connection with Harris than they did with Biden, McHenry noted, but poll results such as those make clear they don’t believe “that things are magically better because Joe Biden withdrew from the election. They are still feeling the effects of inflation; they are still not happy about the border.”College-educated White women don’t give Biden’s policies great ratings in the Times/Siena poll either. But both Mathews and Payne point out that’s almost irrelevant to the decision for most of them: Trump himself provides the motivation for their vote. “When I look at White college women, I see them as motivated by choice, abortion and defeating Donald Trump,” said Matthews. “They are negatively motivated by him; they want him gone.”In the 2022 exit polls, a solid majority of blue-collar White women also backed abortion rights across Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to results provided by the CNN polling unit. The Democrats’ problem is not that these women don’t support legal abortion; it’s that fewer of them prioritize it as much as their female counterparts who are college-educated, single or younger.“For White non-college women, even if they are offended by some of this stuff coming out of the Trump and Vance campaigns, the misogynistic comments, they are really focused on being able to feed a family of four on their income,” Matthews said. “They are cross-pressured and they don’t like what they are hearing. But they think he would do better on the economy and prices would go down, and that is the most pressing and relevant issue.”In one of her campaign’s most notable achievements, Harris has become more competitive on economic issues; even if more voters still say they trust Trump to handle the macro-economy, she’s narrowed the gap in multiple polls on questions such as holding down costs or who cares about people like me. Her recent media offensive seemed aimed, above all, at buttressing those perceptions: across the many podcasts, town halls and talk show appearances the most powerful through line in her message seemed to be to say to women: I have lived your life, so I understand what public policy must do to make it easier and more secure – with everything from a restored child tax creditto Medicare coverage for home health carefor more seniors.Supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris hold up signs during a campaign event in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, on September 13, 2024.Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersPayne said the key for Harris is to “at least draw even on ‘you can trust me to deliver for your family.’” If she can do that, Payne said, more working-class women will feel comfortable voting for “a vision of America that they want to raise their kids in. They don’t want conflict, they don’t like the polarization and division.”The toughest question for Democrats is how Harris’ gender may affect the decisions of these working-class White women across the Rust Belt. To this day, some Democrats believe one key reason Clinton narrowly lost the former blue wall states in 2016 was that too many of these women remained uneasy with a female president, particularly around issues of security.In polling this fall, Payne’s group found that Trump holds a big lead over Harris among White women who score high on what social scientists call “internalized sexism” – a tendency to defer to men – while Harris held a commanding lead among those who scored low on that measure.A recent national Gallup Pollpoints in a similar direction. White women without a college degree were far more likely to identify Trump than Harris as a strong leader and someone who would display good judgment in a crisis, according to unpublished results provided by Gallup. Not only college-educated White women, but also the equivalent White men were much more likely than the blue-collar White women to express positive views about Harris and negative ones about Trump, Gallup found.“I think there is a lot of implicit [gender] bias with” these working-class White women, Lake said. “And given the short time frame, I’m not sure we’re on top of it. They have competing notions of Trump. On the one hand, he’s chaotic, unstable, he’s definitely looking older, he is dividing people, he is causing instability in communities. But on the other hand, they think he’s a strong man and they like strong men.”How a few thousand conflicted and ambivalent working-class White women in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin sift through these competing views may decide the statesthat remain the most likely to determine the next president.","Score: 0

We fucked it up. Barack never took Putin seriously.”Putin had a heated call with Biden in the run-up to Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, in which the Russian president threatened a nuclear war. Later, Biden’s national security team assessed there was a 50% chance Putin might use a tactical nuclear weapon during the Ukraine conflict. It is worth noting that back in March, CNN’s Jim Sciutto had similardetailed reportingabout Putin’s possible use of a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine in late 2022.As has been the case for previous Woodward books, those who don’t come out well from his reporting publicly dismiss it.

Even before “War”goes on sale Tuesday, it’s already No. 5 on Amazon’s bestseller list, so it could also be on the way to being Woodward’s 16th No. 1 New York Times bestseller, an astonishing record of success.Woodward has a penchant for one-word titles for his books about Trump: “Peril,” “Rage” and “Fear.” He has also written extensively about the post-9/11 wars in books such as “Bush at War” and“Obama’s Wars.” So how does“War” stack up against those books, and what are its big themes?At the heart of “War,” Woodward reports about how Biden’s national security team handled three wars: in Afghanistan, the Ukraine conflict, and the war in Gaza, now in its second year, which has embroiled the Middle East in a widening conflict.Like Woodward’s several other books about war, the front lines of the conflicts he covers are not on the battlefields but in the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room. I reviewedWhite House visitor logsshowing that Robert Woodward (his legal name) visited the White House more than two dozen times from December 2022 to April 2024, a period that “War” covers in detail.Woodward rarely strays far from this apex of American power. As a result, “War” is not suffused with the sound of gunfire, but the ringing of cell phones as senior Biden officials get on secure conference calls.Video Ad FeedbackGangel breaks down most shocking revelations from Woodward's new book06:35- Source:CNNWoodward notes that neither Biden nor Trump spoke to him for this book, but he still got great access. It’s clear from a close reading of “War”that almost every top national security official in the Biden administration spoke with him. Those officials did so surely because they understood that if they didn’t talk to Woodward, their peers certainly would. So, if they wanted to get their version of history told, it only made sense to cooperate with the legendary reporter, who, at age 81, has more energy and puts in more shoe leather than reporters half his age.Typically, in Woodward’s books, he lets his reporting speak for itself and doesn’t make sweeping pronouncements that tell the reader about his own conclusions, but“War”is different. Woodward, who has covered every president since Nixon, writes that Trump is “not only the wrong man for the presidency, he is also unfit to lead the country. Trump was far worse than Richard Nixon, the provably criminal president. … Trump was the most reckless and impulsive president in American history.” Ouch!By contrast, the final sentence of “War”asserts, “Based on the evidence available now, I believe President Biden and this team will be largely studied in history as an example of steady and purposeful leadership.”Biden’s Afghan withdrawal fiascoYet, that conclusion of steady and purposeful leadership is quite at odds with the fiasco of thechaotic US withdrawalfrom Afghanistan in the summer of 2021, which handed the country back to the Taliban, and during which a suicide bomber killed 13 American service members and some 170 Afghans. This was an own goal scored by Biden’s decision to goagainst the advice of his top generals, who told him the withdrawal of the small contingent of 2,500 US troops then in Afghanistan would lead to the collapse of the Afghan military.Collapse it did, and now the Taliban rule over Afghanistan with aniron, misogynistic fistenabled by many billions of dollars of military equipment that the US left behind. The Taliban are also accommodating some 20 terrorist organizations,according to the United Nations.The Afghanistan withdrawal also signaled to Putin that the US was withdrawing from the world in general, which seems to have accelerated his plans to invade Ukraine. Woodward’s reporting underlines this point. He writes that top generals at the Pentagon learned that a few weeks after the Afghanistan withdrawal, “new pieces of intelligence were coming in that suggested Russia was planning a large-scale military attack on Ukraine.”Biden then dispatched CIA Director Bill Burns, who had dealt with Putin during his stint as US ambassador to Russia, to warn the Russian leader that the US knew he was planning an invasion of Ukraine and to try to dissuade him. Along with Burns on the trip to Russia was the National Security Council director for Russia, Eric Green. According to Woodward, Green “picked up a sense that the Russians were feeling kind of full of themselves after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.” Green told Woodward, “I think it reinforced Putin’s conception about how easy it would be. … Here’s a military force that has been supported by the US for decades at that stage. They just collapsed. The Americans didn’t back them up.”Biden gets it right on UkraineBy contrast, the Biden team did show real leadership when it tried to warn the world of Putin’s impending invasion of Ukraine and then, when it happened, steadily supplied the Ukrainians with weapons and substantial aid so that they have held off the Russians for more than two and a half years. This has all been achieved without any American boots on the ground, a key Biden goal for the war.In the lead-up to the invasion of Ukraine, Biden and his team warned in private discussions with the Ukrainians and NATO allies that, based on their intelligence, Putin was close to invading. They also innovated by making this intelligence public. Not surprisingly, this was met with some initial resistance from the US intelligence community, yet it was smart policy. After all, secrecy serves policy; it is not a policy goal in and of itself.On December 3, 2021, The Washington Postran a storyheadlined, “Russia planning a massive military offensive against Ukraine involving 175,000 troops, U.S. intelligence warns.” Although this declassification of intelligence didn’t, in the end, stop Putin from invading Ukraine, it likely made NATO allies and the Ukrainians better prepared for how to respond once the invasion began.Two women watch US President Joe Biden making statements on a news channel in a subway station turned into a shelter in Kyiv on March 8, 2022.Vadim Ghirda/AP/FileIf the Afghanistan withdrawal was a spectacular own goal scored by Biden himself since he was the leading proponent of the policy, the Biden administration’s response to the Ukraine invasion was about as good as it gets. Biden wanted to support the Ukrainians substantially but did not want to trigger World War III inadvertently. That policy has largely been a success. When US intelligence found that Putin was seriously contemplating using a tactical nuclear weapon, the Biden administration “mobilized every communication line, calling the Chinese, the Indians, the Israelis, the Turks — countries friendly with Russia” to get them to tell Putin to stand down. He did.One of Putin’s key goals when he invaded Ukraine was to ensure the country never joined NATO. Instead, because of the invasion, Putin made NATO Great Again. Multiple NATO countries started ramping up their own spending on defense, and the alliance added two new members, the formerly neutral states ofSwedenandFinland, Russia’s neighbor.While the war has stalemated now with a slight advantage to the Russians, who are advancing slowly in eastern Ukraine, in August, the Ukrainians seized hundreds of square miles of territoryin the Kursk regionof Russia itself, which they have retained. No matter how much Putin’s propagandists proclaim that victory is close, the Russians are estimated to have already suffered 600,000 dead and wounded, according to a Pentagon briefing last week.The Middle East regional war Biden tried to avoidA year afterHamas attacked Israel, killing some 1,200 Israelis, the Biden team has not prevented an escalating regional conflict. Instead of showing purposeful leadership, the Biden administration has repeatedly handed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a blank check, which he has used to carry out large-scale attacks not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank and Lebanon, as well as more targeted operations in Syria and Yemen.The war is Gaza has claimed the lives of 42,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, while the death toll in Lebanon is more than 1,500 since Israel launched a ground operation there in recent weeks, and a million Lebanese have fled their homes,according to the UN.President Joe Biden leaves the room at the end of a press conference following a solidarity visit to Israel on October 18, 2023, in Tel Aviv.Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, the Houthis in Yemen have effectively shut down shipping through thekey Red Sea global trade routeusing Iran-supplied missiles and drones and have also fired them at Israel. In the past six months, Iran has launched two massive attacks on Israel using ballistic missiles and drones, widening the war to the regional conflict that the Biden administration was strenuously seeking to avoid when Hamas launched its attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023.The possibility of a ceasefire with Hamas and the return of the hostages held by the terrorist groupseems quite remoteat this point since the leader of Hamas in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, and Netanyahu are unwilling to compromise, and both seem to believe that the continuation of the war benefits their interests.On Sunday, the Israeli Cabinet met to decide how to respond to the most recent Iranian missile strike on Israel two weeks ago. Biden has urged the Israelis not to strike Iranian nuclear sites. Let’s see whether they listen. The record so far has not been encouraging.Biden’s unwavering support for Netanyahu even has a name — “the bear hug”— and while the president has occasionally protested publicly about the level of casualties in Gaza, the de facto policy is strong support for Israel; for instance, the Biden administration is going forward with the sale of $18 billion of F-15 fighter jets to the country.Earlier this year, the Biden administration tried without success to get Netanyahu not to attack the densely populated Gazan city of Rafah, where an estimated 1.5 million Palestinians were sheltering, many of them evicted from their homes earlier in the conflict.Biden called Netanyahu on February 15, 2024, telling him, “We already said we are not going to support an operation absent a plan to get civilians out of harm’s way.” Netanyahu ignored this warning and went ahead with the attack on Rafah. Woodward’s assessment of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s efforts to rein in Netanyahu during this period is damning and direct: “It was obvious Blinken had no influence.”It’s mystifying why the Biden administration hasn’t used more of its considerable leverage over Netanyahu; after all, in the past year, the US has approved $17.9 billion for security assistance to Israel, according to a report by Brown University released last week; the most aid in any year that the US has ever sent to Israel. The Biden administration has halted the shipment of massive 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, but otherwise, the large flow of American weapons to the Jewish state continues.Vice President Kamala HarrisThough Vice President Kamala Harris adorns the cover of “War”— likely a marketing decision given her presidential run — she does not play a prominent role in the book compared with Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and national security adviser Jake Sullivan.Yet, when Harris appears in the book, she does give sound advice. When Biden asked her what her view was in mid-April after Iran had fired some 300 missiles and drones at Israel, almost all of which were then shot down by Israel, the US and other allies, Harris said simply, “Tell Bibi to take the win.”Vice President Kamala Harris gives remarks alongside President Joe Biden at Prince George’s Community College on August 15, 2024, in Largo, Maryland.Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesHarris also has one of the funnier lines in the book, saying Biden likes her company because “he knows that I’m the only person around who knows how to properly pronounce the wordmotherfucker.” Indeed, we learn from Woodward that “Joe from Scranton” sure does use the F-word a lot, particularly when it comes to Netanyahu, who Biden variously describes as one of “the biggest fucking assholes in the world,” “a bad fucking guy” and “a fucking liar.” And for good measure, Biden yells at Netanyahu, “Bibi, what the fuck?” after the Israelisassassinated a Hezbollah leaderliving in a densely populated area of the capital of Lebanon, also killing at least three civilians.“War” is a deeply reported account of the wars on the Biden administration’s watch. At the same time, its overall assessment that the Biden team showed purposeful leadership regarding these conflicts isn’t supported by the facts of the Afghan withdrawal, the present conflagration in the Middle East, and even Woodward’s own reporting. However, regarding Ukraine, the Biden administration has operated very deftly, keeping NATO together and expanding the alliance while avoiding any direct American involvement in the war that might have triggered an escalatory response from the Russians. Certainly, this is a real achievement that Biden can savor when he enjoys his well-earned retirement back in Delaware.It is anyone’s guess what Trump might do about Ukraine if he were to win the presidency, given the former president’s odd bromance with Putin, which even top aides such as Trump’s director of national Intelligence, Dan Coats, cannot explain. Coats told Woodward, “It’s still a mystery to me how he deals with Putin and what he says to Putin. … It’s an enigma, and it hasn’t been broken yet.”Trump has claimed he could quickly settle the Ukraine conflict, but since the Russians and Ukrainians have been at war for a decade since Putin first seized Crimea in 2014, this seems like wishful thinking.","Score: 0

cnn,Why education level has become the best predictor for how someone will vote,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/the-biggest-predictor-of-how-someone-will-vote/index.html,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.WashingtonCNN—American voters are divided in many ways – by gender, by race, by region – and any of these can be used to explain the current state of politics.More women support Democrats, agender gapthat seems likely to widen as the fall of Roe v. Wade turned the US into a country with abortion-rights states and abortion-ban states.The extent to which former President Donald Trump can siphon off support for Vice President Kamala Harris amongvoters of color, Latinos and Black men, in particular, could be consequential in states where close margins are expected.Rural voters generally side with Republicans, urban voters generally side with Democrats and whoever can get an edge in thesuburbswill win in November.But there is an even more important thing dividing voters, according to the longtime Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik, who was former President Bill Clinton’s political director and is known for incisivedeep-dive memos.The education gap grows“The biggest single, best predictor of how someone’s going to vote in American politics now is education level. That is now the new fault line in American politics,” Sosnik told David Chalian on the “CNN Political Briefing” podcast.Trump’s rise over the past three election cycles, Sosnik argued, “accelerated and completed this political realignment based on education that had been forming since the early ’70s, at the beginning of the decline in the middle class.”As the US transitions to a 21st century economy, there’s a rift between the people who attain education – “that’s become the basic Democratic Party,” he said, comparing them with people who feel left behind, “that group of voters is now the modern Republican Party base.”CNN Political BriefingThe Two Things That Will Decide The ElectionElection Day is just a little over three weeks away, and there’s still no clear leader in this race. With Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump still neck-and-neck, all eyes are on the battleground states. Doug Sosnik is a longtime Democratic strategist who’s known for his deep-dive political memos. He joins CNN Political Director David Chalian to share his insights on the current state of play and why he thinks the next 25 days are all about Harris’ ability to close the deal with voters who may not feel naturally aligned with her. He also explains why this election could yield the biggest gender gap in American political history.Oct 11, 2024 • 28 min...Apple PodcastsSpotifyTuneInRadio.comiHeart RadioPandoraAmazonRSSInequality growsThere’s data to back this up, as Sosnik has previouslywritten. In an August report on growing income inequality in the US, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis documented that for every dollar of wealth in a household headed by a college graduate, a household headed by a high school graduate has 22 cents. The figure rises to 30 cents for households headed by someone with some college, but no degree.Put another way, college graduates hold about three-quarters of the wealth in the US, but account for only about 40% of the population.There’s a direct correlation to politics. In 2020, according toCNN’s exit polls, voters with a college degree accounted for 41% of the electorate and they supported President Joe Biden 55% to Trump’s 43%. Trump got the support of about two-thirds of White voters without a college degree, but he lost White college-educated voters.Sorting states by education levelSosnik went a step further, arguing to Chalian that the seven or so battleground states that could be won by either Trump or Harris also tend to be right in the middle on education levels, “not skewing too much college-educated voters and not too much non-college. That’s the only reason they’re different than the rest of the country,” he said.TheLumina Foundationhas a report that uses census data to rank states by educational attainment, including post-high school certifications and associate degrees. It’s true that most of the battlegrounds – Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in the Rust Belt and Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona in the Sun Belt – all fall near the average. There is also one important exception. Nevada, which is a battleground state, has one of of the lowest levels of educational attainment in the US. While most of the states with the highest educational attainment are blue states in the northeast, Utah, a red state, is also near the top of the list.The real swing votersTo the extent that traditional swing voters are persuadable in this election, Sosnik argued they might be people like political independents or Nikki Haley Republicans.But there’s a second group of swing voters Sosnik argued is even more important. Those voters aren’t choosing between a candidate, but rather deciding whether to vote at all.For Trump, these are non-college-educated White voters in general, particularly men, who “if they vote, you know they’re going to vote for Trump,” he said. For Harris, they might be women who don’t normally participate in the process, but will this year, the first presidential election since the Supreme Court allowed some states to ban most or all abortions.Young voters, who are less reliable to cast ballots, also fall into this second type of swing voters, Sosnik said.Trump’s entire success in politics has been built around appealing not to independents, but to those who “aren’t traditional voters,” he said.The educational realignment could also change how we view presidential elections versus off-year midterms, he said.“Up until Trump, Democrats always did better in presidential years because infrequent voters were Democratic,” Sosnik argued. “Republicans always did better in off years because the high propensity voters were Republican. That’s completely flipped on its side now.”Listen to the podcast here. It also includes Sosnik’s current state of the race, where the vice president appears to have reached a plateau, but might yet break for Harris if she can “step up and close the deal” with swing voters.","Score: 0

cnn,Trump’s extreme vision for America hikes pressure on Harris,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/trump-extreme-vision-harris-pressure-analysis/index.html,"CNN—Donald Trumpis invoking a vision of an extreme new White House term that would transform America and rock the world.And Vice President Kamala Harris has only three weeks to avert it, as she struggles to restore momentum in a neck-and-neck race to Election Day.The Republican nominee is escalating the most toxic anti-immigrant rhetoric in modern US history, warning outsiderswith “bad genes”have “invaded” the country afterfalsely claimingthat Haitian migrants here legally were eating pets in Ohio. At a rally in Arizona on Sunday, Trump baselessly suggested that if Harris were elected, “the entire country will be turned into a migrant camp.” In Colorado two days earlier, he again vowed to “begin the largest deportation operation in the history of the United States,” promising, “We will close the border. We will stop the invasion of illegals into our country. We will defend our territory. We will not be conquered.”And he escalated his threats against political opponents this weekend, saying on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures”he could turn the militaryon “the enemy from within.” The ex-president, who incited violence to try to stay in power after the 2020 election, alsosaid at a rally Saturdaythat a heckler exercising the right to free speech should “get the hell knocked out of” her.In another preview of how he could use presidential power to serve his personal and political whims, Trump this weekend threatened to withhold federal disaster aid to Democratic-run California —even as he falsely accusesHarris and PresidentJoe Bidenof doing the same to hurricane-hit Republican districts. Trump also said CBS should lose its license because he faults its editorial choices over a Harris interview on “60 Minutes” that he declined to sit for. Trump’s allies, meanwhile, raised concerns about how a new administration might deal with big business bythreatening to cancel Deloitte’s federal contractsafter an employee apparently leaked Sen. JD Vance’s private messages critical of the former president.And new details are emerging of the former president’s genuflection to foreign tyrants like Vladimir Putin after the Kremlin confirmedTrump sent Covid-19 teststo a Russian authoritarian who is a sworn enemy of the United States during a pandemic he frequently downplayed.History suggests that Trump doesn’t always act on everything he says. But his past behavior suggests his threats should be taken seriously.And a Supreme Courtruling granting presidentssubstantial immunity suggests few impediments to imperial executive power.Former President Barack Obama speaks at a campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris at the University of Pittsburgh on October 10, 2024.Jeff Swensen/Getty ImagesRelated articleObama’s reemergence on the campaign trail for Harris comes as he recognizes his own legacy is at stakeTrump’s deepening extremism is increasing already massive pressure on Harris. And a phalanx of senior Democratic leaders — including former Presidents Bill Clinton andBarack Obama— are pleading with voters in swing states, especially the Black and Latino voters Harris needs, not to let Trump return.The vice president sharpened her attacks on Trump on Sunday during a rally in North Carolina, criticizing him for failing to release his medical records (just afterissuing her own medical report) and for refusing to meet her in a second debate and to be interviewed by “60 Minutes.”“He’s not being transparent with the voters. … It makes you wonder, why does his staff want him to hide away? One must question, are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable?” she asked.Supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris listen to her speak during a rally at Ripon College, in Wisconsin, on October 3.Jim Vondruska/Getty ImagesGrowing fears among DemocratsDread is growing among Democrats that the euphoria over Harris’ entry into the race in July, her successful convention in August and her debate performance the following month have not translated yet into a decisive lead over Trump.There’s no clear leader in the latest CNN average of national polls, which includes neck-and-neck surveys by CBS, ABC and NBC released Sunday. Even if Harris were leading in national surveys, there are fears that, like Hillary Clinton before her, she could win the popular vote but fall short in the Electoral College.The tightly balanced race three weeks out shows that while he’s an aberration from traditional presidential candidates, Trump is offering something millions of Americans want. Republicans argue that Harris-Biden policies caused a spike in inflation the White House tried for months to downplay. Trump cites the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan to argue the current White House is seen as weak around the world. And after failing to tackle the policy or political ramifications of immigration earlier in Biden’s term, Democrats offered Trump a huge opening on a critical issue.Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris walks to board Air Force Two as she departs for New York, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on October 7, 2024.Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersRelated articleDemocrats grow anxious as Election Day nearsThe close contestalso suggests that despite Trump’s unapologetic extremism, Democrats have failed for the third election in a row to produce a candidate and a message that can give them any reassurance about the election result. While liberals and moderates might be horrified by the strongman leadership Trump proposes, he’s winning on what voters consistently say is the top election issue: the economy. In the ABC News/Ipsos poll, for example, 59% say it’s getting worse, even though the job market is robust, inflation is far from its highs and interest rates are easing.With the nation in such a sour mood, Harris’ incumbency as vice president is a liability. And her failure,in a recent interviewwith ABC’s “The View,” to come up with even one thing she would have done differently from Biden is a misstep Trump will exploit all the way to Election Day. Harris has spelled out policies to help people buy and rent homes, to ease the cost of health care and to revive a bipartisan border bill that Trump killed. But it’s still often hard in her interviews to spot a powerful rationale for her campaign. Trump’s vow to deport migrants, torch US trade competitors with tariffs and fix a world spinning out of control looks forceful by comparison, even if extreme.Video Ad Feedback'Bad news for Democrats': Data reporter shows where GOP is making big gains04:29- Source:CNNStill, Democrats looking for reassurance might note that Trump tops out at 48% or below in most polls. This implies that his typical ceiling in national elections remains in place, while Harris may still have room to grow. In the NBC News poll, 10% of voters said they might change their minds. And what the network called a “sliver” were still unclaimed. In states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and Georgia, even late shifts in support could be decisive.The eventual makeup of the electorate will also be crucial. Will Harris’ focus on abortion rights, for instance, stir higher-than-expected turnout from women voters that could confound pollsters’ assumptions? Can she stem her opponent’s advances among Black male and Hispanic voters? Or will Trump tap a new pool of support among Americans who agree with him on many issues but rarely vote?What Harris needs to doVice President Kamala Harris speaks to the press before boarding Air Force Two at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on October 12, 2024.Brendan Smialowski/Pool/AFP/Getty ImagesDemocratic strategist Doug Sosnik believes the election is a 50-50 race and that Harris plateaued in the last 10 days as Trump gained some ground. He told CNN Political Director David Chalian on the“CNN Political Briefing”podcast that the presidency may depend on which candidate finally brands themself as a change agent.Trump’s campaign released a memo Sunday claiming that question had already been answered. “She can’t convince the voters that she is ‘the change agent’ in the race, that she will be better on the economy, inflation, immigration, crime, or improving people’s financial situation,” the memo said. “The bottom line is that voters say President Trump will do a better job.”But Sosnik said the campaign is “really going to boil down to Harris and whether she can stand up to the pressure and the scrutiny and whether she can create a permission structure for people who don’t want to vote for Trump but are concerned about Harris.” He warned: “They don’t feel like she has given them enough reason to vote for her … she is not doing that right now.”Harris’ task is complicated by the lack of opportunities to take on Trump directly. The former president, who has spent weeks lambasting her for avoiding the press, rarely strays from his comfort zone of conservative media and Fox News, where he enjoys adulation rather than cross-examination. He is dodging a second presidential debate against Harris and pulled out of a “60 Minutes” interview before critiquing the vice president’s performance on the show. And whereas in 2016, when Trump’s rallies were hard to escape on cable television, the performances now rarely get end-to-end coverage outside conservative media, meaning that many voters may not appreciate his extreme and increasingly disjointed antics.Obama seemed baffled during a campaign appearance for Harris in Pennsylvania last week at his predecessor’s enduring appeal among millions of voters. “There is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anyone but himself,” Obama said. “Donald Trump sees power as nothing more than a means to an end.”But Trump — despite his two impeachments, his criminal conviction, and his attempt to destroy democracy to stay in power — is within reach of the presidency again with a more radical agenda than before.Sen. Chris Murphy has been sounding the alarm in recent days with a string of increasingly frantic posts on X. Reacting to Trump’s description of undocumented migrants last week as “rapists” and the “worst criminals in the world,” Murphy wrote that such rhetoric portends “a dystopian country” with open-air prison camps and the rule of law suspended. “We cannot let this happen. His vision of America is not America,” the Connecticut Democrat added.His post underscored what Harris represents for those who fear the very real prospect of Trump’s return.","Score: -1

cnn,How hurricane season is affecting the way Americans follow the Trump-Harris race,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/breakthrough-polling-projects-hurricanes-trump-harris/index.html,"CNN—With the election less than a month away, the public’s attention has shifted to the candidates’ responses to hurricane season,according to The Breakthrough, a CNN polling project that tracks what average Americans are actually hearing, reading and seeing about the presidential nominees throughout the campaign. FormerPresident Donald Trump’s campaign also faced renewed focus on his legal troubles in the wake of a new filing by federal prosecutors, the survey finds.In the wake ofHurricane Helene, which has killed more than 230 people across the southeastern United States, “hurricane” was the word most frequently mentioned when respondents were asked what they’d heard about Trump. It was the second-most frequent word mentioned when they were asked about Vice President Kamala Harris, second only to “campaign.” The poll, conducted by SSRS and Verasight on behalf of a research team from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, was fielded from October 4-7, beforeHurricane Miltonmade landfall in Florida on Wednesday night.Democrats and Republicans were about equally likely to mention the hurricane when talking about Harris – although their perspectives on her response often differed sharply.Harris “was working with FEMA on providing assistance and recovery for the areas affected by Hurricane Helene,” one Democratic respondent wrote, while another credited her with having done “a great job of consoling hurricane victims in Georgia.”By contrast, a Republican respondent wrote about hearing that Harris “is only paying $750 to those whose homes are being devastated in the hurricanes, yet sending billions upon billions of dollars to Ukraine and Israel.” The $750 is an apparent reference to a payment program at the Federal Emergency Management Agencythat has been mischaracterized by Trump and othersas the only assistance FEMA is providing.Republicans were far likelier than Democrats to mention the hurricane in conjunction with Trump. When Democrats were asked what they’d recently heard about the GOP presidential nominee, they were more likely than Republicans to mention his response to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, or simply use the word “lie.”In the latest set of data, Americans also mentioned the October 5 rally Trump held in Butler, Pennsylvania – the site of the first assassination attempt against him this summer. And they referenced two other names in conjunction with him: Elon Musk, whoappeared onstage with Trump in Butler, and Jack Smith, the special counsel whoserecently unsealed legal brieflaid out the government’s sweeping case against the former president for his effort to overturn the 2020 election.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgRoughly 14% of respondents who’d heard something about Trump referenced words related to his legal issues, up from 7% in the previous wave of data and the highest share to do so since early September, when the sentencing in his New York criminal case was delayed until after the 2024 election.Asked about Harris, 8% of respondents who’d heard something about her mentioned words relating to endorsements – in this case, largely a reference to Republican former Vice President Dick Cheney, who announced his support of her last month, and his daughter Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman whorecently appeared with Harrison the campaign trail. Harris also previously saw bursts of attention after endorsements from Oprah Winfrey and Taylor Swift.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgThe sentiment behind the words Americans used to describe what they’d heard about Harris remained modestly more positive than the words they used to describe the news about Trump. This doesn’t mean that they expressed warmer feelings about Harris personally but that what they said about her tended to be framed in relatively positive terms and tone.

cnn,Harris’ border visit and economy speech capture attention as warning signs emerge for campaign,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/06/politics/breakthrough-polling-project-harris-lie/index.html,"CNN—Kamala Harris’visit to the borderandspeechoutlining her economic vision captured the attention of a sizable share of Americans as September came to a close, according to new findings fromThe Breakthrough, a polling project that tracks how the public is following election news. But some emerging trends in the data hint at warning signs for the vice president’s campaign.The share of Americans hearing anything at all about Harris has dropped each week since her presidential debate with former PresidentDonald Trumpin early September, and during that same time, the tone Americans use in describing what they’ve heard about her has grown more negative, reaching the lowest point of her campaign in the latest results.Looking at what people say they have heard, read or seen about Harris, “lie” has emerged as a persistent top word that some Americans associate with her. In the latest data, it was the fourth-most mentioned word after “border,” “polls” and “campaign.” It ranked sixth in the previous week’s data and second the week of theABC News presidential debate, after ranking no higher than 12th in earlier rounds of the survey and no higher than 20th prior to the Democratic convention in August.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgThe survey, conducted September 27-30 by SSRS and Verasight for research teams from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, measures what Americans say they have recently heard, read or seen about Harris and Trump.The share of Americans mentioning words such as “lie” or “liar” when asked what they’ve heard about Harris remains quite small — just 6% in the latest data, compared with 15% who mentioned something related to immigration, for example — but it has grown over time, rising from 3% or less prior to the Democratic convention to peak at 9% shortly after the debate.“Kamala says nothing,” wrote one respondent included in the latest survey. “She uses a bunch of words that make no sense. She says she will close the border, but that is a lie to get elected. Everything she promises are lies.”Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a rally at the Dort Financial Center in Flint, Mich., Friday, Oct. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)Mark Schiefelbein/APRelated articleHarris tries to turn the tables on Trump by embracing the border as a key issueThe broader focus on immigration (mentioned by 15% in relation to Harris) and the economy (mentioned by 13%) in the latest data marks a notable shift in responses about Harris, following her campaign’s efforts to focus attention on the two topics with a visit to the southern border in Arizona and an economic policy speech in Pittsburgh. It marks the first time in the survey that multiple policy-related topics have landed in the top five for Harris, and the most recent data saw by far the most mentions for immigration-related words in relation to her campaign since she entered the race in late July.“I have watched her speeches and appreciated her articulate explanation of her policies and positions on various things,” another respondent wrote. “Her concern for all and ability to concretely point to solutions to problems is a sharp contrast to Donald Trump.”On Trump’s side, theassassination attemptsagainst him remain prominent in the public’s attention, while immigration has faded a bit andhis meeting last monthwith Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky garnered attention.“He met with Zelensky and was not very enthusiastic about helping Ukraine,” one respondent wrote.Responses calling the former president a liar are also persistently near the top of his list. About 8% in the latest data use the word “lie” or “liar” in relation to Trump. That figure has frequently been in the high single digits as a share of topics about Trump since the start of the survey in June, dipping below that at times, including around the first assassination attempt against the former president and the Republican National Convention.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgAlthough responses about Harris are generally still less negative in tone than those about Trump, there has been a notable decline in overall sentiment in the Harris responses, while Trump’s numbers have rebounded slightly following a post-debate drop. For Harris, the negative shift is apparent across parties, with sentiments expressed by Democrats, Republicans and independents all tilting slightly more negative in the new data than in the week prior. For Trump, though, sentiment has held steady among Republicans, while shifting slightly less negative than the previous survey among independents and Democrats.The latest poll found that just under two-thirds of Americans (64%) reported seeing, reading or hearing something about Harris, compared with 68% who said the same about Trump. It marks the fourth straight week in which more people reported hearing about Trump than they did about Harris, and it’s a notable drop from the previous week in the shares saying they’d heard about each candidate (Trump down 7 points, Harris down 5).The overall level of attention to the presidential candidates now is lower than it was at this point in previous cycles, though that may be a side effect of debate timing. In 2020, for example, more than 8 in 10 Americans reported having heard news about Trump and Joe Biden in the same week of that campaign, but there was a presidential debate held on September 29. In 2016, there was a mid-September dip in attention ahead of that year’s first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton, held on September 26.“It has been relatively quiet this week,” one respondent to the latest survey wrote when asked about Trump. “I haven’t heard of anything.”CNN’s Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report.","Score: 0

cnn,CNN Instant Poll: No clear winner in VP debate between Tim Walz and JD Vance,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/politics/election-poll-walz-vance-debate/index.html,"CNN—Registered voters who watchedTuesday’s debate between vice presidential nomineesTim Walz and JD Vance were closely divided over which candidate did the better job, according to aCNN instant poll of debate watchers conducted by SSRS, and the event left viewers with more positive views of both candidates than they held pre-debate.Among debate watchers, Walz remains the candidate who’s seen more positively and as more in touch with their needs and vision for the country. Vance, who suffers from more of an image deficit among both viewers and the public at large, boosted his standing among the debate audience, outperforming expectations and gaining ground on the share who perceive him as qualified. He was also narrowly seen as doing a better job than Walz of defending his running mate. Both men, the poll finds, are viewed by a majority of debate watchers as qualified to assume the presidency if needed. And practically none of the voters who tuned in saw the debate as a reason to change their votes.Viewers in the spin room watch the CBS News vice presidential debate on October 1 in New York.Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APRelated article36 key lines to explain the Vance-Walz vice presidential debateFollowing the debate, 51% of viewers said that Vance did the better job, with 49% picking Walz. In a survey conducted of the same voters prior to the debate, Walz held the advantage as the candidate they expected to perform more strongly, 54% to 45%.The closely divided opinions about the outcome of Tuesday’s debate stand in sharp contrast to the more decisive audience reaction following this year’s top-of-the-ticket debates. In June,two-thirds of debate watchersthought that formerPresident Donald TrumpoutperformedPresident Joe Biden, while a 63% majority who tuned in to the September debate between Trump andKamala Harrissaid thatthe vice president did the better job.Views of the vice presidential hopefuls split largely along pre-established political lines Tuesday night: 90% of debate watchers who support Trump’s candidacy said that Vance did the better job, while a slightly narrower 82% of the Harris supporters who tuned in saw Walz as the winner.The poll’s results reflect opinions of the debate only among those voters who tuned in and aren’t representative of the views of the full voting public. Debate watchers in the poll were 3 percentage points likelier to be Democratic-aligned than Republican-aligned, making for an audience that was about 5 points more Democratic-leaning than all registered voters nationally. That’s a difference from the audience for the two presidential debates this year, both of which were slightly more GOP-leaning than the potential American electorate overall. What voters who don’t tune in hear about an event in the following days can often be as impactful as immediate views of the event itself.Following the debate, 59% of debate watchers said they had a favorable view of Walz, with just 22% viewing him unfavorably – an improvement from his already positive numbers among the same voters pre-debate (46% favorable, 32% unfavorable). Debate watchers came away from the debate with roughly neutral views of Vance: 41% rated him favorably and 44% unfavorably. That’s also an improvement from their image of Vance pre-debate, when his ratings among this group were deeply underwater (30% favorable, 52% unfavorable).Among debate watchers, Walz boosted his favorability far more among women than men, while Vance’s gains were about the same among voters of both genders. About 1 in 5 Trump supporters (21%) who tuned in now say they have a favorable view of Walz, while Vance’s favorability rating with Harris’ supporters remains at just 8%.Ina CNN poll of all Americans taken prior to the debate, views of Walz were narrowly above water, with 36% of voters viewing him favorably, 32% unfavorably, and a sizable 33% saying they hadn’t heard of him or had no opinion of him. By contrast, views of Vance tilted negative, with 30% of registered voters rating him favorably, 42% unfavorably, and 27% offering no opinion.A 65% majority of debate watchers now say Walz is qualified to serve as president if necessary, with 58% saying the same of Vance. Prior to the debate, 62% of the same voters thought Walz was qualified to assume the presidency if needed and 50% that Vance was qualified to do so.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance attend a debate hosted by CBS News in New York on Tuesday.Mike Segar/ReutersRelated articleFact-checking the CBS News vice presidential debate between Vance and WalzDebate watchers said, 48% to 35%, that Walz is more in touch than Vance with the needs and problems of people like them, and by a similar margin, 48% to 39%, that Walz, rather than Vance, more closely shares their vision for America. The share of viewers who said that both vice presidential hopefuls are in touch with their problems is twice as large as the share who said that neither is, 12% to 6% – a level of positivity unusual in this year’s election cycle.There’s a significant gender gap among viewers over which candidate more closely shares their vision for America: Among female voters, Walz has the clear advantage, with half saying he does compared with the 36% who see Vance’s vision as closer to theirs. Male voters split more evenly, 47% Walz to 43% Vance.Viewers said by a narrow margin, 37% to 33%, that Vance did a better job than Walz in defending his running mate, with 27% saying that each candidate did an equally good job, and 3% that neither did. Seven in 10 Trump supporters said Vance did the better job defending his running mate, while 57% of Harris backers said Walz did best on that.A negligible 1% of voters who tuned into the debate said it had changed their mind about whom to vote for, with Harris and Trump supporters equally unlikely to view the event as decisive.The CNN poll was conducted by text message with 574 registered US voters who said they watched the debate Tuesday, and the poll findings are representative of the views of debate watchers only. Respondents were recruited to participate before the debate and were selected via a survey of members of the SSRS Opinion Panel, a nationally representative panel recruited using probability-based sampling techniques.

cnn,What’s the latest news about the Trump-Harris race? It depends on who you ask,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/29/politics/breakthrough-polling-project-trump-harris-springfield/index.html,"CNN—Over the past week, Americans were more likely to hear news about formerPresident Donald Trumpthan about Vice President Kamala Harris,according to The Breakthrough, a CNN polling project that tracks what average Americans are actually hearing, reading and seeing about the presidential candidates throughout the campaign.But after a spate of high-profile news that drew attention largely across the political spectrum — including the presidential debate and thefirst assassination attemptagainst Trump — this week’s data shows a significant divergence between what Democrats and Republicans each recalled hearing about the GOP nominee. Republicans focused more on theassassination attemptagainst the former president in Florida earlier this month, while Democrats continued to say they were hearing more abouthis baseless claimsabout Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.In the most recent survey — conducted September 20-23 by SSRS and Verasight on behalf of a research team from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, three-quarters of Americans said they’d consumed at least some news about Trump, slightly outpacing the 69% who said the same about Harris. That’s a shift from late August and early September, when roughly equal shares recalled hearing news about each of the candidates.Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to mention the word “assassination” and other phrases surrounding the attempt on Trump’s life, such as references to the golf course where the attempt took place.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.org“Donald Trump has been out on the campaign trail and it’s getting dangerous for him. He had a second attempt on his life recently at a golf course,” one respondent wrote.Democrats were more likely to still focus on theSeptember presidential debate, bringing up words like “lie” and references to Trump falsely claiming that migrants in Ohio were eating pets. “He continues to peddle the Springfield story about Haitian immigrants eating local pets,” wrote another respondent. “He is using anti-Semitic tropes in his speeches. He continues to spread mistruths about his performance in the debate.”Political independents mentioned both sets of topics, the survey found, and Americans across the aisle were about equally likely to mention words pointing more broadly to the presidential race, such as “campaign” or “election.”Some of the disparity between Democrats and Republicans may stem from a difference in the media sources consumed. But it may also reflect differences in the news stories that resonate more with each group — as well the way partisans on each side are likely to describe those stories when asked, which often reflects their own political sentiments.Asked what they’d seen, read or heard about Harris, meanwhile, Americans’ responses included the word “debate” — a reference both to her performance in her first presidential debate and her stated willingness for a rematch against Trump — as well asher interview with Oprah Winfrey.Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.orgThe sentiment behind the words Americans used to describe what they’d heard about Harris remained more positive than the words they used to describe the news about Trump. This doesn’t mean that they expressed warmer feelings about her personally but that what they said about her tended to be framed in relatively positive terms and tone.However, the gap in sentiments about the two candidates was significantly smaller than it was last week in the wake of the debate. The tone of responses relating to Harris were slightly more negative than positive, bringing her sentiment number roughly in line with where it was prior to the debate, while Trump’s remained in negative territory.","Score: 0

Gov.Mark Robinsontrailing his Democratic opponent by a wide margin in the state’s gubernatorial race.Both places could be key to either Harris or Trump winning the270 electoral votesneeded to win the presidency. Trump faces limited paths to victory should he fail to hold North Carolina – the state where he earned his slimmest margin of victory in 2020 – and a win inNebraska’s 2nd Districtwould open up a path for Harris through the northern “blue wall” states even if she fails to carry any of the Sun Belt battlegrounds.In North Carolina, Harris and Trump stand at 48% each among likely voters. In Nebraska’s 2nd District, theso-called blue dotencompassing Omaha, Harris has 53% to Trump’s 42%, the poll finds.North Carolina, which narrowly supported Barack Obama in 2008 and has gone red in the past three presidential elections, is a state Democrats hope to make competitive again this year. Nebraska, meanwhile, is one of two states, along with Maine, that splits its Electoral College votes – awarding two to the statewide winner, with the other three awarded separately to the winner of each of the state’s congressional districts.Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald TrumpGetty ImagesRelated articleCNN Poll: Harris and Trump locked in exceedingly close presidential raceThe Cornhusker State has long been a Republican presidential stronghold, but its 2nd District has twice in recent history awarded its vote to the Democratic nominee, breaking for Obama in 2008 and forJoe Bidenin 2020.The vast majority of North Carolina voters say they’ve made up their minds, and roughly three-quarters of registered voters supporting each of the major candidates say they’re extremely motivated to vote. More than 7 in 10 among both Harris and Trump backers say their choice is a mark of support for their chosen candidate, not just a vote against their opponent. But 12% of likely voters in the state say they could still change their minds about the candidate they’re supporting – more than enough to make a difference in a deadlocked race.Trump currently leads Harris among White likely voters in North Carolina, 58% to 39%, a narrower margin than his edge over Biden among White voters who turned out in the 2020 election,according to CNN exit polls. White likely voters with college degrees currently favor Harris over Trump by a wide margin, which would mark a shift from a narrow divide among this group four years ago.Harris leads Trump, 79% to 11%, among Black likely voters, a group that in 2020 made up roughly one-quarter of the state’s electorate. While Harris’ standing among Black likely voters in the poll is currently weaker than the share Biden ended up winning in 2020, that does not reflect significantly increased support for Trump – rather, about one-tenth of Black likely voters currently say they’re supporting a third-party candidate or are unsure of their choice.Trump addresses supporters at a campaign rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, on September 21, 2024.Brian Snyder/ReutersMale voters in North Carolina break narrowly toward Trump (51% to 45%) with Harris holding a slight advantage among female voters (50% to 46%), but the gender gap is smaller than that seen in CNN’s most recent national survey.Photo Illustration by CNNRelated article‘I’m a black NAZI!’: NC GOP nominee for governor made dozens of disturbing comments on porn forumDown ballot, Harris is significantly outperformed by DemocratJosh Stein, who leads Robinson, the lieutenant governor, 53% to 36%, among likely voters in the North Carolina governor’s race.Robinson, who has faced a wave of scandal after CNN uncovered inflammatory comments he madeon a porn website, is viewed unfavorably by a majority of the state’s likely voters (27% view him favorably, 53% unfavorably, 20% have no opinion). Stein, the North Carolina attorney general, is lesser known but viewed far more positively (40% favorable, 23% unfavorable, 36% no opinion).

Overall, 72% of them support him, while 14% say they will vote for Stein and 12% that they would vote for neither of them. Stein, by contrast, has broadly consolidated support among Democratic-aligned likely voters, 95% of whom support him.In Nebraska’s 2nd District, the poll finds, Harris’ broad lead includes a near-universal 96% among Democratic likely voters, with her numbers buoyed by the 61% support she holds among the district’s independent likely voters, as well as 10% among Republican likely voters.

An 86% majority of Democratic likely voters and 69% of independent likely voters favor keeping the current system, while 69% of GOP likely voters say they’d rather move to a winner-take-all system in the state.Harris is running ahead of the Democratic nominee in the race to represent Nebraska’s 2nd District in Congress, with Democrat Tony Vargas holding a narrow advantage over incumbent Republican Rep.

They’re evenly split on whether Harris or Trump more closely shares their view on what the country’s biggest problems are, and closely divided on which candidate would bring needed change (44% Trump, 42% Harris) or has clear policy plans to solve the country’s problems (42% Trump, 39% Harris).A view of voting booths at a polling station for the New York U.S. Presidential Primary election in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, U.S., April 2, 2024.

As in other battleground states, the economy is cited as the top issue in the presidential race by a plurality of voters.In Nebraska’s 2nd District, Trump sees more erosion on the issues on which he’s traditionally posted his strongest numbers: likely voters there are closely split between him and Harris on both the economy and immigration, and give Harris the lead on handling crime and safety (by 6 points), democracy (by 14 points) and abortion and reproductive rights (by 21 points).Nearly six in 10 likely voters in the district call Trump too extreme (57%), and about half (51%) say he’s extreme enough to pose a threat.

But just 41% in North Carolina say they’re very confident, rising to a 59% majority in Nebraska’s 2nd District.The Nebraska seat also sees a far smaller partisan divide in election confidence: while Harris supporters there are 33 points more likely than Trump supporters to express high confidence in their state’s election system, that expands to a 52-point gap between each candidate’s supporters in North Carolina.Interviews were conducted September 20-25, 2024, online and by telephone with registered voters, including 931 voters in North Carolina and 749 in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.

cnn,"Harris still lags behind Biden’s 2020 margins among Black voters, but latest CNN poll suggests she has room to grow support",https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/26/politics/black-voters-poll-harris-trump/index.html,"CNN—KamalaHarris leadsDonald Trumpby a wide margin among Black likely voters, according to anew CNN poll conducted by SSRS, but still falls short ofJoe Biden’s winning 2020 margins with this group. Yet the poll suggests that Black likely voters currently supporting Trump or third-party candidates are not as locked into their choices as those Black likely voters who back the vice president.CNN’s latest poll finds Harris leading Trump by 63 points among Black likely voters, 79% to 16%. That’s a considerable improvement over Biden’s 46-point advantage over Trump among registered voters in CNN’s June poll, which was its last with the president at the top of the ticket. But that advantage falls short of the Biden-Harris campaign’s 75-point margin among Black voters, according toexit polls from 2020.Since Harris’ entrance into the race, enthusiasm among Black voters about the election appears to have grown. In the latest poll, 79% of Black registered voters say they would definitely vote, up from 68% in the June poll. For voters overall, that stood at 82% in the latest poll, about the same as in June. Black voters now are just as likely as other voters to say it is extremely important that they, personally, vote (both at 63%), while in June, Black registered voters were less likely to say the same (57% among Black voters, 66% overall).Harris’ improvement over Biden’s margins from earlier this year comes as the poll finds broad support for her from the 40% of Black likely voters who view Biden’s presidency as a failure – Harris leads Trump 65% to 31% among these voters.The poll suggests Trump’s improvements among Black voters relative to 2020 are driven largely by Black voters under the age of 60. Harris leads among Black voters aged 60 and over by 87 points, almost identical to Biden’s 85-point margin in 2020, according to exit polls for the same group. This shrinks to a 55-point lead for Harris among Black voters younger than 60 (Biden won this group by 71 points in 2020, according to exit polls). Trump performs best among Black likely voters younger than 40, with 22% support.President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign rally at Girard College on May 29, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/FileStill, CNN’s poll suggests that Harris has the potential to improve her margins. Her supporters are broadly locked in and unlikely to shift in the race – 92% of Black likely voters who support Harris say their minds are already made up. But among those backing other candidates, a third say they may yet change their mind.Harris is also generally viewed more favorably among Black registered voters compared with registered voters overall, even after accounting for Black voters’ overwhelming Democratic lean. Nearly 8 in 10 Black voters view Harris favorably, and Black Democrats view Harris slightly more positively than others in the party, while Black voters outside the Democratic Party offer far more positive views of her than do independents or Republicans of other races.Black voters who don’t consider themselves Democrats are more likely than non-Democrats of other racial backgrounds to say that Harris has improved their view of the Democratic Party; that they would be proud or excited if she wins the election; and that her views are generally mainstream, with Black Democratic voters offering similar or modestly more positive views than others in their party. Among non-Democrats, Black voters also rate Harris as more aligned with their vision of a president than do other voters across all the attributes tested in the poll, including temperament, ability to understand the problems of people like themselves and leadership skills.That carries over to views of Trump too. Non-Democratic Black voters are more likely to view Trump’s presidency as a failure than other voters who share their partisan perspective and are less likely to trust Trump over Harris on handling each of the issues tested in the poll, including the economy and immigration.While Black likely voters are largely focused on the same issues as the broader electorate, the CNN polling does find some differences among Democrats. Black likely voters are just as likely as all other groups to consider the economy their top issue (41%). Democratic Black likely voters, however, are twice as likely as Democratic likely voters overall to consider the economy their top issue (42%, compared with 19%). Democratic Black likely voters are also less apt than Democratic likely voters overall to say that protecting democracy or abortion and reproductive rights are their top issue.When asked which economic issue is most important to them, Black voters across the political spectrum are generally aligned with the overall electorate and put inflation at the top of the list. But Black likely voters are more likely than other voters to name jobs and wages as the top economic issue and less likely to say federal spending.Nearly 9 in 10 Black registered voters say the political system in the United States is in need of a major overhaul or major reforms, and a large majority (85%) say that the federal government does not do enough for Black Americans. Roughly half of Black voters (47%) say that the federal government does both too much for White Americans and too little for Black Americans. Still, Black registered voters are more likely than the broader electorate to say that they are satisfied with the influence people like themselves have on the political process (52%, compared with 38% overall).The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS online and by telephone September 19-22, 2024, among 2,074 registered voters nationwide drawn from a probability-based panel. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election. The survey included an oversample of Black registered voters to reach a total of 579; this group has been weighted to its proper size within the population for all survey results. Results for the full sample of registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.0 percentage points; it is the same among likely voters and larger for subgroups. Results among Black registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 7.8 percentage points; among Black likely voters, it is plus or minus 7.7 percentage points.CNN’s Jennifer Agiesta and Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report.","Score: 0

cnn,Trump wants to renegotiate his own trade deal with Mexico and Canada,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/usmca-trump-renegotiate/index.html,"WashingtonCNN—Former President Donald Trump is once again pledging to save American manufacturing and bring back jobs by rewriting a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.But this time, instead of replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as NAFTA, which he has often described as the “worst trade deal ever made,” he wants to renegotiate his own trade deal.Trump signed onto theUS-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, in 2018. It took effect in January 2020 and replaced NAFTA.In 2018, Trumpsaidthe USMCA would be “the most modern, up-to-date, and balanced trade agreement in the history of our country, with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed.”But now, he thinks it can be improved.“Upon taking office, I will formally notify Mexico and Canada of my intention to invoke the six-year renegotiation provision of the USMCA that I put in,” Trump said last week during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.The USMCA includes a clause that requires a review by the three signatory countries at the six-year anniversary.When asked by Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo in an interview that aired Sunday about his plan to renegotiate the USMCA, Trump said it would not undermine the deal he put together.“I want to make it a much better deal. I want to take advantage, now, of the car industry,” he said.Harris also wants to review the USMCAVice President Kamala Harris has also said she would use the USMCA review process.Harris, who is now the Democratic presidential nominee, was one of 10 US senators who voted against USMCA at the time.“I knew it was not sufficient to protect our country and its workers,” she said in a statement last week.Following the Senate vote in 2020, Harrissaidshe was concerned the USMCA’s environmental provisions did not go far enough to address climate change.Here’s what’s in the USMCAMuch of USMCAsimply updated the 25-year-old NAFTA.One of the biggest changes was a new incentive to build cars and trucks in North America. USMCA requires 75% of a vehicle’s parts to be made in one of the three countries – up from the previous 62.5% rule – in order to remain free from tariffs when moving across borders.It also required more vehicle parts to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour.The trade deal created sweeping new benefits for the technology sector, in a chapter on digital trade that wasn’t part of the original NAFTA.Strong labor rules and environmental protections were also included.","Score: 0

cnn,Trump campaign tries to push immigration issue over Bill Clinton’s comments on Laken Riley,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/bill-clinton-laken-riley-campaign/index.html,"CNN—Former President Donald Trump’s campaign is highlighting former President Bill Clinton’s comment Sunday that Georgia nursing student Laken Riley’s death “probably wouldn’t have happened” if migrants, including her alleged killer, had “all been properly vetted.”Clinton’s remark came as he lambasted Trump for scuttling a bipartisan border security bill earlier this year. The bill sputtered in January when Trump’s opposition to it led Republican support to erode. Vice President Kamala Harris, who islooking to blunt Trump’s attacks on immigration, has vowed to revive that bill and sign it into law if she wins the White House.Clinton said the bill would have led to “total vetting before people got in” at the US-Mexico border.“Now, Trump killed the bill,” he said.He then pointed to Riley, a 22-year-old Augusta University nursing student who was killed while jogging in February. The suspect,Jose Antonio Ibarra, an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela, was arrested in 2022 after entering the United States illegally, according to a statement from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but was released for further processing.“You got a case in Georgia not very long ago – didn’t you, they made an ad about it – a young woman who had been killed by an immigrant. Yeah, well, if they’d all been properly vetted that probably wouldn’t have happened,” Clinton said. “But if they are all properly vetted, that doesn’t happen, and America is not having enough babies to keep our population up, so we need immigrants that have been vetted to do work.”But Trump’s campaign cast Clinton’s comments as an indictment of President Joe Biden and Harris’ handling of border security, noting that Riley’s alleged killer had entered the United States in 2022, long before that bill had been drafted.“Kamala Harris claimed the border was ‘secure’ just days after Laken Riley’s illegal immigrant killer Jose Ibarra crossed into the nation. Ibarra was caught at the border and then released into the country by Kamala Harris,” Trump’s campaign said in a statement. “President Trump will secure the border and stop catch-and-release. This is why he was just endorsed by the Border Patrol Union.”The Trump War Roomaccount on X posteda video of Clinton’s remarks on Monday, which the Harris campaign said was “deceptively edited.”“Clinton said Trump killed a bipartisan border security bill that VP Harris supported which would strengthen vetting for people entering the country,” said Ian Sams, a spokesman for the campaign,in a separate post on X.The back-and-forth demonstrated how Democrats have tried to address what polls have shown is among Trump’s most potent issues – and how the former president has pushed back, accusing Biden and Harris of taking action far too late and only as the presidential election loomed.Riley’s killing and the suspect’s immigration status renewed debate on the country’s immigration policies at the highest level. Biden held up a pin with Riley’s name on it atthe State of the Union addressin March.Ibarra was indicted in May on charges of murder and aggravated assault with intent to rape, as well as for an earlier incident in which he allegedly peeped into the window of a student. He has pleaded not guilty in the case.","Score: 0

Last week,former President Barack Obamadelivered a stark warning to Black men, saying it’s “not acceptable” to sit out this election and suggesting they might be reluctant to vote for Harris because she’s a woman.BLOC organizer, Devonta Johnson, shares a laugh with fellow canvassers as they set out to knock on doors in Milwaukee's Sixth Ward.Jacqueline Kalil/CNNRelated articleMilwaukee’s Black voters expose cracks in Democratic foundation for HarrisThe proposal aims to provide Black men “with the tools to achieve financial freedom, lower costs to better provide for themselves and their families, and protect their rights,” according to a release by the campaign.Part of the proposal includes providing one million loans that are fully forgivable up to $20,000 to Black entrepreneurs and others to start a business. According to the campaign, the loans would be provided through a new partnership between the Small Business Administration and some lenders and banks.Harris is also calling for creating and investing in programs that help expand pathways for job opportunities for Black men, including promoting apprenticeships, strengthening the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and investing in more Black male teachers. On the campaign trail, Harris has said she will cut college degree requirements for certain federal jobs if elected president.The plan will also support a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets and a National Health Equity Initiativethat focuses on addressing health challenges that disproportionately impact Black men. Another component includes legalizing recreational marijuana and creating opportunities for Black Americans to succeed in the industry. The vice president has often reiterated that she believes marijuana should legalized in the US.The campaign will tout the agenda during several upcoming events, including “Black Men Huddle Up” events, an Economic Freedom Talk series and paid media outreach as they try to draw a contrast with former President Donald Trump.“Donald Trump’s outreach is gold sneakers, T shirts of mug shots and insults and putting other communities down. The Vice President is actually speaking to what Black men can achieve under her presidency. We think that’s a stark point of contrast, and one that is important to talk about,” Harris-Walz campaign communications Director Michael Tyler said in a statement.Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris walks to board Air Force Two as she departs for New York, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on October 7, 2024.Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersRelated articleDemocrats grow anxious as Election Day nearsAs CNN has reported, Harris had been focused on turning out Black men even before she took over as the Democratic nominee, trying to get the enthusiasm there for Biden when he was still running for reelection.“The concern is that the couch is going to win,” one person close to the Harris teampreviously told CNN. “We need to make sure that Black men, Hispanic men, don’t sit on the couch. Because if they don’t vote at all. That’s (a) vote for him.”Harris will travel to Detroit this week for a Tuesday radio town hall hosted by nationally syndicated radio co-host Charlamagne tha God, who has millions of followers across digital platforms, while “The Breakfast Club” enjoys a vast nationwide audience, much of it Black.","Score: 1

cnn,These are the states where abortion rights will – or could – be on the ballot in November,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/28/politics/state-abortion-ballot-measure-vote-dg/index.html,"CNN—This November, voters in at least 10 states will take to the polls to determine the future of abortion access in their state, after a nationwide effort by organizers to secure a wave of ballot measures aimed at restoring or protecting the right to an abortion — and some aimed at restricting it.Abortion rights advocates hope the effort will restore the issue of reproductive health access to the people, after the Supreme Court’sDobbs decisionoverturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the national right to an abortion.Most of the proposed ballot measures aim to enshrine the right to an abortion in state constitutions. They follow a series of restrictivetrigger lawsthat went into effect following the Dobbs decision, along with abortion policies that were handed down by politicians or decided by state supreme courts since the decision.Anti-abortion organizers backed a handful of initiatives aimed at restricting abortion access, thoughsimilar restrictive measures have failedin the few states where votes have been held in the past couple of years.Abortion measures on the ballot in NovemberTen states — Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and South Dakota — have already secured abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. All eyes are on Florida, which has served as a critical access point for people seeking services in a region of the country that is fast becoming anabortion care desert. A six-week abortion banreplaced the state’s 15-week banon May 1.Nebraska Secretary of State Robert Evnen announced in August that for the first time in the state’s history, two conflicting petition efforts made the same ballot.Now voters in Nebraska will voteon whether abortion rights will be enshrined in the constitution or whether the state’s current 12-week ban will be preserved.In this May 2023 photo, hundreds of people gather at the Nebraska Capitol to protest against a proposed abortion ban.Margery Beck/APRelated articleNebraska ballot can include competing measures to expand or limit abortion rights, high court rulesAfter organizers secured the New York Equal Rights Amendment on the 2024 ballot, it was briefly struck from the ballot by a state judge. State Attorney General Letitia James appealed that decision, and a state appeals court restored the measure to the ballot in June.A measure in Missouri that seeks to broadly protect reproductive care has made it onto the ballot, while an opposing measure to permanently ban abortion never made it out of the state’s legislative session.States with potential abortion ballot measuresOrganizers in states across the country have continued to work to secure funding, gather signatures and jump through the legal hoops necessary to secure abortion measures on the 2024 ballot.In most states, the process entails collecting a certain number of signatures by a designated deadline, while others require the additional step of having the ballot language approved by a state court, according to campaign organizers. The abortion rights measures are largely backed by coalitions of reproductive health advocates, many of which have fundraised to secure the money to support the campaigns.Organizers in Arkansas collected and submitted signatures for a proposed abortion rights measure, but the Secretary of State rejected their petition, saying the organizers did not correctly submit paperwork regarding paid canvassers. The state’s supreme court sided with the secretary, ensuring the measure will not be on the ballot this November.Lawmaker proposed measures in Iowa and Missouri to restrict or exclude the right to abortion in state constitutions did not make it out of legislative sessions. Lawmakers in Pennsylvania proposed a measure barring the use of public funding for abortions, which is unlikely to pass the state legislature.States that have voted on abortion post-DobbsSeven states have already seen a vote on abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and reproductive health advocates have been heartened by the overwhelming support for abortion access among voters. Every measure aimed at protecting abortion access has passed, while all measures to restrict it have failed.While support for abortion access is considered a given in states like California, organizers say these votes offer an important layer of legal protection for patients and providers – and send a message to elected officials about what voters want.CNN’s Molly English contributed to this report.","Score: 0

cnn,What happens if there’s a tie in 2024? Be ready for a ‘contingent election’,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/politics/tie-presidential-election-what-matters/index.html,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.CNN—When Robert F. Kennedy Jr.suspended his presidential campaign, he did it in the most complicated way.Get your head around this: Kennedy will take himself off the ballot in certain key states, but he is encouraging supporters to vote for him in safe red and blue states so that he can feature in a “contingent election” if former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris tie.In the battleground states, Kennedy said he’s supporting Trump.Could Kennedy actually feature in a “contingent election?” Short answer: No. He could not take part unless he won electoral votes, something that does not seem to be mathematically possible. Perhaps he’s envisioning an elector going rogue and supporting him in defiance of voters, but Kennedy did not share details of his thinking.For the facts about contingent elections, read on.With two presidential candidates fighting over a mere 538 Electoral College votes, a tie scenario is more than possible. It’s actually kind of surprising there has only been one tied election so far, in 1800, between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.That tie was the result of a failure of coordination by Democratic-Republicans, but it led to the nation’s first “contingent election,” decided in the House of Representatives.Could a tie actually happen this year?Yes. While a tie is not a likely outcome, it is something to be ready for. Here is one plausible scenario for the 2024 election:If Harris wins Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada and a single electoral vote in Nebraska, all of which Joe Biden won in 2020, but she loses Pennsylvania and Georgia, there’s a tie, 269-269.The website270 to Winalso has more tied-election scenarios.Unlike every other state, Maine and Nebraska award two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner of each congressional district. Those individual, competitive electoral votes in Maine and Nebraska become hugely consequential in potential tie scenarios.Make your own 269-269 scenario withCNN’s interactive election map.What happens if there’s a tie?If there’s a 269-269 tie, or if a third party or independent candidate wins electoral votes and keeps a candidate from reaching an Electoral College majority of 270, the next step is the same. It’s called a “contingent election.”According to the12th Amendment, enacted in the wake of that divisive 1800 election, if no candidate gets a majority of the Electoral College votes, the new Congress, which would have just been sworn in on January 3, chooses the president. The Senate would choose the vice president.When would a ‘contingent election’ occur?According to an analysis by theCongressional Research Service, a contingent election would occur on January 6, immediately after members of Congress met to count electoral votes and determined that no candidate had a majority.There is a lot of information from that CRS report in this story. While it dates back to 2017, it’s still a valuable resource.How would the process work?The nation would clearly be divided. Lawmakers could be torn between supporting their preferred candidate and the one their state’s voters preferred.In a contingent election, the House selects the president and the Senate selects the vice president. House members can only choose from among the top three finishers in the Electoral College for president, and senators can choose from among the top two finishers for vice president. Kennedy would presumably need to win electoral votes – win a state or a congressional district in Nebraska or Maine – in order to be an option in a contingent election. There’s no chance of that happening at the moment.Rather than voting as individuals, each state delegation in the House would get one vote, although how the state delegations select their preferred candidate is not spelled out.A simple majority, 26 state delegation votes, would appoint the new president.If state delegations in the House did not select a president by Inauguration Day, January 20, the new vice president selected by the Senatewould become temporary president. It is possible the Senate could select a vice president when the House is deadlocked, because in the Senate each senator would get one vote.If the Senate had not selected a vice president by January 20, the presidential succession plan in the 20th Amendment temporarily takes effect. First in line after the vice president is the speaker of the House, currently Mike Johnson, although it could be a different Republican or a Democrat if Democrats win a majority in the House this November.Does either side have an advantage?If the Electoral College already benefits smaller and more rural states, the contingent election process – in which each state, regardless of population, has an equal vote – gives them a huge advantage.California and Texas get the same say as Delaware and Wyoming in a contingent election. Plus, Washington, DC, which gets three votes in the Electoral College, would be cut out of the contingent election.There’s nothing to require state delegations to honor the winner of their state’s vote. And in closely divided states, the results in single seats, perhaps determined by gerrymandered congressional maps, could swing a delegation’s vote.CNNRelated articleWhat to expect in the sprint to Election Day – and beyondHeading into the 2024 election, Republican lawmakers held a majority in 26 states, compared with Democrats, who held the majority in 22, with ties in Minnesota and North Carolina. Republicans in North Carolina have changed the state’s congressional map, however, and it is likely to have a majority-Republican congressional delegation in January. Republicans are likely to maintain their advantage next year, especially if voters are so split that they deliver a national tie at the top of the ticket.In Arizona, for instance, who is to say that a potential majority of Republican members of Congresswould vote for the Democratic candidate, even if Harris pulled out a narrow win there?Would Alaska’s Democratic member of Congress, assuming she wins reelection, vote for the Democrat for president even though her state is likely to go for Trump in November?Why does this bizarre tie-break system exist?It’s actually meant to be an improvement. The way the Electoral College was first assembled, electors voted for two candidates. Whoever got the most votes was president and whoever got the second-most votes was vice president.By the time political parties were forming – Federalists and Democratic-Republicans in 1800 – electors needed to coordinate to cast more votes for their presidential pick than their vice presidential pick.In the1800 election, a rematch of 1796, Jefferson’s Democratic-Republicans beat incumbent President and Federalist John Adams.But the Democratic-Republicans were poorly coordinated or bad at counting and foolishly cast equal numbers of votes for their presidential pick, Jefferson, and his running mate, Burr.Out of pique, when the early version of the contingent election rolled around, the Federalists, who still controlled the House at that time, backed Burr. Despite the intervention of Alexander Hamilton, a noted Federalist, it took 36 rounds of voting to finally elect Jefferson.By 1804, the 12th Amendment was being ratified.Has a contingent election happened in the years since the tied election of 1800?Yes.In 1824, multiple candidates got votes in the Electoral College but none of them received a majority, triggering a contingent election.Amazingly, from today’s perspective, all of the candidates who got Electoral College votes that year were from the same Democratic-Republican political party, although they were split into regional sects.Andrew Jackson won 40% of the popular vote and got the most votes in the Electoral College with 99 of the 131needed for victory. But the House ultimately picked his top rival, John Quincy Adams, whose father lost that 1800 election.Jackson would have his revenge with a victory four years later, and John Quincy Adams would round out his career as the only former president to be elected to Congress, the body that made him president.Another contingent election occurred with the 1836 race, but just for vice president. Virginia’s electors did not like Robert M. Johnson, the running mate of election winner Martin Van Buren, and withheld their votes for him in the Electoral College. The Senate later elevated Johnson to the vice presidency in a contingent election.What about the disputed election of 1876?In 1876, when there was a contested outcome, the contingent election system was bypassed.That year, at the height of Reconstruction, the issue was not that no person got a majority in the Electoral College, but rather that three Southern states – Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina – sent multiple slates of electoral votes to Washington, DC, after the state elections were disputed. And in Oregon, there was a dispute over one elector.Congress created a special bipartisan commission, with one more Republican than Democrats, to determine which candidate should get the 20 disputed electoral votes. They ultimately gave the votes to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes even though Democrat Samuel Tilden got more popular votes.Hayes thenlargely ended Reconstruction, perhaps as part of a secret deal that gave him the White House.This story has been updated with additional developments.","Score: 0

The October 1vice presidential debatebetween Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrat, and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican, was likely the last meeting between the Democratic campaign led by Vice President Kamala Harris and the Republican campaign led by former President Donald Trump.While the scene is set for what pollsters expect could be an extremely close election,there will be unexpected developments between now and Election Day on November 5.Nobody expected President Joe Biden’scampaign to implodeafter theshock of his performance at CNN’s debate in late June. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Harris as his replacement.Nobody expected anassassination attempt against Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience.So we don’t know specifically what will happen between now andElection Day, or what could come after, when the country’s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect:Voting is well underwayCNNRelated articleYour personalized voter handbook for the presidential electionWhile Election Day isn’t until November 5, most states allow some kind of early voting, either by mail or in person, and that process kicks into overdrive in October.Most Americans, nearly 70%, voted early or by mail in 2020, according tocensus figures, although that figure was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.The campaigns will be focused on getting out the vote in the few key battleground states they think are up for grabs. In 2020, Biden won five states that Trump won in 2016. Those states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – could again be the focus in 2024 when Harris, who turns 60 in October, takes on Trump.It’s important to be sure you’re registered to vote as soon as possible, which can usually be done online. Twenty-three states and Washington, DC, allow Election Day voter registration.Election Day and beyondUS law requires federal elections to take place on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that’s November 5.People who don’t vote early will hit their local voting location. Polls will close at different times around the country. Due to the rise of voting by mail, if key states are close, like they were in 2020, we probably won’t know the winner on Election Day.Regardless, expect lawsuits in certain states and the potential for recounts in others. Election Day is far from the end of the election.Separately,Trump’s sentencingon 34 counts of falsifying business records is now scheduled for November 26.Also this month: Biden turns 82.December: Electoral votes are castAfter questions about the election are settled, states confirm, or ascertain, their statewide results.

It’s this new Congress that, in the unlikely event ofan Electoral College tie, would settle the election. Each state would get one vote for president in the House of Representatives.In any event, lawmakers gather on January 6, as everyone should remember from 2020, to count electoral votes. Harris will preside.

cnn,Milwaukee’s Black voters expose cracks in Democratic foundation for Harris,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/11/politics/milwaukee-black-voters-kamala-harris/index.html,"Milwaukee, WisconsinCNN—Devonta Johnson is going door to door, clipboard in hand, wearing a bright yellow vest and a seemingly permanent smile.“How do you feel about Kamala Harris?” Johnson asks when a woman answers the door and steps out onto the porch.“I think she is great,” the woman says, and Johnson’s smile gets even bigger.“How do you feel about Trump?” he asks.“Not so great,” is the quick response.The conversation lasts another minute or so, as Johnson runs through early voting opportunities and asks for a phone number so he can check back and make sure supporting Harris translates into voting for her. Then a pleasant goodbye, and Johnson turns back to the sidewalk and heads to the next knock.Johnson and his colleagues from Black Leaders Organizing for Communities walk these streets year-round. But their steps are now a bit quicker and the falling leaves add a little color and crunching sound. The Halloween decorations on the lawn tell us the calendar is moving. So does the new script the canvassers are carrying.“I just wanted to remind you that early voting starts on October 22,” one says to a man who steps out to talk.It is turnout time, and any path to a Democratic victory in Wisconsin – which flipped from Trump to Joe Biden four years ago – begins in these overwhelmingly Black neighborhoods on Milwaukee’s north side.“There’s a lot of momentum,” says Angela Lang, a veteran organizer who is the BLOC executive director. “Generally speaking, people feel pretty good about where we are at.”The energy and activism among Black women is obvious. Plus, Lang says, her conversations with other organizers suggest perhaps a few surprises in the Wisconsin count.“You can’t win a statewide election here without going through the heart of Milwaukee and in some cases that runs through this office and the work that our team does,” Lang said in an interview. “But we are also seeing folks in heavily red areas that are getting together with other women at coffee shops without their husbands knowing, for example, and starting to have those conversations.”Veteran organizer Angela Lang, the founder and executive director of BLOC (Black Leaders Organizing for Communities), speaks to canvassers about the state of the presidential race.CNNWe first visited Lang and BLOC a year ago, in the early weeks of our CNN project –“All Over The Map”– to track the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are members of crucial voting blocs.It is obvious that Harris is in better shape now than Biden was during that first visit last October.Back then, even Johnson, then 21, said he was not sure who he would vote for, describing Biden and Trump as too old and disconnected from his generation. Now, he is as excited to vote for Harris as he is to knock doors organizing for her and other Democrats.“At the time, I was like kind of iffy, feeling like everybody else, kind of undecided,” Johnson said of his choices before Harris got in the race. “But now that Kamala got the ball and she rollin’ with it, I feel like oh yeah. … She’s making a good image for herself and for the Democrats.”A year ago, Lang was blunt about Biden’s struggles in Milwaukee’s Black neighborhoods. Now she says there is energy around Harris and myriad efforts to find creative ways to generate high turnout.“It’s extremely different,” Lang said.Cracks in the Democratic coalitionYet she candidly discussed cracks and concerns in the Democratic foundation, which were on clear display as we walked with the canvassers and sat in on the meeting in which they share notes about what they call being “on doors.”Some who answer don’t plan to vote.“Because they say it isn’t going to change anything,” one of the canvassers said at the meeting.Young Black voters are harder to motivate.“We still got a job to do,” one of the canvassers told her colleagues. “They have a lot of questions that’s not answered.”But by far the biggest worry is Black men.Two things come up the most.“People are, like, ‘I think I had more money in my pocket when Trump was in office because of the stimulus checks during the pandemic,’” Lang said.She tells canvassers to point out Congress passed that funding and that Trump initially opposed the idea, though he in the end had his signature printed on the checks.The second concern is about how Harris got her start in politics: as a county prosecutor and later as California’s attorney general.“It makes sense why people may have a little bit of a pause,” Lang said of the vice president’s background in law enforcement. “I myself did as well.”Now she tells canvassers that a key Harris priority as a prosecutor were programs designed to reduce recidivism.‘They look at a man as being a leader’Undecided Wisconsin voter Brian McMutuary lists the rising cost of living as one of his main concerns.Jacqueline Kalil/CNNBrian McMutuary says he is open to listening in the final days. He was a lifelong Democrat until he voted for Trump in 2020.He disagrees with Trump on abortion rights and immigration. But he likes the former president’s take on cryptocurrency and remembers being better off when Trump was president.“When I go to the grocery store, I get what I need, not so much what I want or what the kids want,” McMutuary said in an interview in Menomonee Falls, a Milwaukee suburb. “We need to make it each week. We have a budget, you know. It is tight.”McMutuary also says he worries Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping would not treat Harris as an equal.“They look at a man as being a leader,” he said.He said he had no problem with a woman president.“Nope, not at all,” McMutuary said. “It’s about doing the right thing for the country.”Eric Jones says he has heard that and more as he makes the rounds getting coffee, going to the barbershop or in his real estate business.“If I were a gambling man, I would probably put my money on Harris,” Jones told us in an interview at Confectionately Yours, a new Black-owned coffee shop and bakery on Milwaukee’s Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.Milwaukee-based entrepreneur Eric Jones describes the change in ""energy"" and voter enthusiasm since Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee.Jacqueline Kalil/CNN“Things are getting better,” Jones said. “The numbers are better.

It’s a lot different from when we were here last time, especially in terms of the election.”Still, he sees the same cracks and doubts relayed by the BLOC community organizers, especially among Black men.“They’ll say, ‘I had more money when he was the president,’’’ Jones said.Harris’ work as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general might help woo suburban voters but, at a minimum, raises questions here.“Law enforcement has not been kind to Black people historically,” Jones said. “District attorneys have not been kind to Black people historically.”Jones also says abortion and transgender rights have come up in some recent debates at stops in the community.“The good old party feels they have a monopoly on the Christian vote,” Jones said. “The Democratic Party feels they have a monopoly over the Black vote. The problem is there are a lot of Blacks that are Christians and the Black church is one of the strongest institutions in the Black community, right?”“So you have this tug of war in a city that I’m pretty sure the Black folk will decide who wins that city, and more than likely, the presidency.”","Score: 0

cnn,"Michigan young voters enthused for Harris, but their level of support is still a big question",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/politics/michigan-students-kamala-harris-israel-hamas/index.html,"Ann Arbor, MichiganCNN—The campus art museum doubles as a voting hub. There are voter registration tables seemingly everywhere. Even the sleeves at the campus coffee shop have a message: “Wolverines: Let’s Vote Early.”So Jade Gray bristles a bit at this hypothetical: What if Kamala Harris comes up just short in battleground Michigan?“If she comes up short in Michigan, I don’t think it’s because of young voters,” said Gray, a former co-president of the University of Michigan College Democrats who graduated in May. “I think it’s probably because we waited too long to make a switch of the candidate.”Voters aged 18-29 area vital pieceof the Democratic coalition. They were crucial toJoe Biden’s2020 Michigan win and in the dramatic state-level gains the party made in 2022. But young voters’ level of support is a big question for 2024 because of anger and disappointment with how the Biden-Harris administration has handledthe Israel-Hamas conflict.“I don’t think there is any blame to put on young people or people of color or Muslim voters in this election cycle, and I quite frankly don’t really want to hear about that,” Gray said in an interview. “I think that you got to put that on campaigns, and you have to put that on the elected officials that are running for office. I sure hope she doesn’t come up short in Michigan, because I don’t really want to be talking to people about how young people should have done more when I feel like we’re doing a lot.”The conversation with Gray and Anushka Jalisatgi, also co-president of the College Democrats last school year, was our third in 11 months. Both are part of a CNN project, calledAll Over the Map, designed to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are part of crucial voting blocs.In the twoprior conversations, both said Biden’s age was a concern for many young voters who felt little connection to the octogenarian president. Now, with Harris as the Democratic nominee, the energy and enthusiasm difference is obvious.Gray now works as a digital organizer for a progressive group.“I have noticed a significant shift in activity, across the board,” Gray said.Jalisatgi is back on campus as a first-year law student, and just switched her voter registration to Michigan.“A lot of my out-of-state friends are switching their registration to Michigan because it is a battleground state,” Jalisatgi said.The voting hub at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.CNNAnd while Gray and Jalisatgi have moved on, the College Democrats are in high gear for election crunch time. A Harris campaign official stopped by a meeting during our latest visit and a crowded room of students spent time phone banking after getting a pep talk from the state’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer.“The work that you are doing is so important and I am energized by what I see happening with all these Dem clubs on campuses. You are kicking a**. So, we just got to keep rolling through,” Whitmer said over a video link.Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell stopped by in person, and warned against overconfidence.“I’m going to look you all in the eye and tell you, neither candidate is winning in Michigan right now.”No encampment on campus, but tensions still high over Israel-Hamas conflictThe almost everywhere-you-look focus on registration and early voting at the Ann Arbor campus is remarkable.One registration table we stopped by on our latest visit was in a familiar spot: on the same campus path where students last semester built an encampment to air their grievances at Israel, at the Biden administration and at school officials they were pushing to divest from companies that do business with Israel.The school will not allow a new encampment, so it is harder to gauge how much the raw anger of last semester has carried over to the new school year – and into voting decisions.“A lot of that energy, because it can’t happen in a physical space – it’s still occupying a lot of online space,” Gray said.Jalisatgi sees it directed less at Harris and more at university officials.“People still very much care that this is ongoing and that the university is complicit in contributing to it,” Jalisatgi said. “I’m seeing universities putting out a lot of new free speech guidelines, new regulations for how they want to curb free speech or how they want to regulate it.”University of Michigan student Max Scheske walks with John King on campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan.CNNThe Ann Arbor College Republicans would not let CNN into a meeting they held during our recent visit.Member Max Scheske, a junior, said attendance and energy are up some as the election draws close. But he also said the group was pretty evenly divided when it comes to enthusiasm forDonald Trump.“We certainly do have our, you know, ‘Trump is basically Jesus’ wing of the club,” Scheske said. “But we do have a very sizeable, you know, very critical of Trump.”Scheske describes himself as libertarian and Trump as a populist. “So, he is kind of hit or miss with me,” Scheske said.There are Harris yard signs and posters and placards all around Ann Arbor. Signs of Trump support are much harder to find. On campus, Scheske said Trump’s unequivocal support for Israel makes it harder to win over Democrats critical of the Biden-Harris administration’s defense of the Jewish state.“If it was up to me, he would not have been the Republican nominee,” Scheske said.‘We feel a sense of betrayal’The biggest risk for Harris is that young voters stay home, skip the presidential line on the ballot, or vote third party.In May, Wayne State student Summer Matkin was leaning third party. Biden was the Democratic nominee then, and she had concerns both about his age and the Israel-Hamas conflict.Now, she calls Harris “the safest option” even though she is frustrated the bloodshed in the Middle East continues.There were signs of trouble for Harris, though, when we stopped by a meeting of the Wayne State Syrian Students Association.The roughly 20 students in the room did not want to be quoted by name or have their faces captured on camera. But when asked if they would have a hard time voting for Harris, nearly every hand in the room went up.Wayne State student Wahbeh Nuseibeh talks with John King in Dearborn, Michigan.CNNLikewise, Wahbeh Nuseibeh, a 26-year-old Wayne State student, said he would not vote for Harris in 2024 after voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020.“We feel a sense of betrayal,” said Nuseibeh, who is Palestinian.“I’m not voting for Kamala Harris. I cannot in good conscience,” he said. In his view, his tax dollars pay for bombs shipped to Israel “to kill my friends and family overseas.”Nuseibeh will likely choose a third-party option.“Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy and a threat to our society,” he said in an interview at a Yemeni coffee shop in majority Arab American Dearborn just outside Detroit.Maya Siegmann will cast her vote for Harris, though she found the vice president’s debate answers far too vague.“She didn’t directly answer most of the questions and seemed to go around them or could not give a real answer,” Siegmann said. “And when the topic of the Israel-Hamas war came up, there wasn’t really a solid response as to how she would solve it.”Siegmann is active in the Hillel campus Jewish organization at Wayne State and just got back from a summer in Israel. There, she said, she was asked a lot about public opinion in the United States.“The response was basically that the propaganda war, the social media war, the news war that Hamas and Israel are fighting, Hamas is winning right now,” Siegmann said.Wayne State student Maya Siegmann talks with John King on campus in Detroit, Michigan.CNNLast year was tense on campus and as both the October 7 anniversary of Hamas’ attack on Israel and then the US election draw near, Siegmann said she is mindful that emotions could get high again. She is a proud Jew and fervent supporter of Israel, but she is also critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his conduct of the war.But she says such nuance can get quickly lost when passions get high.“I worry that when it does come up, because we have different classes, like policy classes, that it will be an argument and less a discussion.”The campus has a large Arab and Muslim population, and Siegmann said this semester she is making more of an effort to get to know classmates better.“These are people I am going to be with until I complete my degree or degrees,” she said. “So I want to kind of form that solid groundwork so that I can build off that.”","Score: 0

cnn,Economic worries boost Trump’s Hispanic support in battleground Nevada,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/nevada-hispanic-voters-trump-harris/index.html,"Henderson, NevadaCNN—The sounds of blasting and bulldozing in the hills overlooking Las Vegas are proof change is a constant here, with the new $5 million homes evidence of the vibrant, upscale demand.It is progress, longtime Las Vegas real estate agent Zoila Sanchez says, as she points out new construction from the patio of her own home in suburban Henderson. But it is also a reminder of a major economic and political issue here.Rents are on the rise, and starter homes are scarce. The wealthy can find what they want – or build it – but working-class families face a housing crunch.“Prices are extremely high – the highest they’ve ever been,” Sanchez said in an interview. “And with interest rates being really high, the affordability is not there for a lot of people.”Sanchez says a Federal Reserve interest rate cut would help, and she is counting on one soon not only to help her business and local families but also her candidate for president: Kamala Harris.“She’s a very smart lady,” Sanchez said of the vice president. “She talks to me. She just says everything that I need to hear.”That’s coming from a self-described Reagan Republican who hopes to one day soon vote GOP for president again. But not with Donald Trump atop the ticket.“I’ve never liked anything about him,” Sanchez said of the former president. “Nothing. The way he speaks. What he represents.  … You know, that we immigrants are the worst. That we are coming from mental institutions and jails and everything else. Which is not true.”Las Vegas-based real estate agent Zoila Sanchez photographed outside of her home in Henderson, Nevada.Jacqueline Kalil/CNNTrump narrowly lost Nevada in both 2016 and 2020. Sanchez concedes she hears more support for him this time among Latino voters, especially men.“I want to understand it,” she said. “And I can’t. I realty can’t. … I think it is kind of a macho thing.”When we first met last December, Sanchez was ready to vote a second time for Joe Biden, mostly because of her animus toward Trump. Now, she says she is excited to vote for Harris. “If we get to elect the first women president, I mean, I just get chills to witness history,” she said.Sanchez is confident, insisting the energy she sees for Harris outweighs the increased Trump talk among fellow Hispanics.“I know that Hispanics have made a difference in a lot of elections, and I can see it right now,” Sanchez said.Hispanic voters up for grabsRogelio Regalado and Rafael Cerros Jr. are not so sure.Close friends, Regalado and Cerros took a risk in 2020 – in the middle of the pandemic – and launched a local radio station, Fiesta 98.1. Their little startup is now No. 2 in a competitive Vegas Spanish language market.Cerros works the business side and says he is undecided in the presidential race at the moment.Regalado is the afternoon drive-time host, from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays, and describes himself as leaning Harris but eager to see her work harder for the Hispanic vote.“I feel the Democrats take the Hispanic vote for granted here in Vegas or in Nevada,” Cerros said. “We are one-third of the population. Last time I checked, it’s like 23% of voter registration.”The station has a weekend political show, and the campaign sometimes also comes up during the week when listeners call in to discuss music or compete for prizes. Plus the station is often represented at local events.Fiesta 98.1 co-owner and radio personality Rogelio Regalado prepares to go on air.Jacqueline Kalil/CNNFiesta 98.1 founding partner Rafael Cerros Jr. stands outside of the radio station’s offices in downtown Las Vegas.Jacqueline Kalil/CNN“I see people on social media, Hispanics, sharing that post ‘I’m not with Her.’ I’m, like, wow,” Regalado said.Cerros added: “A lot of people are calling me, or calling us – Latinos, you know, talking about voting for Trump.”Both said the economy is by far the biggest reason people they know who were solid Democrats are at least open to supporting Trump.“It is 100% that,” Cerros said.Nevada was crushed during the Covid pandemic because it is so reliant on tourism. The state had the highest pandemic unemployment rate, at one point just shy of 31% – more than twice the national average. The statistics now are clear: the jobs are back, and then some. But the bruises linger, and working families trying to put the pandemic stress behind them have faced housing and inflation pressures.“We have seen the record numbers at the casinos,” Regalado said. “But some businesses are struggling still.”Cerros said Fiesta 98.1’s advertisers are mostly small, Latino-owned businesses. “A lot of small businesses are struggling,” he said. “It’s not 100% yet, to where it was. Especially with inflation.”A Muslim voter who agrees with Harris on most issues is eyeing third-party optionZena Hajji presents a different problem for Harris.Muslims are just a tiny slice of Nevada’s population, but every vote and constituency matter in a battleground settled by 33,596 votes four years ago.“A lot of Muslims are angry they are being somehow — and I would say, unfortunately — partner to the issues that are happening abroad,” Hajji said in an interview at her Henderson home.“I don’t want my tax dollars to be able to hurt people, especially when I work so hard to focus on helping people here,” Hajji said.Zena Hajji opens a jar of her mother’s homemade pickled olives at their home in Henderson, Nevada.Jacqueline Kalil/CNNThe 21-year-old Democrat, who’s a proud daughter of Moroccan immigrants, stands with Harris on just about every issue. But the Biden administration’s support of Israel as the conflict with Hamas drags on leaves Hajji pondering a third-party vote or just skipping the presidential line on the ballot.“Why would you keep voting for a group of people that promises no more bombs, no more pain, peace in the Middle East,” Hajji said, noting that those vows haven’t held up. She said Harris is more explicit than Biden in calling for an end to the killing of Palestinian civilians, but that words are not enough.“We just need a ceasefire,” she said. “That’s it. We just need it to stop. … We are tired. We are very, very tired. And we don’t know what to do with our votes right now.”Leaning Harris but looking for more specificsAntonio Munoz is a man of contagious optimism. A veteran, retired police officer and now the owner of the 911 Taco Bar in El Mercado, a former JC Penny department store that now houses dozens of Hispanic small businesses.When we first met last December, he was undecided in the presidential race and unhappy with the prospect of a Biden-Trump rematch. In that meeting, he bet neither Trump nor Biden would be on the ballot in the end. He was half right.Leaning Harris is where Munoz is now – intrigued and excited but also still frustrated he cannot find more specifics about her promise to help small businesses like his.“I’ve been checking her website and you read it, but it’s not specific,” Munoz said. “We do need to move forward. We need a different plan to get over the hump with this inflation that has caused severe damage to a lot of businesses. … She needs to be more direct.”A scorching summer was the latest challenge, stifling the catering business critical to Munoz’s bottom line.“We had over 30 days of 110 degrees,” Munoz said. “So we had a lot of cancellations because people didn’t want to be outside.”Antonio Munoz, owner of 911 Taco Bar, checks in on his staff during the lunch hour rush.Jacqueline Kalil/CNNNow he sees a competitive election as a pause button.“Because people are afraid to go out and spend,” he said. “They don’t know what to expect when it comes around to a new administration.”Evidence of new energy for Harris begins at home for Munoz. He says his wife is excited, and that he shares her view that there is inspiration in the vice president’s story.“She came up with immigrant parents, which to me, it’s amazing for someone like that to come up and be able to be president,” Munoz said. “It’s a hit for people.”He also has no patience when Trump slams immigrants or berates the country he wants to lead.“One of the things that hurts me the most is for him to talk down America,” Munoz said. “America is a world leader. We have always been. … We’re the best. No matter who is there. The people make it the best.”But Munoz said many friends and others he encounters at community events are nostalgic for the pre-Covid economy and think that Trump is a better choice for their bottom line. Nevada also elected a Republican governor in 2022, and Munoz believes that makes it more hospitable climate for Trump this year.“He has grown,” Munoz said of the former president’s support among Hispanics. “I have friends that were Democrats who have turned the page. They feel that the country is not going in the right direction.”Harris, though, is more competitive than Biden would have been and Munoz predicts a Nevada nailbiter.“It’s a 50-50 tossup,” he said. “They need to be out here with a direct message and talking to the voters out here. I really think it is 50-50 right now. It is tight.”","Score: 0

cnn,Why Iowa Republicans who once opposed Trump are ready to vote for him,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/18/politics/iowa-republicans-trump-2024/index.html,"Kellerton, IowaCNN—Shanen Ebersole is voting for Donald Trump. With plenty of reservations, but zero hesitation.“It’s definitely a vote for Trump,” Ebersole said. “I’m happy doing that with the choices that we have. I don’t think there is any way I could vote any other direction.”Ebersole was a Nikki Haley supporter when we first met before the Iowa caucuses. Trump won 59% of the caucus vote in conservative Ringgold County; Ebersole was one of just 16 votes for the former South Carolina governor.Once Trump locked up the GOP nomination, Ebersole thought a bit about voting third party. But her maverick streak has limits. Her family and her farm come first, so she came home to Trump.“Because we have to put the American people first,” she said in an interview along the fence line of the Ebersole cattle farm. “I think that the policies that have been in place in the Harris-Biden administration — they hurt this. They hurt our land and they hurt the people of middle America the most.”Ebersole is part of ourAll Over the Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are members of critical voting blocs or areas in those states.John King talks to Iowa voter Shanen Ebersole on her cattle ranch in Kellerton, Iowa.CNNIowa was an early 2024 battleground — the first test of whether Trump’s grip on the GOP had been loosened by his 2020 loss, his conduct on January 6, 2021, or any of the myriad criminal and civil legal proceedings he has faced since leaving the White House.Trump won the caucuses with 51%— the beginning of a march to the nomination that proved his grip on the party remains quite firm but also exposed important weaknesses.One was among Republican women like Ebersole — those who supported Haley or other GOP contenders because they object to Trump’s combative and often caustic tone and, in many cases, see him as wandering too far from the conservative principles that drew them to the Republican Party.Iowa, of course, is not considered a battleground in the general election this year. Ebersole’s “pretty simple” decision to support Trump despite her reservations helps explain why.In the 12 presidential elections dating back to 1976, Iowa was evenly split in its choice for president. But Republicans have dominated of late. Trump won in both 2016 and 2020. Both of the state’s US senators are Republican, as are six of Iowa’s seven statewide constitutional offices.Voters who say life was better under Trump fear Democrats have shifted too far leftEbersole shared a view quite common here: that the Democratic Party is trending more liberal, more coastal, and more in favor of government mandates in climate and land policies.“I’m not saying that there are not things we can do to improve,” Ebersole said. “But if you talk to a lot of us, we’re already doing things. There’s a huge regenerative movement here in the Americas by choice, not my mandate. I think that is the main thing that matters in politics — that we get to choose. We’re not being mandated to choose. … We just want to live in the middle of nowhere and raise cows and feed our neighbors across the country.”Ebersole said Trump’s trade policies were better for her business.“It was much harder to import beef,” she said. “Now most meat that you eat, on the American grocery store shelves, isn’t American beef, and that really concerns me﻿.” She sees Vice President Kamala Harris as more liberal — and more likely to favor activist government — than President Joe Biden.“She is willing to push her agendas on those of us who live a totally different life,” Ebersole said, tying Harris to California’s policies. “Our California rancher friends are completely decimated by the policies and the government. Not by their weather conditions, not by any of those things, but by the government policies.”Harris was the California attorney general from 2011-2017 and has worked in Washington since becoming a senator and now vice president.The conversation is different here than in the swing states. On recent visits toArizonaandPennsylvania, for example, some of our Republican voters who are not Trump fans said they would give Harris a chance to make her case. But in Iowa, the Republicans in our group were harshly critical of the vice president and more comfortable with coming home to the GOP despite issues they may have with Trump and his most vocal MAGA allies.“Most of the people that vote for Trump are just quiet people who want to live our own lives in our own place,” Ebersole said. “We’re willing to tell those people to quiet down a bit.”It may seem an odd time to visit Iowa, given its status as a solid red state, when considering each candidate’s strategy to win 270 electoral votes. But we wanted to better understand why those who were so critical of Trump at the beginning of the campaign cycle are so comfortable supporting him now. We wanted a firsthand look at how our Iowa group — the first one we visited in August 2023 — views the race now that Harris has replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket and chosen a Midwest governor, Tim Walz of Minnesota, to be her running mate.“He’s trying to figure out how to deal with her,” Chris Mudd, a businessman from Cedar Falls, said of Trump, whom he ardently supports. “I think he spends too much time bashing and complaining. … I think he’ll catch his stride. I think he will get back on his horse.”John King talks with Iowa voter Chris Mudd in Cedar Falls.CNNMudd owns Midwest Solar, and business is strong in part because of Biden administration clean energy tax incentives.But Mudd would gladly give up that help in exchange for Trump’s policies on regulation and immigration.“If all I was selling was government incentives, I don’t think business would be very good,” Mudd said in an interview at his home. “But that’s not what we’re selling. We’re selling the power to help people save money.”Mudd also believes Trump is more tested on the world stage.“I think about what’s happening in the Middle East,” Mudd said. “Who would I want to negotiate that peace? Kamala or Donald Trump? And for me, it’s simple.”Mudd believes the media is too soft on Harris, and he echoes Trump and his MAGA media allies in complaining the vice president rarely takes questions from reporters. He also echoes another line coming from Trump, suggesting there is no way Harris can win an honest election.“There were shenanigans,” Mudd said when asked what he would think if Harris wins the White House. “I don’t think she has a chance to win in a fair fight. … I just don’t believe it is possible. I really don’t. … Many like me would think the same thing: If Kamala Harris gets 81 million votes, something really went haywire.”Previously leaning toward Biden in a 2020 rematch, but now for TrumpBetsy Sarcone considers such talk a waste of time.“I don’t buy the stolen election,” said Sarcone, a mother of three who lives in the Des Moines suburbs. “If she wins, she wins. I am not getting on that bandwagon.”But the fact that Sarcone plans to vote for Trump is a big change from our first conversation just over a year ago.Then, she said it was time for the Republican Party to find new leadership and that if the 2024 election ended up as a 2020 rematch, she would vote for Biden.John King sits with Iowa voter Betsy Sarcone and her family in West Des Moines, Iowa.CNNBut Sarcone said grocery prices are still too high, her real estate business too slow.“I would describe myself as being resigned to voting for Donald Trump,” Sarcone said. “I just can’t vote for the status quo and I was absolutely better off during Donald Trump’s presidency than I am today.”Sarcone has a dim view of Harris.“She’s already been in office,” she said. “She could have done something about the economy. She could have done something about the border.”Like the others in our Iowa group, Sarcone places Harris to the left of Biden.“I’d say far left,” she said. “I’d say woke.”Sarcone sees Trump as rattled by the switch to Harris.“I think he is handling it wrong,” she said. “I wish that he would stick to the issues and cut the side conversations that are not relevant.”John King and Iowa voter Priscilla Forsyth at a baseball game in Sioux City, Iowa.CNNSioux City attorney Priscilla Forsyth, too, sees Trump as off his game now that Harris is his opponent.“She’s pulling his chain,” Forsyth said. “I don’t think he knows what to think.”When we first met Forsyth last August, she was impressed with another GOP candidate, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Soon, though, she would label him shallow and childish and shift her allegiance to Haley.Now, though, Forsyth sees Harris as “radical” and has no qualms about voting for Trump.“I see Kamala and I see Walz as being so far left it concerns me,” Forsyth said in an interview.“I’m comfortable with Trump. We had four years of Trump. We know what Trump is. We know what to expect. We all survived. … I’m not voting for him to be my valentine. I’m not voting for him to be my best friend. I think he did an OK job running the country.”","Score: 0

cnn,Fact check: Vance falsely claims Trump did not ‘go after his political opponents’ as president,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/fact-check-vance-trump-political-opponents/index.html,"WashingtonCNN—Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, falsely claimed Sunday that former President Donald Trump “didn’t go after his political opponents” during his presidency – an assertion that is contradicted by a mountain of evidence.Vance, who saidFridaythat the attorney general would be the most important government official other than the president in a second Trump administration, wasaskedby ABC News host Martha Raddatz in an interview on Sunday if Trump would go after his political opponents. Vance said no, thenadded, “Martha, he was president for four years and he didn’t go after his political opponents.”Facts First:Vance’s claim is false. As president, Trump publicly and privately pressured the Justice Department, and others in his administration, to investigate or prosecute numerous political opponents.Trump madeextensive behind-the-scenes effortsto get his political opponents charged with crimes. But you don’t have to rely on investigative reporting or the memoirs of former administration officials to know that Trump went after political opponents as president.He often went after them in public, too.As CNN reporter Marshall Cohen hasnoted, there is a long list of political opponents whom Trump publicly called for the Justice Department and others to investigate or prosecute. The list includes not only 2016 election opponentHillary Clintonand 2020 election opponentJoe Bidenbut alsoBiden’s son Hunter Biden,Democratic former Secretary of State John Kerry,Trump’s former national security advisor turned critic John Bolton,Democratic former President Barack Obama,unspecified Obama administration officials,the anonymous author of a New York Times op-ed by a Trump administration official critical of Trump,MSNBC host and Trump critic Joe Scarborough,former FBI director turned Trump critic James Comey,other former FBI officials,former British spy Christopher Steele(the author of a controversial dossier of allegations against Trump), and various congressional Democrats – includingformer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,Rep. Adam Schiff of California,Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota,Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, andSen. Mark Warner of Virginia.Asked for comment for this article on Monday, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk accused the media of having a biased “double standard” and said “it is indisputable that under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s DOJ, the Republican nominee for president was targeted and indicted, while under President Trump, nothing like that ever transpired against either of the Democrats he faced off with in 2016 or 2020.”But that wasn’t for a lack of Trump trying.Trump repeatedly pressured the Justice Department as president to prosecute both Clinton and Biden, in addition totrying to get foreign countries to investigate Biden. That the Trump-era Justice Department declined to charge Clinton and Biden doesn’t mean it’s true that Trump didn’t “go after” them or others. (In fact, Trumpliterally saidin 2017 that he wanted the department to be “going after” Clinton.)John Kelly, whom Trump appointed as Secretary of Homeland Security and then White House chief of staff,told The New York Times in 2023of Trump: “He was always telling me that we need to use the FBI and IRS to go after people – it was constant and obsessive and is just what he’s claiming is being done to him now.”And contrary to Vance’s claim to Raddatz that Harris has herself tried to arrest political opponents, which Van Kirk echoed in her Monday statement to CNN, there is no public evidence that Harris pressured the Justice Department to prosecute Trump or her other opponents. The decision to bring two criminal cases against Trump – one over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and one over his post-presidency retention of classified documents – was made by a special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland.Trump made many public calls for investigations and prosecutions of political opponentsOn some occasions, Trump’s calls for investigations, arrests or prosecutions of his political opponentssoundedmore like vague gripesthan sincere attempts to prompt official action. On numerous occasions, though, Trump applied explicit, sustained public pressure on the Justice Department in general or his attorney general to pursue his opponents.For example, in 2017 and 2018, Trump frequently harangued then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions in tweets and public remarks to investigate various allegations against Clinton.“Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes,” hewrotein one tweet. “So where is the investigation A.G.,” hewrotein another tweet. “So many people are asking why isn’t the A.G. or Special Council (sic) looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes,” hewrotein another tweet. Inyet anothertweet, he noted allegations about Clinton, then wrote that “at some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper.”Trump made a directpublic requestin 2019 for Ukraine and China to launch investigations into Joe Biden and Hunter Biden – after he was already facing criticism forprivately pressuring Ukraine to investigate them. And in 2020, Trumppublicly demandedthat then-Attorney General William Barr indict Joe Biden, Obama and unspecified others over their supposed roles in the investigation into his 2016 campaign’s links to Russia.“Unless Bill Barr indicts these people for crimes, the greatest political crime in the history of our country, then we’re going to get little satisfaction unless I win and we’ll just have to go – because I won’t forget it. But these people should be indicted. This was the greatest political crime in the history of our country. And that includes Obama and it includes Biden,” Trumpsaid.Trump privately pressured the Justice DepartmentTrump suggested in that Fox News interview that he might have raised the subject of Biden and Obama indictments with Barr, saying, “I’ll be honest with you, he’s got all the information he needs. They want to get more, more, more, they keep getting more. I said, ‘You don’t need any more. You’ve got more stuff than anybody’s ever had.’”Trump privately pressured the Justice Department and Trump administration officials to go after other political opponents, according to former officials and news reports. And it appears he was sometimes successful, though it’s impossible to definitively prove a direct relationship between his demands and the department’s actions.Sessionstold special counsel Robert Muellerthat Trump pressured him in 2017 to abandon hisrecusalfrom investigations related to the 2016 election in order to prosecute Clinton, according to the Mueller report. Sessions did not do that, but heannounced in March 2018that he had (in November 2017) appointed a federal prosecutor to look into a variety of allegations against Clinton. She wasnever charged.The New York Timesreported this yearthat in April 2018, Trump told aides that if Sessions didn’t prosecute Clinton and Comey, Trump would prosecute them himself – prompting his White House counsel to write him a memo outlining the limits of the president’s powers.Boltonwrotein a 2020 book that Trump was “obsessed” with having Kerry prosecuted for supposedlybreaking a rarely enforced old lawbyremaining in contactwith Iranian officials after leaving office to try to preserve the nuclear agreement Kerry helped to negotiate. Bolton wrote that “in meeting after meeting in the Oval (Office), Trump would ask Attorney General William Barr or anybody listening to launch a prosecution.”The same week in 2018 that Trump tweeted that Kerry might have broken the law, the Justice Department assigned federal prosecutors to investigate Kerry,according to a bookby former federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman, who wasousted by Trump in 2020. Then, the same day Trump tweeted about Kerry in 2019, a Justice Department official called one of the prosecutors to apply more pressure over the case, Berman wrote. Kerry was never charged.In 2019, Barr satisfied Trump’s investigate-the-investigators demand bytaskinga federal prosecutor to help investigate the origins of the FBI’s probe related to Russia and the 2016 election. In late 2020, with about three months left in Trump’s presidency, Barr gave that prosecutor, John Durham,the status of special counsel.And in early 2020, Barrtaskeda different federal prosecutor with taking in information from members of the public,notably including then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, related to allegations about the Bidens and Ukraine, which had been a subject of Trump’s public and private focus.","Score: 1

cnn,"Fact check: During speech in which he used teleprompters, Trump falsely claims he doesn’t use teleprompters",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/11/politics/fact-check-harris-univision-teleprompter-false/index.html,"WashingtonCNN—Former President Donald Trump falsely claimed at a Friday rally that Vice President Kamala Harris used a teleprompter during her Univision town hall on Thursday. Univision itself debunked that claim on Thursday night.Trump also made a false claim that he doesn’t use teleprompters himself. In reality, Trump regularly uses teleprompters for his speeches and, as usual, hadone visible to his left and one visible to his rightduring this very speech.Trumpsaidat the Friday rally in Aurora, Colorado: “Did you see where she did a town hall yesterday and she used a teleprompter? I never saw a town – they never – you don’t use teleprompters, we don’t use teleprompters, period, pretty much. You don’t use ‘em for town halls.”Facts First:Trump’s claims are both wrong. The moderator of the Univision town hall and the president of Univision News both refuted the claim that Harris used a teleprompter at the town hall, noting Thursday that the teleprompter that was seen on the broadcast had text in Spanish, not English, and that it was material for the moderator, not Harris. And Trump uses teleprompters for most of his speeches, though he also regularly ad-libs additional remarks.The false claim that Harris used a teleprompter at the town hall generated millions of views on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. It was made by several right-wing commentators with significant followings, includingBenny Johnson,Charlie Kirk,Greg Priceand Fox News host Sean Hannity.Univision News president Daniel Coronell, responding to Price’s claim that “Kamala is using a teleprompter during her ‘town hall’ with Univision,”wroteon X: “That’s not true. The teleprompter that displays a text written in Spanish was a support element for the town hall moderator. I can tell you this with first-hand knowledge because I was in charge of the television program.”Town hall moderator Enrique Acevedo, responding to Johnson’s claim that “Univision accidentally broadcast proof that Kamala used a teleprompter at her town hall,”wroteon X: “The prompter displayed my introduction (in Spanish) and then it switched to a timer. Any claim to the contrary is simply untrue.”Acevedo and Coronell both posted their debunkings late Thursday night, but the viral posts from Price, Johnson and Kirk remained online as of 4 p.m. on Friday; Hannity deleted his post. Price, Johnson and Kirk did not respond to CNN requests for comment on Friday.Trump has made teleprompter-related comments a staple of his recent criticism of Harris as he has insulted her intelligence. Last month, hefalsely claimedthat Harris used notes in a televised interview with CNN.The right-wing commentators’ inaccurate posts claiming Harris used a teleprompter at the Univision town hall relied on a 12-second clip that was posted Thursday by the Trump campaign’s “Trump War Room” account. The campaign did not make an explicit claim in itsown post; rather, it simply wrote, “The teleprompter” and added an emoji of big eyes.Its allies did the rest.","Score: -1

cnn,"In Colin Allred, Ted Cruz once again facing a well-funded Democratic challenger in reelection fight",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/texas-senate-race-ted-cruz/index.html,"Waxahachie, TexasCNN—On a sunny October afternoon, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz posed for photos with supporters next to his campaign bus in downtown Waxahachie – a historic square complete with quaint shops and a storied, almost mythical-looking courthouse.The city is the seat of conservative Ellis County, directly south of Dallas and named after one of the leaders who helped Texas declare its independence from Mexico in 1836. Cruz had just delivered a fiery speech in an old playhouse across the street called the Texas Theater, where he rallied the crowd with red-meat rhetoric and jokes appealing to the state’s unique sense of pride.“We were founded by a bunch of wildcatters,” he said onstage in jeans and boots. “A bunch of guys with fourth-grade educations who began drilling holes in the ground and one after the other became the richest men on Earth. That’s Texas! Texas is: Give me an open field and a horse and a gun, and I can conquer the world.”Ranked one of the most conservative senators, Cruz’s bid for a third term should be a smooth ride in a place that has consistently elected Republicans in statewide contests for the past 30 years. But for the second election in a row, Cruz finds himself fighting to keep his seat against a well-funded Democrat.Rep. Colin Allred is a former NFL linebacker and civil rights lawyer who ousted a Republican for a US House seat six years ago. He’s now challenging Cruz and painting the incumbent senator as an unlikeable politician who cares more about podcasting than about legislating.Florida Sen. Rick Scott, left, and Texas Sen. Ted CruzGetty ImagesRelated articleSenate Democrats launch first multimillion-dollar TV investments in Texas and Florida as map grows more dauntingRecent polls suggest a tightening race, one reminiscent of when Democrat Beto O’Rourke lost to Cruz in 2018 by less than 3 percentage points in a campaign that caught the country’s attention. National Democratic groups are again investing heavily in TV ads, stirring up an all-too-familiar hope they can pull off a massive upset, though many remain skeptical.Both men describe themselves as serious legislators who can work across the aisle, while at the same time, blast each other as radical candidates out of touch with Texas voters. The ad wars on TV further highlight a stark contrast between two emerging yet competing ideas of the Texas electorate – a longtime conservative force or an evolving landscape with increasingly Democratic strongholds.The latter of which is a reality casting a shadow on Cruz’s campaign – most notably when he urges voters on his 53-city tour to vote for Republicans up and down the ticket.“This race comes down to one very simple thing,” he says in his stump speech, “keeping Texas Texas.”The issues: Economy, the border and transgender policiesIn the final weeks before the election, both candidates are blitzing across the state to drill home their closing message. They’re also set to duel in a televised debate Tuesday,hosted by CNN affiliate WFAA.That’s on top of the massive amount of money spent on ads in the state’s abundant and expensive media markets. The two campaigns and their allied groups have spent nearly $129 million, including future ad buys through Election Day, according to data from AdImpact, making it one of the eight most expensive Senate races this cycle. Allred and groups supporting him have spent nearly two-thirds of that total, while Cruz and his supporters have spent the other third.Sen. Ted Cruz addresses supporters during a campaign event on October 5 in Keller, Texas.Julio Cortez/APCruz has largely aimed his attacks on Allred regarding three issues: the economy, the US southern border and transgender policies. He’s released multiple TV ads pointing to Allred’s vote against a GOP-led House bill last year that would have banned transgender athletes from women’s and girls’ sports at federally funded schools. The bill,which passed on a party-line vote, was not taken up by the Senate.On the campaign trail, Cruz makes the topic a prominent part of his stump speech. “We are living in a world where one of the two major parties right now cannot figure out what is a woman,” he said. “That didn’t use to be a trick question.”Allred became the first Democrat this election cycle to release an ad responding to the barbs over transgender issues – a key line of attack by Republicans in the presidential race and other congressional races.“Ted Cruz is lying again, but now he’s lying about our children. I’m a dad. I’m also a Christian,” Allred says in a new ad. “And my faith has taught me that all kids are God’s kids. So let me be clear: I don’t want boys playing girls sports or any of this ridiculous stuff that Ted Cruz is saying.”CNN has asked Allred’s campaign to clarify his stance more precisely but has not received a response.From left, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Lori Chavez-DeRemerThe Washington Post/Getty ImagesRelated articleTwo House incumbents seek to woo the other party’s voters in Pacific Northwest swing seatsCruz also criticizes Allred for changing his tune on the southern border. While running for Congress in 2018, Allredreferred to the border wall as “racist,”and as recently as two years ago said he didn’t see the border as a “top-of-mind” issue for a lot of voters in Texas, though he said he wanted to see comprehensive immigration reform.He’s now making the border a focal point in his ads, vowing to fix the issue and attacking Cruz for opposing the bipartisan immigration bill earlier this year. Allred also joined with Republicans this year to condemn the “Biden administration’s open-borders policies” in a GOP-led resolution.On the campaign trail, where the border is a winning issue for Republicans, Cruz has repeatedly called out Allred for standing in front of the same border wall that the representative criticized years ago in one of his TV ads and has questioned Allred’s seriousness about the border.In an interview with CNN, Allred defended his position, acknowledging that he and his party took “too long to be responsive to what was a rising tide of migration.”“But we can also say the response can’t be ‘Let’s be cruel to people and think that’s gonna help.’ That’s not actual border security,” he said.Meanwhile, Allred is hitting Cruz hard over abortion, arguing the senator is “responsible” for the overturning of Roe v. Wade by helping put judges and justices in federal courts, leading to the landmark decision by the Supreme Court in 2022.“With Ted Cruz, we get more government and less freedom, and Texas women pay the price,” the narrator says in one of Allred’s ads.While Cruz has celebrated the Supreme Court ruling as a major victory, he’s remained quiet recently about his stance on Texas’abortion laws, which don’t include exceptions for rape or incest. Asked by CNN why he didn’t mention abortion in his stump speech after a rally in Allen, Cruz argued it’s not a top concern for Texas voters and changed the subject to jobs and the border. In another gaggle with reporters the following day, he said it was an issue for state leaders to decide.‘Republicans for Allred’Both candidates tout their bipartisanship, but Allred is leaning heavily into his support from high-profile Republicans such as former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who leads a group called “Republicans for Allred.”Allred brings up their endorsements often, mentioning their names more frequently than Vice President Kamala Harris’. Asked by CNN about that strategy, Allred said he doesn’t think Texas voters view his race and the presidential race in the same light.Rep. Colin Allred speaks during a campaign event that saw volunteers man phones on October 3, in San Antonio, Texas.Brandon Bell/Getty Images“I do think that there are Texans out there who are actual conservatives and who believe in the rule of law, who believe in the Constitution, who believe we shouldn’t try and overturn elections, who think that, you know, they don’t want to be embarrassed anymore by their senator,” he said.Cruz finds Cheney’s support laughable. “I’ve known Liz Cheney a long time, and she’s completely lost her mind,” he told CNN when asked about her endorsement.Allred’s effort to cement his brand as a moderate is one key difference from O’Rourke’s campaign in 2018. And while O’Rourke crisscrossed the state with large, energetic rallies, Allred has spent much of the race holding smaller, more intimate events, while spending big – and early – on TV ads to boost his name recognition. In these final weeks, Allred is starting to do bigger events, urging people to get out the vote.O’Rourke also refrained from going negative against Cruz, but Allred isn’t holding back punches. Several of his ads show video of Cruz at the airport on his infamous trip to Cancun during the deadly 2021 Texas freeze that left the state in a standstill for days. Cruz called the trip amistake when he returned, but he has since joked about it.At a campaign event last week with the “Funky East Dallas Democrats,” Allred railed against Cruz’s intentions as a serious legislator, poking fun at his thrice-weekly podcast, blaming him in part for the January 6, 2021, insurrection, and knocking him on abortion.But in his closing line, Allred asked the crowd to remember Cruz’s Cancun suitcase as they watch the results come in on Election Day.“Imagine Cruz taking that same little roller bag and walking right out of the Capitol,” he said.CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report.","Score: 0

cnn,House Republicans attempt to avoid 2022 letdown with new tactic on abortion: ‘We’re both pro-choice’,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/house-republicans-abortion-strategy-elections/index.html,"For more on the House Republican strategy on abortion issues, watch CNN’s “Inside Politics with Manu Raju,” this Sunday at 8 a.m. ET.﻿WashingtonCNN—Republicans in the nation’s toughest House districts are making a major pivot on abortion with a surprising result — they’re starting to sound like Democrats.GOP candidates in suburbs of places like Tucson, Des Moines and Syracuse are going public with vows never to criminalize abortion or support a national ban. Some are going further: Rep.John Duarteof California’s Central Valley, Rep. Tom Kean Jr. in northern New Jersey and GOP candidate Matt Gunderson in the San Diego area have all described themselves as “pro choice” — with the latter even speaking directly to camera in his first TV ad and borrowing Bill Clinton’s phrase calling for the procedure to be “safe, legal and rare.”In this fall’s toss-up battle for the House, swing-seat Republicans are carefully rebranding themselves on abortion after largely failing to respond to relentless Democratic attacks that cost the GOP big last cycle. And they’re attempting to neutralize the Democrats’ most potent attack — all in an effort to turn voters’ attention to the US-Mexico border and other galvanizing issues.“Since we’re both pro-choice, then we have an opportunity to take that conversation, set it aside and have a real serious conversation about solving the border, about inflation, the economy, jobs, crime, education,” Gunderson said in an interview, referring to his opponent, Democratic Rep. Mike Levin.It may be easier said than done.Even as swing-seat Republicans attempt to paint a more nuanced view of the GOP’s stance on abortion, the national party has often muddled that message. In recent days, former first lady Melania Trump disclosed she supports the right to an abortion “free from any intervention” — while Donald Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, took the staunchly conservative position of vowing to defund Planned Parenthood.And it all underscores a critical weakness for the GOP fewer than 30 days from the election. The party still struggles to respond to an issue that makes up the vast majority of Democratic attacks this cycle: 80% of spending on TV ads by the House Democrats’ two main groups went to ads focusing on abortion. And it’s been particularly effective against GOP incumbents with well-documented comments on abortion — like Rep. Zach Nunn of Iowa — that Democrats have turned into attack ads.“You can’t hide from it,” said Rep. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican from North Dakota, reflecting on the lessons Republicans learned in the 2022 midterms. “We didn’t really have a plan for what had happened.”Democrats say their foes’ efforts to show a softer side on abortion won’t work.“He’s going to probably say anything he needs to say to try to win and see what sticks,” Levin, a three-term Democrat who cut an ad responding to Gunderson, told CNN.“We know that if Mike Johnson is empowered, that there are many around here that would try to get a national abortion ban in place,” Levin said, even as his opponent said he’d oppose both a national ban and a bill to codify Roe, saying the issue should be left up to the states.Behind closed doors, Republican leaders have spent months working with battleground candidates, particularly in New York and California, to sell a more moderate message on the issue. The House GOP campaign chief, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, has advised fellow Republicans to clearly articulate their views — or face globs of Democratic spending to distort their position.And they’ve been far more aggressive in calling out some misleading Democratic ads, which have accused Republican candidates of supporting strict abortion bans or opposing exceptions for abortion even when that candidate is on the record with a more moderate position. In some cases, like in pivotal seats inNorth CarolinaandVirginia, fact-checkers have agreed.Hudson accused Democrats of “creating a false and distorted impression” of the GOP’s abortion position in the 2022 midterms and attacked Democrats for espousing their own “extreme” views on the issue.“To fight back, we have encouraged our candidates to be open, direct and empathetic about their position – and nonpartisan fact-checkers have responded, picking apart a litany of Democratic attack ads for telling blatant lies,” Hudson told CNN.Sarah Chamberlain, who runs the centrist-leaning Republican Mainstreet Partnership, recalled warning a prominent GOP pollster the day of the Dobbs Supreme Court decision that it would be a huge issue for women voters. He initially told her she was wrong, but phoned her after the midterms to admit his miscalculation. Since then, Chamberlain has used her own polling to help convince key swing-seat House Republicans to shift their approach.“Don’t use the ‘A word.’ Talk about it as women’s health care,” Chamberlain said. “The economy, immigration — there’s tons of things we can win on and should win on. But this issue is still very strong.”Democrats cry hypocrisyIn some cases, Republicans are trying to walk back — or completely abandon — their past anti-abortion rights views.When he first ran for Congress in 2022 for a seat in Washington state, GOP candidate Joe Kenttold a local news station: “I would move to have a national ban on abortion.”This time, Kentfilmed an adstating: “I oppose any new federal legislation on the issue.”Kent’s opponent — Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez — called out his shifting position in a recentcandidate debate, accusing him of playing “both sides of this card” and saying “what the pollsters tell him to say.”And he’s not the only one whose public position has changed. Nunn, the endangered Republican in Iowa, is fighting for his political survival as Democrats devote a majority of their TV ads to the issue in this suburban battleground.Nunn’s Democratic opponent, Lanon Baccam, hasattacked the GOP incumbentwith a clip from the Republican primary debate in 2022 when Nunn raised his hand to say all abortions should be illegal in the country. Nunn has not responded to the issue of abortion on air.And in the key California race to hold Levin’s seat, the main Democratic super PAC — House Majority PAC — has reserved $1.5 million to begin next week in an effort to target Gunderson. Abortion attacks are expected to be part of the mix.Levin has seized on Gunderson’s opposition to a 2022 California abortion rights referendum, which the Republican previously referred to as “disgusting” in a meeting with voters.“What I did say was that late-term abortion is disgusting,” Gunderson told CNN when asked about those remarks, arguing the referendum “opened up a Pandora’s box to late-term abortion.”Democratic leaders say Republicans are trying to muddy the waters.“This is a desperation move by Republicans,” said House Democrats’ campaign chief, Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state. “People know where they stand.”Pro-women language but unclear on specificsIn 2022, Democrats dumped a half-billion dollars’ worth of abortion attacks into pivotal races and helped prevent a GOP wave. This time, Republicans, like freshman Rep. Marc Molinaro, who is defending a tough upstate New York seat, are looking to take that issue off the table for Democrats.Molinaro was one of the first Republicans this cycle to launch a TV ad devoted solely to his stance on abortion.“I believe in supporting all women and the choices they make,” Molinaro says, speaking into the camera, in the ad.But even as he has sought to counter Democratic attacks, he hasn’t been entirely clear on what positions he does support. While the New York Republican touted support for “broad access” to birth control and blocking efforts to ban mifepristone in an interview, he didn’t offer a clear answer when asked if he supports restoring Roe or if he considers himself “pro choice.”“I describe it as somebody who says that the decision and the choice on reproductive health is between you and your physician. Immaterial of anything else, that’s what I believe,” Molinaro told CNN. As for his decision to speak up on abortion, Molinaro added: “I think it’s important that people see me explain to them that I respect the choice they make and that they have my support.”He isn’t the only Republican looking to keep their distance from the Dobbs decision.Duarte, the vulnerable California Republican, refused to say if he supports the 2022 decision that struck down Roe.“It doesn’t matter. It’s done. It’s in the rearview mirror,” Duarte told CNN. “And the fact is that abortion is back in the states where it belongs.”And the congressman contended that his position — and Trump’s position — that the matter should be left up to the states is effectively pro-abortion rights.“I am pro-choice,” Duarte said, arguing that Trump is even “functionally pro-choice,” though the former president regularly boasts about appointing three Supreme Court justices who struck down Roe and plans to vote against a Florida abortion rights referendum this fall.Another battleground Republican, Rep. Juan Ciscomani of southern Arizona, went up with his own TV ad this fall saying he opposes a federal abortion ban and supports abortion in the cases of certain exceptions, such as protecting the life of the mother.In adebatethis week, Ciscomani added that he also opposed his state’s Civil War-era ban on nearly all abortions, which was recently repealed. But he didn’t say how he’ll vote this November on his state’s ballot measure to enshrine rights to an abortion up to the point of viability, saying only that it was a state issue.And when asked about what he was trying to sell to voters with his ad, Ciscomani simply said: “My position.”","I cannot provide a political bias score or analysis for this content without seeing the full original article.

cnn,Trump spread conspiracies on mail-in voting for years. Now his campaign is urging people to vote early and by mail,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/trump-mail-in-voting/index.html,"CNN—Donald Trump’s campaign is making a last-minute push to advocate for early and mail-in voting, methods the former president has falsely vilified for years as dangerous and fraudulent.With less than a month to go in a tight race, Trump’s campaign is urging people to vote early and by mail, while also working to expandvoting access in North Carolinaafter Hurricane Helene.In a series of recent virtual town halls and robocalls reviewed by CNN, Trump and his daughter-in-law Lara Trump, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee, have actively encouraged voters to take advantage of early voting options, including mail-in ballots.“Hi, this is Lara Trump calling on behalf of President Trump’s campaign, and we’re urging you to get out and vote before Election Day,”one robocallsays. Earlier this year, LaraTrump voiced a robocallfalsely alleging massive fraud in the 2020 election due to mail-in ballots.The Trump campaign taps Lara Trump to encourage voters to vote early and by mailEarlier this year, the RNC co-chair voiced a robocall falsely alleging massive fraud occurred in the 2020 election due to mail ballots.Source: NomoroboAt least 286,000 estimated robocalls with this recording were sent to voters, including in the key swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada and Michigan, according to data fromNomorobo, an app that blocks and tracks robocalls. The calls began as early as October 2.The Trump campaign this past week also asked North Carolina to take steps to expand voting access in the wake of damage from Hurricane Helene – even asRepublicans in Georgia opposed an effortto expand voting access by extending registration deadlines following hurricane damage in that state.Lara Trump, daughter-in-law of former President Donald Trump, speaks at the Republican National Committee spring meeting on March 8, 2024, in Houston.Cecile Clocheret/AFP/Getty ImagesVoting rights advocates, while happy to see the Trump campaign join in a bipartisan push for expanded voting access, note that it cuts against a lengthy record of trying to restrict voting in this election and in 2020, when the pandemic upended voting across the country.“It’s great that the Trump campaign was speaking with the same voice as so many others and asking for expansions to voting access in the wake of Hurricane Helene,” said Sean Morales-Doyle, the director of the voting rights program at the Brennan Center for Justice. “But it does trouble me that they don’t take a sort of uniform approach to that – or to mail voting or to early voting.”In 2020, the Trump campaign filed several lawsuits to stop many of the changes made by states to make it easier to vote by mail. The changes were put in place to reduce indoor gatherings during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.“When you see this flip-flopping on voting, not only does it raise the concern that these policies are based on the politics of who they think will benefit from expanded access … it also makes clear that they know they’re not telling the truth on how expanded access from mail voting or early voting contribute to a denigration of election integrity,” Morales-Doyle added.North Carolina is one of the key swing states that could decide the presidential election, and the western part of the stateaffected most by the hurricaneis some of the most solid territory for Trump.Of the 25 counties in North Carolina’s federally declared disaster area, the former president won all but two in 2020, with nearly 63% of the vote. According to the state’s board of elections, there are 481,000 registered Republicans in the 25 counties, compared with 293,000 Democrats.Trump campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement that the proposals to expand voting access in North Carolina “will ensure the people who have already suffered from the storm don’t lose their right to participate in this important election.”“Swift action from the North Carolina General Assembly and the Governor will ensure the people of their state have their voices heard on November 5th,” they said.‘Too big to rig’Trump has previouslyreleased videosand messageson his social mediapromoting early and mail-in voting as part of the Republican National Committee’s get-out-the-vote program. Both methods of voting are promoted at Trump’s campaign rallies.But that push has at times led to conflicting messaging from the former president.Last month, at a rally inIndiana, Pennsylvania, Trump disparaged early voting, and promoted it, in the same breath.“We got to get out and vote. And you can start right away. You know that, right? Now we have this stupid stuff where you can vote 45 days early. I wonder what the hell happens during that 45. ‘Let’s move, see these votes? We’ve got about a million votes in there. Let’s move them. We’re fixing the air conditioner in the room, right?’ No, it’s terrible,” Trump said. “What happened the last time was disgraceful, including right here. But we’re not going to let it happen again. You know, too big to rig, right? That’s one way you do it.”In 2020, Trump called mail-in ballots “dangerous” and “corrupt.” Hesaid they’dlead to “massive electoral fraud” and a “rigged” 2020 election.Now locked in a tight election against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s campaign is actively promoting early in-person and mail voting, even as the former president pledged to one day eliminate the commonly used practices. He falsely implied they were insecure voting methods in a Junevideo posted to Swamp the Vote USA, a voting resource website paid for by the Republican National Committee.Former President Donald Trump speaks at the Detroit Economic Club on October 10, 2024.Bill Pugliano/Getty Images“I will once and for all secure our elections. We’re going to go to paper ballots. We’re going to have same-day voting, voter ID. We’re going to do it properly. We’re going to have good, secure, beautiful elections. We never want what happened in 2020 to happen again,” Trump says directly to the camera. “But until then, Republicans must win. And we must use every appropriate tool available to beat the Democrats. … Whether you vote early, absentee, by mail or in person, we’re going to protect the vote.”The Republican parties in Arizona and Nevada also tapped Lara Trump to voice robocalls promoting early and mail voting, despite previously echoing her father-in-law’s rhetoric on early voting.“With your help, we’re going to secure a massive victory in Nevada,” Lara Trump says on the Nevada robocall. “So, get out there, encourage others to vote early and remind them just how critical this election is. When we vote, we win.”Lara Trump encourages Nevada voters to vote early and by mailThe Nevada Republican Party tapped Lara Trump to encourage Nevadans to vote early and by mail.Source: NomoroboIn April,CNN’s KFile reportedLara Trump sent out a scripted call to voters’ phones saying Democrats committed “massive fraud” in the 2020 election.“We all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and noncitizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,”the RNC call from April said. “If Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn’t even an American citizen.”Pushing North Carolina to expand accessOn Tuesday, the Trump campaign issued astatement proposing 10 policy changesfor North Carolina to help voters in areas hit by Hurricane Helene, some of which were enacted by the state legislature.The Republican-led legislature’s bill, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper on Thursday, gave the 25 counties in the federally declared disaster area additional flexibility to run their elections. The law contains provisions similar to several of Trump’s proposals, including giving counties more flexibility on early voting hours and allowing counties to use temporary voting locations if precincts are unusable.Destroyed homes are seen in Chimney Rock, North Carolina, on October 2, 2024, after the passage of Hurricane Helene.Allison Joyce/AFP/Getty Images“I will give the Republicans who are in charge here credit for passing good legislation (Wednesday) that definitely will address needs of voters,” said Bob Phillips, the executive director of Common Cause North Carolina, a group that advocates for expanded voter access. “The biggest thing is giving each of these county board of elections the flexibility with regards to voting sites, both for early voting and Election Day.”The Trump campaign also proposed expanding bipartisan teams to help voters request and deliver absentee ballots to county boards and allowing voters displaced to other counties in the state to cast provisional ballots that would be delivered back to their home county.In Georgia, however,where Helene also caused significant damage, Republicans opposed an attempt to expand voter access. The Republican National Committee intervened as a defendant in a lawsuit brought by civil rights groups to extend the county’s voter registration deadline, which was Monday.A federal judge on Thursdaydenied that motion, saying it “lacked clarity and detail” as to how specific individuals were harmed.A similar lawsuit over the voter registration deadline in Florida – which is still determining the damage inflicted byHurricane Milton– was also dismissed by a federal judge on Wednesday.An RNC spokesperson said liberal groups in Georgia were trying to use the courts to extend registration deadlines enacted by the legislature, when voters have had months to register to vote in Georgia.“As many Americans are still reeling from the impact of Hurricane Helene, the Trump Campaign and RNC are fighting to expand voting access for those displaced, and we are meeting voters where they are to ensure they are educated on voting changes,” said RNC spokesperson Anna Kelly.Trump and his allies have argued there’s a difference in changes approved by a legislature – like the campaign asked North Carolina to do – and many of the changes that were made in 2020 by election boards during the pandemic.Voting rights advocates say while the circumstances are different between a pandemic and a hurricane, the idea of allowing displaced voters to participate in an election should be the same.“Even to the extent these disasters cause different hurdles, the policy solutions are often the same,” said Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center. “Expanded access is key, and in order to expand access, funding is key. The things we’re advocating for right now in North Carolina and Florida, in many ways, echo the things we were advocating for in 2020.”","Score: 0

cnn,Postmaster general says ballots should be mailed in at least a week before Election Day,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/post-office-mail-in-voting-dejoy/index.html,"CNN—Postmaster General Louis DeJoy pledged Thursday that the US Postal Service will undertake “heroic efforts” to deliver all mail-in ballots on time this year and urged people to put their ballots in the mail at least one week before Election Day on November 5.“Let me be clear, the Postal Service is ready to deliver the nation’s mail-in ballots,” DeJoy said at a news conference, held as a bipartisan group of election officials recently raised concerns about the delivery of mail ballots and former President Donald Trump repeats some of his debunked false claims about supposed fraud with mail-in voting.“We encourage the voting public to mail early if they chose to vote by mail,” he said.USPS will work “around the clock” and implement “extraordinary measures” to ensure the timely delivery of mail-in voting, DeJoy said. Arecord43% of voters cast mail ballots in 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic. The level isn’t expected to be as high this year, but many states across the country haveexpandedthe availability of mail-in voting.These special measures include designated lines at post offices for people with ballots, extra deliveries and collections by letter-carriers, “after-hours” drop-offs to election offices, and keeping processing facilities open on the Sunday before Election Day.The postmaster general tiptoed around a question from CNN about Trump’s recent social media post, implicitly rebuking the former president without mentioning his name.“My response is like my response to everyone who says we’re not prepared for the election – it is that they’re wrong,” DeJoy said. “I don’t know that I need to comment any more than that. They’re wrong.”“For a variety of reasons, there is a heightened sensitivity and scrutiny across the entire vote-by-mail ecosystem,” DeJoy also said. “…The American public will become increasingly alarmed if there is ongoing dialogue that continues to question the reliability of the Postal Service for the upcoming elections.”Lyingaboutmail-in votingwas acenterpieceof Trump’s 2020 campaign, and as the 2024 race reaches the final stretch, he hasresurrectedmany of thesefalse claims.In a social media post on Sunday, Trump claimed without evidence that USPS “admitted that it is a poorly run mess.” And Trump claimed in a recent interview with a right-wing radio host that USPS will “lose hundreds of thousands of ballots, maybe purposely.”Despite Trump’s claims, voter fraud is extremely rare in US elections, according to studies from liberal and conservative groups, and the expansion of mail-in voting doesn’t automatically benefit Democrats over Republicans. But since 2020, Trump’sincessant attackson the practice hasmade it much less popularamong GOP voters.The USPSsaysduring the 2020 election, which was conducted amid the Covid-19 pandemic, it delivered nearly 99% of ballots from voters to election officials within seven days. DeJoy has said “we take great pride” in how USPS handled the 2020 election, whenthereweremajorcontroversiesandlawsuitsregarding delivery of mail-in ballots.DeJoy becamepostmaster general in June 2020after being selected by the USPS Board of Governors. All six members of the bipartisan board were appointed by Trump.Engaging with local officialsThe National Association of Secretaries of State, an umbrella organization that represents election officials from both parties, started raising alarm bells earlier this month when it senta letterto DeJoy expressing “ongoing concerns” about the postal service’s “ability to deliver election mail in a timely and accurate manner” this year.Specifically, the election officials said they’ve experienced “exceptionally long delivery times” for election mail, including ballots, which could lead to those ballots getting rejected because they didn’t arrive before the deadline. They also wrote that they’ve noticed “higher than usual rates” of election-related mail being marked as undeliverable.“Despite repeated engagement” with USPS officials who handle election mail, “we have not seen improvement or concerted efforts to remediate our concerns,” the letter said.DeJoy said Thursday he is a “pretty accessible executive” and would step up coordination with the election officials during the final stretch of the campaign.“I have agreed to stay more in contact with them,” DeJoy said, regarding the National Association of Secretaries of State. “I procedurally directed our regional team to be more integrated into meeting with our operational teams as we move forward, so we can more rapidly respond to issues as we get the specifics of those issues.”","Score: 0

cnn,"Arizona Supreme Court rules voters caught in proof-of-citizenship glitch can still get ‘full ballot,’ including state races",https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/politics/arizona-supreme-court-citizenship-voting/index.html,"CNN—The Arizona Supreme Court ruled Friday that nearly 100,000 residentswho may not have fulfilled the state’s proof-of-citizenship requirementscan still vote in state and local races this year, quickly resolving how election officials should address a clerical glitch that had left in question the eligibility of those registered voters in  the critical battleground state.The court was asked to decide whether these voters should get a “federal-only” ballot or the “full ballot,” which would also include state and local races. Regardless of the outcome, these voters would have been able to cast presidential ballots.Arizona uses these separate ballots because the state requires all voters to prove their citizenship before they can vote in state and local races. Such documentation isn’t required to cast ballots for federal office in Arizona.The decision to let these roughly 98,000 voters use the full ballot is a victory for Arizona’s Democratic secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, and liberal groups that pushed for this outcome.The Arizona Supreme Court ruled just three days after the lawsuit was filed. Election officials hoped a quick resolution of the issue would reduce confusion heading into voting season.Besides state and local races, the ruling could also affect Arizona’sreferendumon abortion rights this fall.Maricopa County RecorderStephen Richer, a Republican, filed the lawsuit Tuesday against Fontes, arguing that the nearly 98,000 voters should receive the federal-only ballot. But Richer had said his bigger priority was getting speedy clarity from the courts.“Thank God,” Richerpostedon social media in response to Friday’s ruling. “Thank you Arizona Supreme Court for your extremely quick and professional review of this matter.”In a show of bipartisanship, Richer and Fontes thanked each other for collaboratively tackling the unexpected pre-election issue. Fontes said election officials would work to fix the clerical error after the election, including outreach to the affected voters asking them to update their citizenship records.“Today marks a significant victory for those whose fundamental right to vote was under scrutiny,” Fontes said. “The court faced a stark choice: to allow voters to participate in just a few federal races on a limited ballot, or to make their voices heard across hundreds of decisions on a full ballot that includes a variety of local and state offices. We deeply appreciate the Arizona Supreme Court for their prompt and just resolution.”Arizona officials previously said a glitch miscategorized nearly 98,000 people in the state’s voter rolls as having provided proof of citizenship – even though there is no record of that happening. Those voters got their driver’s license before 1996, which is the year Arizona started requiring residents to prove their citizenship to obtain a license.Former President Donald Trump and hisRepublican allieshave raisedbaselessclaims thatmassive numbersof noncitizens have voted in US elections, and Trump used this case to continue his yearslong pattern of using routine mishaps and errors in the voting process to allege widespread fraud. Nonpartisan experts say illegal voting by noncitizens is extremely rare and is quickly caught.This story has been updated with additional reporting.CNN’s Tierney Sneed and Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report.","Score: 0

cnn,Biden’s clean energy law revived this red corner of Georgia. Voters there are backing Trump anyway,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/27/politics/dalton-georgia-trump-voters-biden-climate-law/index.html,"Dalton, GeorgiaCNN—Theface of a new erain American manufacturing is here, just off Interstate 75, tucked into this northwest corner of Georgia.That’s where you’ll find the Qcells plant that pumps out 32,000 solar panels a day and has a total panel production capacity of 5.1 gigawatts. For context, officials note, the peak capacity of the Hoover Dam is roughly 2 gigawatts.“When I came here, there was dirt. There was no building,” said Lisa Nash, the plant manager here, walking CNN through the high-tech factory floor in August. “I was the first person hired.”Asked if she could have envisioned where things are now, she didn’t hesitate: “No.”In Nash’s view, the dramatic growth isn’t just a success story for the company or industry, it’s also major win for the community here in Dalton.“The population’s growing. They’re buying houses, rent, shopping, eating out. They’re contributing back into the local community, paying taxes,” Nash said.It’s a cutting-edge operation that was made possible by thesweeping climate investment lawenacted by the Biden administration in 2022.“We’ve had lots of support in the state and federal level of various kinds,” said Scott Moskowitz, the head of market strategy and public affairs at Qcells. “But it wasn’t till the Inflation Reduction Act passed, which really provided the spark that this industry needed to make these types of investments.”Vice President Kamala Harris visits the Qcells solar panel manufacturing plant in Dalton, Georgia, on April 6, 2023.Andi Rice/CNP//Bloomberg/Getty Images/FileWhich is why Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to the plant last year to highlight its growth – and speak to some of its employees.“To meet her and to have a conversation with her, I was shocked because I was thinking, you know, she’s up here, but she’s actually down to earth, very straightforward,” said Kimberly Richardson, the Qcells employee selected by management to introduce Harris during her visit.A view of the Ultium Cell factory in Warren, Ohio, July 7, 2023.Gene J. Puskar/AP/FileRelated articleAn EV plant bolstered by Biden’s climate law sparks hope in Northeast Ohio – but not a revival of its Democratic rootsRichardson embodies a new generation of manufacturing workers – someone with no experience in solar panels or the green technology space prior to joining Qcells who has quickly acclimated – and risen – inside the company, where she’s now in charge of the plant’s recycling operation.For Richardson, a Black woman, Harris’ campaign for president carries a deep meaning.“She represents every woman in the United States, every woman,” Richardson said. “She set the tone for every woman in the United States, every little girl, to say, ‘I can do this,’ and that’s a good thing.”But while Georgia may be a hotly contested battleground state, Richardson’s view isn’t exactly widespread here, where support for formerPresident Donald Trumpruns strong.“She wasn’t well received in north Georgia,” Kasey Carpenter, the Republican state representative for the area, said of the Harris visit.The Qcells plant offers a window into the convergence of local, state and federal government aligning to accelerate a manufacturing transition that has turbocharged a local economy. That the effort has crossed party lines is rare enough in these polarized times.But that it happened in a community that backs a presidential candidate who has attacked the very law that is central to its rapid expansion underscores the complex – and in this case, contradictory - overlap of politics and a local economy.The Qcells solar panel plant in Dalton, GeorgiaCNNTrump strikes a chordLocated in the congressional district represented by GOP firebrandMarjorie Taylor Greene, Dalton is Trump country.“The independence that we keep up here – it’s that independence and outsider that he’s really struck a chord with,” Carpenter said of Trump’s rock-solid support in the area. “And my folks, they appreciate that. And quite frankly that I appreciate that too.”Carpenter is far from a die-hard Trump supporter.“We’re in a world where we get two candidates, but we have 27 boxes of cereal on the shelf. That’s the world I live in,” he said. “It’s that frustrating that you have two candidates.”But for voters here, the political debate over the economy comes down to one thing.“Inflation is such a big issue for our community right now that that’s going to trump anything that kind of I think about,” Carpenter said.George state Rep. Kasey CarpenterCNNThis is the paradox playing out during a dramatic comeback for this part of the state.The Qcells plant – the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere – sits in what has long been known as the carpet capital of the world.The moniker can be found on the signs welcoming visitors to Dalton, which has held a dominant market share of the carpet and flooring industry for decades.But it also left the area particular vulnerable to something most thought was impossible until 2008: a housing market crash.“It was a bloodbath for us here,” Carpenter said. “It was a ghost town. And it took us years to get out of it.”The market collapse sparked local leaders to start thinking through – and setting up the infrastructure for – the diversification of the town’s economy.That overlapped with efforts at the state level – most recently by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp – to line up incentives for major companies to relocate to or build in Georgia.The Biden administration’s incentives from the federal side turbocharged the efforts on green energy.“They are all equally important,” Nash said when asked whose support was most critical between federal, state and local government. “It’s like a recipe and without one ingredient, you can’t successfully have this project.”The result has been the revival of a model that was thought to be a thing of the past.“If you walk around in the factory, you’re going see a broad age band,” Nash said. “We have a 65-year-old father. His son and his daughter work here. There are high school students that we interview because of their gaming.”What was once aspirational is now reality – and growing.‘A hometown feel’Just about 50 miles down I-75 is Cartersville, where on a recent Saturday the center of town was jam-packed with residents stopping through booths filled by local vendors selling locally sourced food and agricultural goods.For two years running, this has been ranked the top farmer’s market in Georgia, which might not be expected in a county that voted 75% for Trump in 2020.Cartersville, Georgia, Mayor Matt Santini talks with CNN's Phil Mattingly at the town's farmer's market.CNNBut in some ways, it’s a key element to an approach that helped the town lure Qcells to build its next plant here, just a few miles away from where CNN linked up with its mayor, Matt Santini.This is clearly a Republican town, with deep-rooted support for the former president. But in Santini’s mind, the true nature of the place is the community itself.“It’s doubled in size since I moved here in the early ‘90s, but it’s still a place where, again, you can walk through a farmer’s market,” Santini said. “You see people talking and getting along with each other. We have a hometown feel.”CNNvideoRelated videoPoll shows Trump has edge with voters on this key issueBack in Dalton, that hometown feel is exactly the vibe a visitor gets walking into the Oakwood Cafe.The restaurant is technically the day job for Carpenter, the state legislator – and one that keeps him connected to the community he represents while in Atlanta when the Legislature is in session.“I’m real connected,” Carpenter said with a chuckle. “I fry their chicken on Monday, and Saturdays I’m washing their dishes.”Carpenter describes his community and its residents with pride.“It’s blue-collar, man. We’re all workers,” he said.But he acknowledges there’s a heavy dose of ideological irony in the economic engine that has taken root in the area over the past few years.“We’re growing the green energy that they don’t necessarily care that much about,” he said. “But I think they’re coming around because they see the impact on the economy.”That impact, he notes, has been significant.“Whether it’s janitorial, whether it’s restaurants, catering, whether it’s, you know, plastics, you know, garbage bags, whatever, shipping goods, all of that stuff flows downstream from something like that,” Carpenter said.An aerial view of Dalton, GeorgiaCNNThreats that haven’t resonatedThat downstream effect – perhaps most tangible in the form of downtown Dalton’s new boutique hotel, right across the street from the Oakwood Cafe, the area’s first in 50 years and evidence to many of the city’s comeback.Still, the campaign-trail threats from Trump to repeal pillars of the climate law that sparked the growth haven’t moved voters here – or really resonated.“I don’t think they realize that if the whole thing is repealed, it will affect those 2,500 jobs down on the south end of the county. And it’s real,” Carpenter said. “It will have consequences.”Qcells representatives are quick to point out that they first broke ground in Dalton in 2018 because Trump’s tariffs on solar panels incentivized production stateside.Still, the former president’s threats are impossible to ignore, even if the bipartisan support for the project across the federal, state and local levels offers it a level of protection should Trump win.“You want to ask me that after November?” Nash, the Qcells plant manager, responded when asked about the future for the industry.Lisa Nash, the Qcells plant manager, speaks with Mattingly.CNNBut she underscored the scale of the transformation already underway – and what that means for the future.“No, I’m optimistic because we’re just scratching the surface,” she said.It’s a future Nash’s parents thought didn’t exist.“Both of them said, ‘Don’t go into manufacturing,’” she recalled. “I’d like to think they’re both proud of me today because of this. I look at my kids and my grandkids, and I’m thinking: ‘I wouldn’t mind them doing that.’”It’s a window into a transformation that has taken hold of an entire community – a one-industry town no more.Asked if there were any plans to add “Solar capital of the world” onto the current Dalton signs in town, Carpenter thought about it for a minute.“No, but we should, though,” he said. “We’ve gotta wait and see what happens. Right now, the story still remains.”","Score: 0

cnn,The Rust Belt manufacturing collapse devastated their communities. Two men explain who they’re supporting for president,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/26/politics/manufacturing-jobs-trump-harris-economy/index.html,"CNN—Driving through the streets of Saginaw, Michigan, with Hurley Coleman III, the raw tension between what was and what could be in his community runs deeper than what can be seen through the passenger windows.It’s a feeling that comes through in his every word passing through the streets where he grew up.“Our region has been screaming and crying out, ‘Hey, we’re here. We’re trying to change. We’re trying to grow. Look at all the thing we’re doing,’” he says. “And yet nobody truly paid attention until we became a battleground county.”Politicians and their campaigns are paying attention now, that much is clear.Just as they have zeroed in on a Pennsylvania county about 350 miles away, where we sat at Phil Kerner’s dining room table around fresh pepperoni balls – an Erie County delicacy, his wife informs us – a few days later.“You’d drive down that industrial corridor on 12th Street, just full shops. Just full shops. Amazing,” Kerner recounted, inviting the obvious follow-up.So what happened to that street in Erie?“It’s pretty decimated now,” says the tool and die maker.Two of the most important battleground counties in two of the mostimportant battleground states.President Barack Obama won both handily on his path to reelection in 2012.Donald Trumpnarrowly captured each on his way to collapsing the Democrats’ vaunted “blue wall” in 2016.Joe Bidengrabbed them back four years later – by the narrowest of margins.The closely watched political bellwethers share a familiar economic backdrop, animated by their collapse as great hubs in American manufacturing when globalization sucked the life out of industrial powerhouses in this part of the country.It’s the throughline between the story as told by two families – the Colemans and the Kerners – with generational ties to these communities now fully ensconced in the political Klieg lights.They share a common passion for where they grew up and continue to reside today. With that comes a significant dose of hope that those places can regain some form of the economic success that defined their past.“Many of the matriarchs and patriarchs of our families who are now retired, they’re holding on to their properties. They’re hoping that they have something that they can pass down to the generations, to the next generation,” Coleman says.But their personal journeys are as distinct as the communities within which they were raised.They diverge on their choice of presidential candidate this November. Their explanations as to why – and their observations of where others in their communities stand on things just weeks before Election Day – offer a candid glance at the opportunities and potential pitfalls facing Trump and Vice PresidentKamala Harris.Hurley Coleman IIICNNA story of resilienceThe Coleman family embodies Saginaw’s economic journey since they arrived in Central Michigan, like so many other Black families, during the manufacturing boom that spurred the Great Migration. The automotive industry was the dominant employer – and between General Motors and the rings of suppliers and support businesses that surrounded the plant here, the community was deeply attached to the company’s operations.“Eighty to ninety percent of the adults in the church were employed full time with GM,” Coleman’s father, a bishop in the Church of God in Christ, says of the congregation he inherited from his own dad.“Right now, in our congregation, I have one person full-time employed by the auto industry,” Hurley Coleman Jr. says.In recent years, other industries have started to move in to provide opportunities that had seemed all too fleeting as the broad-based manufacturing tied to major automakers atrophied in the area.Advanced manufacturing across several industries, including major investments in electric vehicle supply chains, have developed, and major hospitals and medical device companies have expanded their foothold.“The story that I’d like for us to tell is that we’re resilient and that we do bounce back and that we do have people in this region that are thinking towards the future and that we have, hopefully, a new generation of people that will love this region as well, just like we do,” the younger Coleman says.Coleman was sitting at his kitchen table as he toggled between sparks of optimism – for his community and his family – and the weight of what he’s experienced over the past several years.The nonprofit that he leads works with the residents who have the least.“Sometimes when they come in there and we are their last hope,” Coleman says. “The lights are shut off. They have no food in the cabinets. Senior citizens have been sitting at home, nobody to call, nobody to help them out.”The best days are the smiles Coleman sees when his team provides that lifeline. But the weight of being a last resort in a community grappling with violence and poverty can be overwhelming.“There are those days when we have so many people that need help. So many problems, so many issues, so many emergencies and calamities that have happened,” Coleman says.Phil KernerCNNA craftsman and a diminishing tradeBack in Erie, as Phil Kerner flips through the binder on his desk filled with sketches, time cards and family history, it’s apparent there isn’t much he hasn’t saved over the years.There’s the copy of the 1920 census that lists his grandfather Edward as a toolmaker in this corner of northwestern Pennsylvania.The story of Edward’s three sons – two toolmakers and a machinist – shows how deeply intertwined his family had been with the trade and their community at one time.That’s no longer the case.“My grandfather did this. My father did this. My uncles did it. My brothers did it. I did it. My kids aren’t doing it,” Kerner says. “That tells you everything, right?”Kerner still loves his tool and die craft and now works for a local family-owned manufacturer of component parts when he’s not in the workshop he built in his basement.His work can be painstakingly intricate, from the granular details necessary in the sketch of a design to the art and science required to build a plastic injection mold.Toys, storage containers, mechanical parts and other items found in homes across the country are likely to contain the type of thing Kerner specializes in crafting.When President George W. Bush famously stood with a bullhorn on the still-smoldering rubble of ground zero after 9/11, the firefighter standing next to him had a respirator mask around his neck. Kerner designed and built the plastic mold for the mask.But Kerner can pinpoint the exact moment he saw his industry take a turn as part of a decadelong shift to cheaper and faster production overseas.“I realized that my best customer for ten years was - I wouldn’t use the word undermining me - but had totally abandoned a lot of us in Erie that were doing work for them,” Kerner recalled.Kerner remains deeply passionate about his profession, so much so that as he saw interest waning in what he viewed as a top-tier trade, he took matters into his own hands.He launched a YouTube channel titled, naturally, “The Tool and Die Guy.” He has more than 25,000 subscribers.“I’m just what they’re looking for - irreverent enough, you know?” Kerner said with a chuckle. “I’m the toolmaker they always wish they had working next to them.”The videos – now more than 170, including one recapping his sitdown with CNN – was the furthest thing from a vanity project in search of social media fame.Instead, it was an effort born of that passion for his trade – and his deep concern that the appreciation for the skill and craftsmanship that goes with it has diminished in the same way that manufacturing has in places like Erie across the country.The impact, he notes, cuts far deeper than a plant and its employees. The entire community takes the hit.“It’s sad to see it as somebody who has experienced the zenith of manufacturing from the 50s up until the 90s,” Kerner says.A street in Erie, PensylvaniaCNN‘Probably going to call Trump’Kerner cops to being “a little bit of a political junkie,” and he pays close attention to the broader economic news in the country.“I always tell people I’m not a Republican, I’m a realist. I think they’re all terrible,” he says.He knows the broader macroeconomic numbers point to an economy that has exceeded expectations and forecasts for several years running. But his view of the economy is tied to what he’s seeing in his household.“It’s not like my wages are going up,” Kerner says. “Not a complaint, but my wages aren’t going up. And I get it - I see that touted a lot. Wages going up. Wages going up.

We’re going to foreclose on you. Who are you going to call?” Kerner asks. “Probably going to call Trump.”He estimates about 95% of the people he works with also support Trump.“I think the general consensus in the business community is Trump’s kind of one of us or one of them, you know, because he’s at least on it,” Kerner says. “You ain’t like the way he did it, but that’s his background.”What he’d really like to see, he makes clear repeatedly, is something that flies far beneath the current political radar. Elevated and uniform apprenticeship standards that take into account the importance of the trade – and the value that comes with it, which should ensure lifelong employment in manufacturing.It is, in many ways, the point of his YouTube videos, which have taken on a deeper meaning for him over time.“As long as there’s an internet, people will know that there was a Kerner family in Erie, Pennsylvania. That the tool and die trade was great. That Phil Kerner did it and taught us how to do the best he could,” he says.Hurley Coleman Jr.CNNMore hope with HarrisColeman’s feelings about the November election are summed up in a single word.“Nervous,” he says. “I’m nervous about the future.”For all of the optimism he conveys about Saginaw’s future, the reality of the policy contrasts between the two candidates is very real in his line of work.He sees Trump’s fiscal proposals as directly targeting the federal dollars that help his nonprofit operate.The idea that tax cuts and deregulation will filter down to those on the lower end of the economic spectrum is something he says has never proved to be the case.“They have no idea the everyday, you know, traumas of a person who’s living in poverty,” Coleman says. “People with money could face hardship that causes them to lose their home or forces them to struggle with the high cost of gas.”“But that doesn’t parallel the person who was living in poverty,” Coleman says. “It’s just night and day.”Coleman supported Biden’s reelection – he and his son, HJ, even spent time with the incumbent when he traveled to Saginaw while still a candidate.He’s now supporting Harris and saw the Democratic National Convention as a positive step in outlining what she brings to the table.But it’s clear Democrats have work to do with a critical constituency.“Many Black men in our area are still yet undecided,” Coleman says. He hears often about the border and whether migrants are taking federal aid that could help people in his community.The pandemic-era stimulus checks, which Trump made a point of putting his name on, also come up regularly.“There are people who think that the stimulus checks that came out during the pandemic and things of that nature are something that’s going to happen again,” Coleman’s father says.Still, Biden’s decision to drop out of the race and Harris’ rise has sparked a new level of enthusiasm, according to the elder Coleman.“Now the conversation is not how bad Biden was or how good Trump was, but what possibly could happen with a Harris presidency,” the bishop says. “I think there’s more opportunistic hope that’s been created in the last few weeks.”Driving down Williams Street with the younger Coleman, just before the Saginaw River, it’s impossible to miss the string of abandoned silos that jut into the skyline.Once an unavoidable blot hanging over the city’s business and arts districts, they were transformed a few years ago into a 70,000-square-foot canvas for contract street artists.For Coleman, the eruption of bright colors and unwieldy shapes represents more than just a beautification project.“What was old, what was outdated is about its experience of having transformation and rebirth,” he says, staring at the mural. “And people are going to benefit off of others’ creativity and desire to see change. And I think that’s what those silos represent. And it’s the future for this region.”The Shine Bright Saginaw Mural Project can be seen across the Saginaw River in Saginaw, Michigan, on June 10, 2024.David Guralnick/Detroit News/AP/File","Score: 0

cnn,An EV plant bolstered by Biden’s climate law sparks hope in Northeast Ohio – but not a revival of its Democratic roots,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/25/politics/ev-ohio-economy-biden-trump-harris/index.html,"Lordstown, OhioCNN—For this long-beleaguered region of Northeast Ohio, a gleaming new 2.8 million-square-foot manufacturing plant symbolizes something that has been fleeting in recent years: hope.Hope that years of promises – so often broken or deferred – have been replaced by action in the form of 2,200 employees at theUltium Cells electric vehicle battery plant, which sits at the forefront of cutting-edge green technology and manufacturing.Hope in the shadow of the hulking formerGeneral Motors Lordstown plantthat closed its doors in 2019, forcing workers like George Goranitis to leave the only jobs and homes they knew.“All the mills shutting down, packers shutting down – the last thing here for a good-paying job was General Motors Lordstown,” Goranitis said.The collapse of the lone remaining cornerstone of a manufacturing powerhouse cut to the heart of a proud community.“Members, you know, weren’t able to handle some of the news,” Goranitis recalled. “And, you know, the situations they were in at that time, they took their own lives. There was divorces because of it. You know, families were ripped apart.”The story of the GM plant closure in Mahoning Valley in Northeast Ohio isn’t new.Nor is the story of howDonald Trumptapped into the anxieties within those communities with his bold promises to bring back the manufacturing prowess of old.Here in Trumbull County, for decades a Democratic stronghold filled with union workers, President Barack Obama crushed Republican nominee Mitt Romney by 23 points in 2012.Ultium Cell assembly and production begins at the Ultium Cells LLC facility Thursday, August 11, 2022 in Warren, Ohio.

That made Trump’s bold declarations all the more resonant with the community.“Don’t move,” Trump said as he pledged to bring jobs back to the region. “Don’t sell your house.”Many of the plant’s workers took Trump’s words literally, according to David Green, who served as the local UAW president during Trump’s term in office.Seventeen months later, GM announced that theplant would be idled. Employees who wanted to hold on to their pensions would be required to relocate to other GM facilities. Houses were sold. Many moved. Others were forced to commute each week to the new locations, leaving their families to do so.Trump railed against the GM leadership on Twitter and urged some kind of deal to reopen the plant.Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Uniondale, New York, on September 18, 2024.Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesRelated articleTrump dangles tax relief targeted toward the voters he’s hoping to winBut Green said his letters to the White House pleading for help were ignored – at least until he appeared on Fox News to make his case.Trump was watching.Shortly after, he fired off a tweet aimed squarely at Green.“Democrat UAW Local 1112 President David Green ought to get his act together and produce,” the president wrote. “G.M. let our Country down, but other much better car companies are coming into the U.S. in droves. I want action on Lordstown fast. Stop complaining and get the job done!”It was a heady moment for Green, who like so many others had followed his father onto the GM Lordstown factory floor and had spent his whole career there until the plant closed.“I ignored it because my mama told me, ‘Don’t give it any credibility, and it goes nowhere,’” Green said. “The reality is my daughter got bullied over that. And I didn’t know until just a couple of years ago when she told me. She was a senior in high school, and kids were blaming me and mad at her and bullying her.”Trump then eagerly touted the start-upLordstown Motorsas the savior he was instrumental in delivering.He dispatched his vice president, Mike Pence, to tour the facility in 2020 with cameras in tow.A few months before that fall’s election, Trump held a major promotional event on the South Lawn of the White House, flanked by prototypes of what the company pledged would be the first all-electric commercial pickup truck.“The area was devastated when General Motors moved out, and then we worked together, and we made the deal on the plant,” Trump said as he stood beside the company’s chief executive.The company would go on tofile for Chapter 11 bankruptcythree years later.The executive who stood beside Trump would eventually settle with federal regulators over claims that he misled investors about demand for the first all-electric commercial pickup truck. He did not admit any wrongdoing.The Ultium Cells plant is under construction in Lordstown, Ohio, on October 16, 2020.Megan Jelinger/AFP/Getty ImagesUltium breaks groundGiven the past several years, there was an understandable skepticism in the community when thenew joint venturebetween GM and South Korea’s LG started construction on its planned electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant, which opened in 2022.Standing inside that plant this summer, Josh Ayers was candid about when he came to believe what the future could hold.“Probably when they actually broke ground. I mean, honestly,” Ayers said. When Ayers left the GM plant and his hometown, he never expected to find an opportunity to return to either.“This gives people in the Valley another chance,” Ayers said as he ticked through the reasons people from here so deeply value the community, from friends and family to the familiar (and highly recommended) local restaurants such as Wedgewood Pizza and the Hot Dog Shoppe.Ultium Cell assembly and production begins at the Ultium Cells LLC facility Thursday, August 11, 2022 in Warren, Ohio.

The results here are, at least on their face, clear-cut.And yet.“It’s a hard time right now, right? Because, you know, the unions have always backed Democrats,” Goranitis said. “Always have.

The goal is to counterprogram the Democratic convention by leveling the kinds of policy-based attacks the former president’s allies have urged him to focus on in recent weeks.But for Trump, who advisers say left the GOP convention confident of a comfortable victory in November, lettingPresident Joe Bidengo hasn’t been easy.One adviser, asked if he expected Trump to watch Biden’s speech Monday evening, said simply: “Of course.”He posts on social media about Biden’s decision to step down – and the Democratic pressure that drove the decision – with regularity. He frequently floated, with no evidence or credibility, the idea that Biden would try to step back into the raceuntil a virtual Democratic roll callnominating Harris made that scenario impossible.“I think he’s a little nostalgic for where things were a month ago,” said a Republican who has spoken to Trump in the last few days. “Understandably.”Retired judge and and informal advisor to Vice President Mike Pence, J.

After months of investigation, the report largely fell flat and contained no evidence that Biden, as vice president, had engaged in activities to benefit his son’s business partners.Trump, however, insisted on adding paragraphs to his remarks summarizing his view of the findings.“I said, ‘No, I want to talk about it, just briefly.’ It’s so sad, because he’s going to be making his speech tonight, and they don’t call him ‘Crooked Joe’ for no reason,” Trump said in York.The former president also levied personal attacks against Harris during his speech and at one point focused on her father,Donald Harris, a retired Stanford University economist.“He’s a Marxist professor. Can you imagine? Does anyone know that? I wonder if they knew that when they did an overthrow or a coup on Joe Biden. I wonder if they knew where she comes from, where she came from, what her ideology is. But you could see it a little bit by this wack job,” Trump said of Harris and her father.The comments about where Harris “comes from” follow Trump’s repeated false attacks onthe vice president’s racial identity. He falsely said last month that Harris – the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India – was “only promoting Indian heritage” and that she only recently “happened to turn Black.” Harris has long embraced and discussed her Black identity, while also honoring her Indian heritage.Trump also attacked Harris’ laugh, which he has mocked repeatedly.“Between his movement and her laugh, there’s a lot of craziness,” Trump said of Biden and Harris. “I’d say a step further than weird. Weird is a nice word by comparison,” the former president added, referencing the recent attack line from Harris and other Democrats that Trump and running mate JD Vance are “weird.”As Trump stood on the floor of the manufacturing plant in York, seeking to portray himself as an ally of manufacturing workers, he said Harris’ economic policies amounted to a “regulatory jihad to shut down power plants all across America.”Trump also falsely claimed that he “won” the classified documents case and that he was “totally exonerated” after US District Judge Aileen Cannondismissed the caseagainst him. Cannon ruled last month that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump, violated the Constitution. But Cannon did not rule on whether Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents was proper or not.In a battleground state where natural gas drives much of the economy, the former president on Monday repeatedly attacked Harris over her past support for a ban on fracking, saying that she was “totally a non-fracker.” As an unsuccessful candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Harris backed a ban on fracking, but her campaign now says she no longer supports such a prohibition.","Score: 0

cnn,Record number of early votes cast in Georgia as election gets underway in battleground state,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/early-voting-record-georgia/index.html,"CNN—A record number ofearly votes have been cast in Georgiaon Tuesday as residents headed to the polls in a critical battleground state that is grappling with the fallout from Hurricane Helene and controversial election administration changes that have spurred a flurry of lawsuits.Roughly 252,000 ballots have been cast Tuesday, Gabe Sterling of the Georgia secretary of state’s office said on X. “Spectacular turnout. We are running out of adjectives for this.”The previous first day record was 136,000 in 2020, Sterling said.The swing state is one of the most closely watched this election, with former President Donald Trump trying to reclaim it after losing there to President Joe Biden by a small margin four years ago, leading Trump and his allies to unsuccessfully push to overturn his defeat.Those efforts have loomed large this year as new changes to how the state conducts elections have been approved by Republican members of the State Election Board, leading Democrats and others to mount legal challenges, many of which have yet to be resolved even as Election Day nears.Despite the massive turnout on Tuesday, the process appeared to go smoother this year for some Atlanta-area voters who spoke with CNN.“Last time I voted, I voted in the city and the lines were out the door. They only had like, maybe like three people working,” said Corine Canada. “So people honestly just started leaving because it was like that. Yeah, like, ‘This is too long. I can’t sit here (and) wait, I have to go back to work.’ But here, no, it was easy.”In this November 2022 photo, people wait in line for early voting for the midterm elections at Ponce De Leon Library in Atlanta.Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images/FileRelated articleWhat to know about early voting in Georgia and North CarolinaParts of the state are continuing to recover from Hurricane Helene, which hit the US last month and wreaked havoc on several other states in the Southeast. Georgia election officials say absentee ballots went out by the US Postal Service as scheduled and were not impacted by the storm.“So far, we have seen just over 250,000 voters request absentee ballots. Perhaps in the next week or so, we’ll see that rise up to 300,000  – and that we think will probably look like around 5-6% of all voters will be voting absentee this cycle,” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said on Tuesday.Experts say that some new state laws that tightened rules for absentee ballots and cracked down on the availability of drop boxes may make the option less appealing than early in-person voting.While many drop boxes were available 24/7 in 2020, this year there will be fewer of them, and they will be in election offices or early vote locations with hours that tend to mimic normal business hours.It’s also possible that the state could continue to see high numbers of early votes given that Georgia law now mandates two Saturdays of early voting and allows for two Sundays of early voting if a county desires.Raffensperger said Tuesday that safeguards are in place for a safe election and that in addition to every race being audited, officials will also randomly audit voting equipment to inspect.“Pulling out a piece of equipment, a random audit on Election Day, bring it to headquarters and then verify that it is recording the votes accurately, that it has not been hacked by any bad actors out there,” Raffensperger told reporters.Raffensperger, who was in Trump’s crosshairs following the 2020 election,re-certified the resultsafter a statewide machine recount in December 2020 that confirmed that Biden beat Trump by just 11,779 votes out of nearly 5 million ballots cast in the Peach State.Legal fights continueMeanwhile, state judges are scrutinizing a number of new rules passed by the Trump-backed Republican majority on the State Election Board that Democrats warn could inject post-election “chaos” into the Georgia.During a marathon court hearing Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney suggested that a rule requiring ballots case on Election Day be hand-counted by poll workers might have been passed too “late in the game” to remain in effect for this cycle. That rule will be under another state judge’s microscope Wednesday as part of cases brought against it by state and national Democrats and civil rights groups.McBurney is also still considering a separate rule passed by the board in August that requires local election officials to conduct a “reasonable inquiry” into election results before certifying them – a mandate that Democrats say could give county election officials broad authority to delay or decline altogether their certification of the results “in a hunt for purported election irregularities.”But McBurney sought to clear up anyuncertainty around certificationin a ruling this week in which he said that local election officials have “a mandatory fixed obligation to certify election results” in the days following the election – dealing a blow to a GOP election official who had asked him to rule that her duties around certification are “discretionary.”What voters are sayingIn line at an Atlanta-area precinct, two voters who identified as Democrats said they were casting ballots for Harris in an effort to avoid the kind of “chaos” they said surrounds Trump.“It is essential that we vote today simply because we want to prevent as much chaos as possible because Donald Trump has proved to be the most vicious, uneducated, racist individual that we have encountered,” said Fay Ainsworth.“Well, we’ve got a crazy person running to be president and a very competent young woman opposing him,” said Joseph Henry King Jr., 77.Kareem Rosshandler, 32, who identifies as an independent, said he was voting for Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein to send a message to Democrats over their support for Israel in its war with Hamas.“We’ve been calling for an arms embargo for the last year and they haven’t been responding, and all the protests and the placards won’t matter if we don’t deliver that message where it really counts, which is at the ballots.”“I mean, the Green Party wants to get rid of the Electoral College,” Rosshandler added. “And that I think is fantastic because right now we have a two-party system, and the only thing worse than that is a one-party system and we’re not that far from that.”CNN’s Mounira Elsamra contributed to this report.","Score: 0

So, offering a bottle of water or a snack to voters within 150 feet of a building where ballots are being cast is still banned.The law also sought to ban offers of food or beverages within 25 feet of a voter standing in line, even if it was well beyond 150 feet of the building where ballots were being cast. A judge paused that provision, allowing voting rights groups to offer so-called line relief to voters that may find themselves waiting in particularly long lines.Hoping to speed up results but worries about uncertaintyThe Peach State made several changes to try to get voters faster election results. At 8 p.m. ET on election night, counties are required to report results from their early in-person and absentee ballots. As counties tabulate the Election Day vote, they’ll provide updates at regular intervals. The goal, according to Georgia’s secretary of state, is to provide speedy, fair and transparent results.A polling station is pictured during the primary elections in Atlanta in May 2022.DUSTIN CHAMBERS/ReutersRelated articleGeorgia group that pushes election misinformation gains influence with election officialsAt the same time,several new rulespassed by a Donald Trump-backed Republican majority on the Georgia State Election Board are creating uncertainty around the post-election process. The board passed a rule requiring a hand count of the number of ballots at each voting location, which could potentially delay the reporting of results.The board also passed rules allowing county officials to examine extensive election materials prior to certifying and requiring those officials to conduct a “reasonable inquiry” before they certify results.There are ongoing lawsuits related to all the new rules, which Democrats and voting rights activists worry could be exploited by county-level officials who want to try to challenge election results or delay the certification process.North CarolinaImpact of Hurricane Helene damageOfficials in North Carolina have been scrambling in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene to ensure residents are still able to cast a ballot.“I think there will be a drop off, it’s hard to really predict how much,” Bob Phillips, executive director of Common Cause North Carolina said of the storm’s impact on turnout. “But I’m encouraged so far by the response the State Board of Elections has done to educate folks on what to do and how to vote.”FILE PHOTO: A resident enters a FEMA's improvised station to attend claims by local residents affected by floods following the passing of Hurricane Helene, in Marion, North Carolina, U.S., October 5, 2024.

Acceptable forms of ID include a driver’s license, passport and student photo IDs that have been approved by the state election board.There are exceptions if a voter is unable to provide identification and one of those exceptions is a natural disaster. In that case, voters fill out an ID exception form that accompanies their ballot. The state election board notes that county election boards are required to count provisional ballots that include ID exception forms.Ballot selfiesBoth Georgia and North Carolina prohibit photographing ballots.“In this day and age, everyone’s taking selfies, even people in the boomer generation like me,” Phillips from Common Cause North Carolina said. “But there definitely is a law that says no selfies.”Phillips noted that voters are still able to take their phones into a polling place if they want to look up information about who they’re voting for. That’s not the case in every state.CNN’s Tierney Sneed contributed to this report.This story has been updated with additional developments.","Score: 0

cnn,"Israel assures US it plans to target Iran’s military, not oil or nuclear sites, source says",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/israel-iran-military-oil-nuclear-sites/index.html,"CNN—Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have assured the United States that a counterstrike on Iran will be limited to military targets rather than oil or nuclear facilities, according to a person familiar with the discussions.President Joe Biden, who has conveyed in public his opposition to striking Tehran’s nuclear and oil facilities, discussed Israel’s plans with Netanyahu during a classified phone call last week. In that conversation, Netanyahu relayed to Biden his plan to hit military targets, the person said.The Washington Postfirst reported that Netanyahu had reassured Biden of his plans to avoid nuclear and oil targets.Responding to that report, Netanyahu’s office said it will consider US opinions but ultimately decide itsresponse to Iran’s October 1 attackbased on its own national interests. And American officials said they were still closely coordinating with Israel as it decides how to respond.“We listen to the opinions of the United States, but we will make our final decisions based on our national interests,” Netanyahu’s office wrote on X.The White House previously described the phone call between the leaders last week as “productive” and “direct.” It was their first conversation in nearly two months.“Our commitment to Israel’s defense is ironclad. We will not discuss private diplomatic discussions and would refer you to the Israeli government to speak to their own potential military operations,” a spokesman for the White House’s National Security Council said Tuesday.Israel’s deliberations over how to respond to Iran come at a moment of high tensions in the year-long conflict, which has expanded beyond Gaza into Lebanon. At the White House, officials have worked to limit Israel’s retaliation to the barrage of ballistic missiles, hoping to prevent a wider war.Still, Biden and other top officials have maintained Israel has a right to respond, and have said they were in close coordination with their counterparts as they mulled a decision.A strike on oil fields that could send energy prices soaring would be unwelcome weeks ahead of the US election, officials have said. And hitting Iran’s nuclear facilities could trigger the full-blown regional war that Biden has desperately sought to avoid.American officials have said they expected a measured response from Israel, believing the country did not want an out-of-control conflict with Iran. But Biden’s leverage with Netanyahu has been limited as he has struggled to bring the violence to an end in Gaza and contain a wider war.","Score: 0

cnn,Two House incumbents seek to woo the other party’s voters in Pacific Northwest swing seats,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/crossover-incumbents-pacific-northwest/index.html,"Ridgefield, WashingtonCNN—Dozens of families lined up outside the Clark County Fairgrounds here on a recent Saturday, their young kids eager to ride on tractors, toss balls into massive vacuum truck hoses and add new stickers to their tiny construction hats.Democratic Rep.Marie Gluesenkamp Perezstood before the crowd with her husband, Dean, and young son, ready to cut the caution tape-style ribbon that would signal the start of Dozer Days.“I don’t know about you guys, but we have been talking about how many sleeps until Dozer Days for about a month,” she said into a bullhorn at the recent campaign stop. “Thank you all for being part of a culture that believes in making stuff, and being proud of who we are as the best tradespeople in the world.”The construction-themed event is designed to introduce young children to careers as journeymen linemen fixing electrical lines or vacuum truck operators cleaning storm drains – the exact kinds of jobs Gluesenkamp Perez has advocated during her first term in Congress representing this rural district in southwest Washington, even if it has meant pushing back on Democratic efforts to cancel debt for college students.As Gluesenkamp Perez faces a rematch against far-right Republican Joe Kent in one of the most competitive races in the country, focusing on this corner of the Evergreen State and its issues could be the key to holding on to a district thatDonald Trumpcarried by 4 points in 2020 and is likely to win again this November.Washington’s 3rd Congressional District is one of 21 “crossover” seats whose House representative is of the opposing party to the presidential candidate who carried the district four years ago. Those seats – five held by Democrats and 16 by Republicans – will likely determine which party controls the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Two of those seats are here in the Pacific Northwest: South of Gluesenkamp Perez’s district, another freshman congresswoman, RepublicanLori Chavez-DeRemer, is seeking reelection in a seat that backedJoe Bidenby 8 points in 2020.Such seats – where bipartisanship is a necessity, not a choice – have become increasingly rare. Twenty years ago, there were nearly 60 crossover districts,according to an analysisby the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. In these districts, incumbents usually assert their independence from their national parties and tout their work across the aisle, as their opponents seek to nationalize the contests and urge party allegiance.And as partisanship has increased, it’s become harder for these candidates to navigate the demands of both aNovember electorate that rewards bipartisanship and base voters who punish party disloyalty in primaries.For Gluesenkamp Perez, finding that balance has involved joining a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Washington, DC, for daily CrossFit workouts to find legislative partners. It’s also meant voting against the Biden administration on key issues such as student debt cancellation, a vote that prompted outraged progressives from across the country to flood the Yelp and Google pages of her family’s auto repair shop with negative reviews.“For me, it’s not productive to think about it as I’m asking people to make a political choice,” Gluesenkamp Perez said in an interview between campaign events. “I’m just trying to bring back power and respect to people in the trades and people in my community.”Primary defeatsOver the past two years, voters in this region have felt the consequences of ousting centrist House incumbents.Gluesenkamp Perez’s predecessor, Jaime Herrera Beutler, was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after January 6, 2021. But in 2022, after representing the district for more than a decade, she lost a top-two open primary, finishing behind Gluesenkamp Perez and Kent, a retired Green Beret who had Trump’s endorsement. The Democrat went on to win the general election by 2,600 votes.A few miles south, a similar story played out in Oregon’s 5th District, where longtime Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader, a member of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition, lost his primary to progressive Jamie McLeod-Skinner. Schrader had Biden’s endorsement but had angered the left by voting against Democratic priorities such as Covid-19 relief funding and allowing Medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs, which he opposed in a committee hearing prior to backing a narrower Medicare negotiation plan on the House floor.McLeod-Skinner lost the general election to Chavez-DeRemer, the former mayor of Happy Valley, by 2 points in a district that stretches south from the Portland suburbs to Bend.Like Gluesenkamp Perez, Chavez-DeRemer has touted her efforts in Congress to work with the party that dominates her district. The pair, who often share the same flights between Portland and DC, touted their work together on the House Agriculture Committee’s Forestry panel and inadvocating border security funding and defense-only aidto Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.Chavez-DeRemer has sought to localize her race against Democratic state Rep. Janelle Bynum despite the national implications.“Sure, it does make sense that people want to put you in a box of red or blue,” Chavez-DeRemer said of her experience running in a Democratic-leaning district. “But really, it’s just sticking to what you’ve been doing, that people trust you, and then they’ll vote for who they believe is going to best represent the district as a whole.”Eager to avoid a 2022 general election rematch, Democrats waded into this year’s primary to back Bynum over McLeod-Skinner. Bynum previously defeated Chavez-DeRemer twice in state legislative elections around Clackamas, a Portland suburb.Former President Barack Obama speaks at a campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris at the University of Pittsburgh on October 10, 2024.Jeff Swensen/Getty ImagesRelated articleObama’s reemergence on the campaign trail for Harris comes as he recognizes his own legacy is at stake“I think Democrats did realize that, ‘Whoops, Kurt Schrader wasn’t exactly the far-left guy we love with the Green New Deal and all that sort of thing,’ but they realized that they’d gone a little too far,” Schrader said. “I think Janelle is still very progressive, but a little bit less so.”Democrats say they’re optimistic about their new candidate and believe they have more experience with the new congressional map, which changed last cycle after Oregon gained a sixth seat following the 2020 census. They are also leaning into the national implications of the race.As part of a tour through battleground districts, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries recently held a news conference with Bynum in her Clackamas campaign office. The two were flanked by dozens of supporters, including several union members, an effort to counter Chavez-DeRemer’s endorsements from organized labor.Bynum spoke of her own record in Salem, where she led bipartisan legislation to fund the state’s semiconductor industry and backed Oregon’s abortion protections, which were enacted in 2017 after Trump became president. She argued that Chavez-DeRemer had “sided with the most extreme members of her party,” blasted her record on abortion and criticized her decision to endorse Trump.“She’s stood by Donald Trump at every turn,” Bynum said. “She’s standing by her man even after he was convicted of 34 felony counts.”Jeffries said Bynum would be a vote for passing federal abortion protections and advancing what Vice President Kamala Harris has described as an “opportunity economy.” He also touted Bynum’s two previous victories against Chavez-DeRemer.“We’re going for the trifecta, going for the triple crown, and we’re going for the three-peat,” he said.Abortion and crimeBoth parties recognize the significance of the two seats, which could play a role in tipping the balance of power in the House, where Democrats need a net gain of four seats to earn control. In both races, Democrats have leaned into abortion rights and Republicans have focused on crime.“The Pacific Northwest is key to a House Democratic majority,” Dan Gottlieb, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a statement. “As different as these districts are, the through lines are clear: Lori Chavez-DeRemer and Joe Kent are content to stoke on the chaos and dysfunction we see in Congress and let politicians dictate women’s health care decisions.”Ben Petersen, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, tied the two Democrats to the fallout from Oregon’s decriminalization of hard drugs.From left, John Duarte, Tom Kean Jr. and Matt Gunderson.CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images/Matt Gunderson for CongressRelated articleHouse Republicans attempt to avoid 2022 letdown with new tactic on abortion: ‘We’re both pro-choice’“Republicans are full speed ahead to grow our majority because voters in both districts reject Democrats’ extreme agenda fueling Portland’s crime, fentanyl and homelessness crisis,” Petersen said.In Oregon, Democrats have pointed to Chavez-DeRemer’s shifting stances on abortion. Shesupported the overturning of Roe v. Wadeand said during her 2022 Republican primary thatshe would “be in favor of passing”legislation that would ban the procedure after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is around six weeks. In Congress, she opposed legislation that would have blocked federal subsidies to insurance plans that cover abortions, but she also voted against a defense bill amendment to reimburse service members who need to travel out of state to receive abortions or other reproductive care.Chavez-DeRemer has said that she would support the will of Oregon voters, who overwhelmingly support abortion rights, and that she is opposed to a national abortion ban. She said she opposed the defense bill amendment because she wanted to use that legislation to focus on national security and argued it wouldn’t affect Oregonians’ rights, in part because the state has a fund to help pay for people’s travel expenses.“I am not pro-choice enough for the choice groups. I’m not pro-life enough for the life groups, because I’m where most Americans are, which is down the middle,” Chavez-DeRemer said in an interview.Republicans, in turn, have pointed to Bynum’s record in the state legislature, as well as her past support for a 2020 ballot initiative that decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs and sought to expand funding for addiction treatment.“Not only was it a failed experiment, but people are dead because of it in Oregon,” Chavez-DeRemer said. “That accountability cannot just go away – you don’t get to just say, ‘I think this is not working out.’”In 2020, Bynum backed the citizen-led initiative Measure 110 with reservations, noting that it would have looked different if it had originated with the legislature. Though the initiative passed with more than 58% of the vote, Bynum and other lawmakers voted torecriminalize drugsthis year as the state saw a rise in fentanyl use and a delay in the treatment protocols.“There were a lot of people in my caucus who wanted to continue to work through the status quo and say, ‘Well, we haven’t given it enough time,’” Bynum said in an interview. “And there were those of us who were like, ‘My kids can’t even ride the public bus because people are tweaking out.’ … That wasn’t what we signed up for.”She has also defended her record on public safety, pointing to bipartisan police accountability reforms she led in 2021.Other criticisms have scrutinized Bynum’s record on handling sexual harassment allegations. One Congressional Leadership Fund ad pointed to a campaign contribution she made to a colleague in the legislature who was under investigation for sexual harassment.In recent days Republicans have also latched onto a complaint that alleged Bynum didn’t report allegations of misconduct made in 2019 against a campaign operative assigned to her 2022 campaign by Oregon House Democrats’ campaign arm.Bynum is not under investigation. She has said that she did report the misconduct to the accused person’s employer. A spokesperson for the Bynum campaign called the allegation that she did not report harassment an attempt to “smear” the candidate that was “not based in reality.”“MAGA Republicans are lying to Oregon voters about Janelle Bynum’s record because they know their candidate has no record to stand on here in Oregon,” the spokesperson wrote.A nationalized raceWhile Gluesenkamp Perez has sought to distance herself from national Democrats – she has declined to endorse Harris or say who she will vote for in November – Kent has campaigned as a Trump ally.He’s also sought to move away from some of the policy positions and controversies that alienated moderates in his first run – whenhe called for a national abortion banthat would overturn protections in states such as Washington,spoke at a right-wing rally in DCaimed at supporting insurrectionists charged in the deadly January 6 riot, and frequently had to disavow or distance himselffrom White nationalists and Nazi sympathizers.Earlier this year, Kent laid out three things his campaign would do differently: stop discouraging Election Day voting, focus more on local issues and reach out to a broader base of Republicans. He has leaned into his personal story, including his status as a Gold Star husband after his wife was killed in 2019 by a suicide bomber in Syria, and hastried to mend fences with moderate Republicans. On abortion, he now says he doesn’t support new federal legislation on the issue but instead wants to promote pro-family policies, such as making diapers tax exempt.The contrast between the two candidates’ approaches was clear at a recent debate with Gluesenkamp Perez. At one point during the debate, both candidates had the opportunity to ask each other a question.In response to Kent’s question on why she voted against House Republicans’ legislation to ban transgender girls from playing on girls’ sports team, Gluesenkamp Perez said she took a “libertarian” approach to the issue and worried it would have subjected young girls to genital examinations.She then asked Kent why he called her legislation to block a rule that would have made table saws more expensive a waste of time.“While our southern border is wide open, while the price at the pump and the grocery store is really hurting working Americans, Congress is doing these little performative measures,” Kent said. “We need to do these big lifts to get the federal government bureaucracy out of our daily lives, in terms of our business and our natural resources industries, secure our border, stop the out-of-control spending – then we’ll talk about table saws.”Eric Burleson, a 45-year-old saw mill worker, said Kent did a better job at debating, but he preferred the points Gluesenkamp Perez made.“It seems like he was focusing more on the country, what he could do for the country, and she was focused on what she could do for our area itself,” he said.Former Manchester, New Hampshire, Mayor Joyce Craig, left, and former New Hampshire Sen. Kelly AyotteDerek Stokely/WMUR-TV/APRelated articleNation’s most competitive governor’s race tests the power of ticket-splitters in New HampshireBurleson said he voted for Kent in the 2022 general election but voted for Gluesenkamp Perez in this year’s August primary after getting a personal phone call from her office when he wrote in about an issue. The Longview resident, who voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, is the sort of voter Gluesenkamp Perez has sought to win over. Burleson said he’s unsure of how he’ll vote in the presidential election, but he’s leaning toward Glusenkamp Perez at the congressional level.“I don’t really choose between straight party lines. I kind of go with whoever I think has the best ideas,” he said. “If it’s a Democrat for one office and a Republican for another one, whoever has the best ideas, in my opinion, is probably who I’d vote for.”In a brief interview following a town hall in Vancouver, Washington, Kent argued that his top priorities are local ones.“I think the biggest issues right now, especially for Congress, it’s the out-of-control inflation, which is handled in DC, but it’s a very local issue,” he said. “And same thing with the border. That seems like a very big national issue, but if you look at what fentanyl has done to the community here, it’s pretty local issue as well.”At the Vancouver gathering, Kent and his supporters leaned into those national topics. He echoed his warnings of an invasion at the border, saying there were “young and fit men” crossing into the US and joking that people should stay away from the US Capitol on January 6 because it’s “a trap,” after one voter spoke of a rumor that Democrats wouldn’t certify the election results.After another voter asked what Republicans plan to do about the “cheating,” Kent went after Washington state’s all-mail ballot system, saying he didn’t think “Democrats import 10 to 12 million illegals here out of the kindness of their hearts,” and, to paraphrase Trump, that his margin in November must be “too big to rig.”Kent conceded his narrow 2022 loss to Gluesenkamp Perez after paying for a recount but has asserted that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud influencing that result.Kent urged those in the room in Vancouver to vote straight ticket to counter Gluesenkamp Perez’s efforts to sway Trump voters.“That’s her entire strategy right now,” he said. “We’ve got to get all of our people who are going to get a ballot to vote Republican all the way down.”Joan Dunn, an 84-year-old retiree from Vancouver who attended the event, agreed. Democrats, she claimed, tend to vote with their party, while Republicans will vote for people who are “nicer.” It’s a lesson her party has yet to learn, she said.“It doesn’t work that way,” she said. “That’s not how you get control of the Senate and the House in order to do the country’s business.”CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that former Oregon Rep. Kurt Schrader voted in a committee hearing against a proposal to allow Medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs but supported a narrower plan on the House floor.","Score: 0

The House GOP campaign arm, however, reported a six-figure donation from billionaireElon Musklast month as the party seeks to defend its razor-thin majority in the chamber.And with Democrats riding a wave of donor enthusiasm, the latest filings with the Federal Election Commission also showed some key outside groups ramping up their activity, while a leading pro-Trump super PAC unleashed a massive wave of independent expenditures to help Republicans close the gap.Harris’ surgeHarris has fully erased the financial edge that Trump momentarily gained over the summer, when the former president outraisedPresident Joe Bidenin two of the final three months before Biden withdrew from the race in late July. The vice president took in nearly $190 million directly to her campaign in August – more than quadrupling the $44.5 million that the Trump campaign said flowed to its principal campaign account that month.The Harris campaign also dramatically outspent the Trump campaign in August, burning through about $174 million. It plowed most of that into advertising – $135 million – as it raced to introduce Democrats’ newly minted nominee to voters on an abbreviated schedule. Some $6.4 million went toward payroll expenses and $4.5 million to text-messaging outreach.In this April 2022 photo, North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson joins the stage with former President Donald Trump during a rally at The Farm at 95 in Selma, North Carolina.Allison Joyce/Getty ImagesRelated articleExclusive: Harris campaign launching new ad seeking to tie Trump to Mark RobinsonBy comparison, Trump’s campaign spent just $61 million last month, with the lion’s share – more than $47 million – going toward media buys.Despite the spending spree, Harris’ main campaign account entered September with $235 million in available cash, far surpassing the $135 million remaining in Trump’s coffers, the latest FEC records show.The late Friday night filings offer just one snapshot of candidates’ financial strengths.The Trump and Harris campaigns are aligned with an array of committees that file disclosure reports on a separate schedule. Harris’ broader network announced it had raised acombined total of $361 millionin August, nearly triple the $130 million Trump’s operation said it brought in.Harris’ fundraising dominance has helped give Democrats a significant edge in advertising bookings this fall, including in key battleground states. And the vice president and her allies are overwhelming the former president’s presence on social media. Democrats have spent $137 million across digital platforms since Harris effectively became the party’s standard-bearer in late July – more than triple Republicans’ spending, a CNN analysis of data compiled by the ad-tracking firm AdImpact shows.Party powerFriday’s campaign reports show that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee – the party arm engaged in House races – significantly outraised its GOP counterpart, the National Republican Campaign Committee, $22.3 million to $9.7 million.The DCCC also entered September with more cash on hand, $87.3 million to $70.8 million for the NRCC, funds that could be pivotal in a highly competitive battle for the House, where Republicans are defending a narrow majority.One of the notable donors seeking to help House Republicans stem the Democratic tide of cash: billionaire Elon Musk, who records show gave the House GOP campaign arm $289,100 in August, the largest federal donation disclosed by Musk so far this cycle as he steps up his Republican giving.Tesla CEO Elon Musk, top row, second from right, is seen during a joint meeting of Congress at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on July 24, 2024.Kevin Mohatt/Reuters/FileChief Technology Officer of X Elon Musk speaks onstage during the ""Exploring the New Frontiers of Innovation: Mark Read in Conversation with Elon Musk"" session in Cannes, France on June 19, 2024.Richard Bord/WireImage/Getty ImagesRelated articleHow Elon Musk has turned X into a pro-Trump machineThe tech magnate – the world’ richest person – endorsed Trump in July. And in another indication of his growing political influence, a super PAC Musk helped form recently ramped up its activity in the presidential contest, spending more than $40 million since mid-August. That includes more than $22 million on canvassing efforts on Trump’s behalf, helping to fill in a critical role. The Trump campaign, asCNN has previously reported, has opted to outsource much of its ground game operation to outside organizations.Party committees focused on Senate races raised comparable amounts last month.The National Republican Senatorial Committee brought in $19.1 million and its Democratic counterpart, $19.2 million. Each spent more than it raised, with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spending $31.6 million and the NRSC, $26.5 million.Democrats narrowly control the chamber but face an unfavorable landscape this year as they defend several seats in states that have previously backed Trump.Outside groupsHarris’ fundraising prowess has put pressure on a network of outside groups supporting the former president to help close the money gap.MAGA Inc., a leading pro-Trump super PAC, spent more than $88 million in August alone on independent expenditures on behalf of the former president’s campaign, funding a blitz of TV advertising, according to its monthly filing. That’s more than MAGA Inc. has spent in any month this year and roughly twice as much as it spent in July.The super PAC received a total of $25 million last month from a range of wealthy supporters, including $10 million from Wisconsin roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks and $5 million from billionaire financier Paul Singer. It ended August with $59.4 million in cash on hand.On the Democratic side, FF PAC, a leading pro-Harris super PAC, reported raising nearly $37 million last month, with $3 million coming from Facebook co-founder and billionaire investor Dustin Moskovitz – by far his largest federal donation of the election cycle.

His campaign spending suggests otherwiseThe cash stockpiled across Harris’ affiliated committees tops the $295 million that Trump’s political operation said it had available in its bank accounts and underscores how much Harris’ historic and late-breaking candidacy has energized donors and transformed the 2024 race. The $361 million is by far the best monthly haul for either party this cycle.If this rate continues, Harris is poised to collect more than $1 billion in the condensed campaign window between becoming the party’s de facto nominee in late July and Election Day. She’s already raised more than $615 million since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on July 21, her campaign noted Friday.“In just a short time, Vice President Harris’ candidacy has galvanized a history-making, broad, and diverse coalition – with the type of enthusiasm, energy, and grit that wins close elections,” Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement.Last month’s haul toppedthe $310 millionthat Harris and Democrats raised in July and came amid the fanfare of her announcing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and formally accepting her party’s nomination at last month’s celebrity-studded Chicago convention, which also included appearances from Biden and two of his White House predecessors.CLICK FOR CNN’S ROAD TO 270 INTERACTIVE ELECTORAL COLLEGE MAPHarris’ campaign also touted August as the best grassroots fundraising month in presidential history, saying it drew record support from first-time contributors. Nearly 3 million donors gave to the Harris political operation in August, with 1.3 million of them making their first donation of the 2024 election cycle, according to her aides.The third strongest grassroots fundraising day of the campaign came on August 6 – the day Harris announced Walz’s selection, campaign officials said.The August haul does not best the monthly fundraising record of $383 million set by the Biden-Harris political operation inSeptember 2020at the height of that presidential campaign.The August totals announced by Trump’s team show his fundraising pace has slowed – with his election effort bringing in slightly less last month than the $138.7 million it had collected in July. An earlier CNN analysis of donations that exceeded $200 this cycle found that some ofTrump’s biggest fundraising dayscame in May around his felony conviction in New York, exceeding even the amounts the campaign reported collecting in July during his party’s nominating convention.Harris campaign officials said they are plowing their money into reaching voters, citing a “weekend of action” in the coming days that will feature 2,000 events and a $370 million digital and TV ad campaign running through the election. The campaign said it also has established more than 312 offices with the Democratic Party and employs more than 2,000 staffers with the party across battleground states but warned of a close, hard-fought contest in the home stretch.The presidential campaigns will release a full accounting of their August fundraising and spending later this month in filings with federal election regulators.","Score: 0
